1. Love the home diffuser. It is soooooo quiet. My old one sounded like a cargo train.
2. Not accurate.... too tight on my wrist and sometimes had to restart itselfI had to return it for a refund so I could purchase a different one.
3. Perfect for keeping my toddlers glasses on his head plus it comes with a lot!
4. Saved me money by salvaging the waterpik that I currently have (over buying a new one). Seems to have similar design flaws as the original, like the water doesn’t all come out, which harbors a moist environment that mildew and mold love. The quality isn’t as high, though, the hinge to the door broke on one side and snapped off on the other side. The door can still seal the hole, but it’s now a separate piece. Still usable but not ideal as I almost lost the door down the drain.
5. I use this occasionally but not everyday. It is very salty but it whitens my teeth dramatically, so its worth it.
6. Works just fine
7. Great overall, but I would prefer if they have the braided chain to prevent leaks.
8. Good paper but not much paper on each roll. Have to load new roll way too often.
9. While I didn't get much from it, the wife loves this product.
10. Great product easy to take and I believe effective. I trust Life Extensions as a company I consider them to have integrity and they certainly have a good reputation.
11. Terrible. I have size 12 feet. These inserts were at least 4 sizes to small. They were also paper thin. Spend the extra money for Odoreaters or comparable.
12. This broke within a couple of days of starting using it. Poor, poor quality.
13. 4.5 Bought these because all of the groomers were booked up for a long time after COVID closings. These arrived promptly within two days. They worked well on my little dog. It also came with extras: scissors, nail file. Great bargain.
14. Very strong massage gadget. Does not replace a great hands on massage but it does what it says it can do: knead muscles.
15. This machine is a good foot spa but it is a bit small for my taste. I am a man and men tend to sit with their legs slightly apart. If that is the case with you this unit will become annoyingly small after using it for a while.
16. Title says it all
17. Got this for my teenager, it seems to work a bit when he will actually wear it.  Honestly can't be more specific than that. I do notice a marked improvement in his posture when he wears it though, so that has to be worth something.
18. I have used this for almost 10 years and don't sleep without it. Great white noise machine. I travel with it, would definitely recommend.
19. Great product!Just received it today and it fits both shoulders. I only froze the gel pack for one hour because I wanted to try it right away, I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone with shoulder stiffness.
20. Very good shisha. First time trying fantasia. Love it, especially the rainbow flavor
21. Simple shoe brush.  Works as expected. nice cover flap
22. My feet thank you HoMedics
23. Arrived quickly and as described.No issues and does not upset stomach
24. The addition of this pad took our 15 year old massage table to the next level. While I would have liked for the pad to be a little thicker, it is a great value and we are very happy with it.I think it would easily fit a larger table and it is advertised to fit up to a 34" x 76" table.We have only used the cool side so far.
25. I use this so I can hear my iphone ring over all the equipment running in my shop. works great, can be turned up to a very loud ear piercing setting. Just what I needed.
26. This is a very solid and large pin. Steel shafts are thick enough to not bend too easily, but that does make it harder to work in through thicker cloth material.
27. Bought these as a birthday gift for my 6-year-old niece after buying a pair for myself.  I switched to piercing earrings because I wanted one less decision to make in the mornings while getting ready for work.  My niece has had the same pair of piercing earrings since she was 6 months old (gross, I know).  Not only does my niece loving switching out her earrings every month, she also loves knowing that she matches her auntie.
28. Brush head is a little small but it works.
29. I LOVE THIS LONG WEARING LIP COLOR. THIS SHADE IS A SOMEWHAT LIGHTMEDIUM PINK-MAUVE SHADE, BUT IS NOT TOO LIGHT FOR MY FAIR SKIN. I HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING COOL-TONED LIPSTICK THAT IS NOT TOO BRIGHT, & FINDING PINKS & MAUVES THAT DO NOT LOOK ROSY OR PEACH ON ME. THIS IS PERFECT WITH MY FAIR PINK SKIN WITH BLUE UNDERTONES. IF I WANT A SLIGHTLY DARKER SHADE, I MIX IT WITH ANOTHER COLOR.
30. This makes my skin feel so nice and clean, also super soft afterwards! I love it :) Def worth it, and you're not going to find it cheaper anywhere else!
31. Seems better made than the one I had before (from another company).
32. I bought these on a whim and took them as directed. Seemed to do the trick as far as a cleanse.
33. This lotion completely dried my skin out. The more I applied, the drier it became.
34. Hard to tell if it's actually working, but from ask appearances it's keeping my bathroom air clean of germs and mold spores! It at least does a decent job of eliminating odors, I think. And it's a comforting presence, to know it's always whirring away!
35. Hard to lose..great for traimas.
36. This is my 4th reorder.
37. That nutritional supplements are available without non-therapeutic fillers is a good idea. Or, am I missing something? BS should provide more detailed results from their QC lab testing, more than just claiming &#34;Pure and Clean.&#34;  I plan on using this Glucosamine product for a worn-out, old knee for 2-3 months after which I would update this review. I received this product no charge contingent on posting a review.UPDATE:I too had a problem with receiving product with a too soon expiration date. BS' customer service resolved this issue via e-mail, good job.Sorry to say, though, that this supplement by itself does not seem to help my old knee. Maybe in combination with others, it may help or at least slow progression.FYI, BulkSupplements contracts manufacture of its products in the Peoples Republic of China, unless I'm mistaken. As far as I know, BS has no independent validation of GMPs nor USP verification. Their customer support, readily available through e-mail is cooperative and does try to resolve any problems in a timely manner, but regarding assuring the quality and purity of their products, they told me that they will send you a COA, a certificate of analysis from a lab that they won't identify. My opinion then is that simply printing &#34;Clean and Pure&#34; on their products' labeling is not enough.  Trust but verify as someone once said.
38. Resolve your rug cleaning problems. We purchased our own steam cleaner a few years ago and found this cleaner to beat all the rest....  Anyone who has self cleaned their carpets knows  the products they use makes a big difference in how many times they have to go back and forth. This Resolve concentrate 2X does the trick. Cleans up spills and  leaves such a clean smell
39. I used it maybe 10 times and it stopped working. I used a small torx screwdriver and took the screw out of the bottom and used a small flat screw driver to put in the slot to slide the cutter head off of the plastic base. I took my old razor head (tabs broke off like everyone elses) and compared and they are very similar. But whatever grease they are using fails pretty quickly and becomes sticky causing the hair to get stuck. I suppose you could clean their grease off and use a white lithium grease or something and it would work fine but I just decided to swap my old OEM cutter head into the new plastic base. Works great now!
40. Love it. I sit at my home office all day and it's made a huge difference.
41. This was delivered with a broken handle so holding it was awkward.  It snarled & pulled my hair.It's in the garbage now.Amazon apologized for damage & gave an account credit.
42. This is a great quality nano geocache, with a strong magnet. The two geocache rainproof paper log rolls with metal roll ups in the middle are an additional great value.
43. This wash-in helped restore the water repellency of my favorite nylon shell. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it didn't make the shell totally repellent, but maybe that's asking too much. It did a very good job, doesn't smell or leave a residue, and doesn't appear to affect the breathability of the fabric.
44. If you have small glasses like mine, it can be hard to find clip-on sunglasses. These work perfectly. You might need to bend the outer clips to get them to fit over thick lenses, but that's no big deal. Note that the sunglass coating does scratch relatively easy, so keep them protected when not in use.
45. Bought this oil to aid with bad yeast under the armpits and upon putting it on the itching and swelling were under control. I will be buying this again.
46. Good supplement best vitamin C I've found thus far.
47. I have a model 454 that must be at least 30 years old, and it keeps on going.  I've tried electric white noise makers over the years, but they just aren't the same.  Can't really explain why, they just aren't.  When mine finally conks out, I'm definitely going to get another one!  I live in a noisy area, a bad one too with gunshots, loud cars, noisy neighbors and the like, and this unit does an amazing job keeping the noises down.Just did a Google search for the model 454, I got this..."It is billed as, "Sleep-Mate" by Marpac of Wilmington, N.C.. It is model number 454.This item is circa the 1960's. "1960's!!!  Wow, guess it's lasted longer than I thought!
48. Good product
49. good product
50. I bought this to keep with me on my recent trip to several Asian countries. Those countries are notorious for not providing soap in restrooms. This travel soap worked perfectly for my needs. I am incessantly needing to keep my hands clean and this helped my mild obsession. I also wear contact lenses and require clean hands for handling the contacts. I never got an eye infection, despite the questionable water supply. I'll attribute that safety to the good soap I was using. Buy it!
51. If you know and love Sangre de Grado, this is a good one.
52. These are decent if you have pain in the ball of your feetfoot. I even put these on my custom made Orthodics and they do relieve the pain. I do notice they move around although they have reusable on the package I am not sure how well they will stick but will keep this updated as pain in my feet keep me from doing a lot of things.UPDATE: Not real happy with these after some time ONLY because they will roll up when you put your shoe on. Maybe from the glue rubbing off, not sure bt it becomes a hassle even though it does help.
53. This might fit on your neck if you are a pencil neck like Adam Schiff. Otherwise it is way too small for the average joe. Didn’t even fit my wife.
54. I purchased TOBS Mr. Taylor to try out the scent and to give me a break from the sandalwood. The scent of Mr. Taylor is very pleasant and I could smell it for a good part of the day. The performance was identical to the sandalwood scent, excellent as always! Very nice lubrication on the face, lathers up nicely in my scuttle, and washes out of my brush and off my skin cleanly. Over all, I am very happy with this scent!It should be noted that this particular product is 60g, 2.03 oz. However, I expect to get a good number of shaves out of it, even though it is technically a trial size and is exactly what I wanted. I didn't want to spend much money on a tub of TOBS that I wouldn't like.
55. I rarely give 1 stars.. I Loved this thing but after 5 uses it died.. Won't turn on. No idea what happened. When it did work I loved it. - Even purchased one for a family member (before it's sudden death)
56. This purchase was just fine.
57. This stuff has a very strong fruity medicinal odor. It's not horrible, but it's so strong that a few squirts in the shower fills the whole house with the smell. It seems to leave the shower glass clean and clear, but I've used other daily products that worked better and didn't smell so much. I won't be buying this again.
58. I bought these "blue blockers" because I read that wearing them before bed time would help overcome the negative effect of tv and computer screens on melatonin levels. I don't know if that's true and wearing them that way was too distracting, so I didn't give them a fair test. However, I do enjoy wearing them while driving on long distance trips. They seem to be relatively well made and they fit over my regular glasses.
59. These stainless steel roller balls leak bad, it literally drips from the ball. Horrible.
60. I have a 6mo old and a 3yr old, and have one of these germguardian sanitizers in each of their rooms. We hardly every get sick, I would like to think these sanitizers play a part in that. They make just enough noise to act as a noisemaker, as well as put off just enough light to act as a night light (very dim one). They seem to do a decent deal for removing odor (baby diapers) from their rooms.I have had one of these sanitizers in my older kids room for about a year and half and it is still working great. Had to replace the bulb once. I got a really good deal on the ones I bought, on amazon. Most of the time they are overpriced, so wait and you can get a decent deal on these sanitizers. If the price drops again, I will get one for my room.
61. Compact classy little pill case. Not much else to say. It’s so simple, but looks nice on my keychain with brown leather and other brass items.
62. motor is weak
63. Treated my tank with this. Good results.
64. These are nice tweezers. inexpensive too.
65. Couldn't find the liquid version of this anywhere in stores. I was SO glad to finally find it here on amazon. Nothing takes out the itch of poison ivy or bug bites like this does. Will order again when I near running out.
66. Difficult to put on hearing aid.
67. I bought a new office chair and the seat was terrible!  My son had a Purple at work and suggested the purchase.  It's much better with the cushion, although I wish I'd have purchased the larger one, &#34;The Ultimate Purple Cushion.&#34;On Amazon, the Ultimate is (today) $178 while on the Purple site, it's $129.  This one &#34;Royal&#34; was $79 here as well as on the Purple site when I purchased, however today I notice that the same &#34;Royal&#34; is $111.27 here (offered by Purple).  Very confusing pricing.  You'll want to examine all possible sites prior to making a purchase.
68. Simply put, the head strap is too short.  I would not buy again.  Otherwise, mask is ok.
69. Good fit. Be sure to use soap and wash the nose oil off before a swim so they don’t slide off while swimming.
70. I ordered some generic eyeglass case from Amazon and my Gunnar MLG Phantoms did not fit in them in the slightest.  Didn't even know Gunnar made an accompanying case, but I'm very happy I stumbled upon these.  The quality seems very good; they're made with something like a hard leatherette, so it gives it a nice feel.  Plenty of room inside and I don't feel like my glasses are squished.  I'm considering buying another pair of Gunnars and if I do, I am absolutely buying another one of these with them.
71. It's a good scale and it does interface with the Fitbit app. I think the body fat percentage feature is total BS as mine varies by several percent day to day. I find the weight is within reasonable limits of variation day to day given that I weigh myself immediately upon waking up every day. I think the interface could be more seamless. It doesn't automatically plug my weight into the Fitbit weight tracker. This may be operator error.
72. i like the ingredients and so far i like the product
73. Very cheap for a 3 pack, and the color is great but thats because of BabyLips
74. the smell is perfect love it I read reviews before the purchase and they were right better than Ax cannot go wrong with a brand that has been around forever
75. I used this as a filler for some pneumatic pressure gauges that needed filling.  It works great for that.
76. Makes good party joints, almost two ZigZag papers long.  Too long for my daily use, and no extra belt like the smaller RAW rollers, but a fine machine none the less.  Colorado approved.
77. I have had a habit in my home of saying, what did you say ? I went to a play and couldn't hear my grandchild talking, so I thought, time to try something. I am planning to get a hearing test, but no way could I spend thousands on hearing aids. I am very impressed with these amplifiers. They charge in a little box, & the box also charges. They have 9 volume levels. You push a button and when you hear two short beeps, you are at top volume. One more push & you are back to # one. They also have a feature where you hold the button down to change mode, for a noisier environment. I have not tried all of this feature as yet. One day, the sound was fainter & per booklet, there could be wax on the amplifier. I used the tool provided to change the wax guard. The instructions seem complicated, but once you try the amplifiers, the instructions quickly make sense. I am positive these amplifiers will allow me to hear the actors in a play quite easily. I like hearing some extra sounds I have not heard for some time, like the bell sound of a spoon hitting a certain cup. I am glad I got them. In the mornings I now say, I have to go put on my ears ! Lol
78. Best heel cream I can find.  My skin builds calluses and cracks terribly.  This is the only product I’ve found that really works quickly to soften and heal the skin.
79. Didn't work out for me.- This thing is way too small. 16" in width and 9" in height barely covers the width of my back and I'm just an average size person.- The straps they provide are not even close enough to  wrap around a standard chair to hold it in place.- After sitting less than 10 minutes, my back is so sore.
80. My wife loved the clamps. The chain however broke on the first use.
81. Well I don't think I will need something like this, until I broke my CPU cooler and had to try to fix it and finally to replace it.Remove the old thermal paste is a pain, you end up making a mess because that thing sticks to everything, so with that bad experience I decided to give a chance to this products and they exceed my expectations by far.Is really simple to use and way too effective, just a few drops over the processor, 30 minutes after use a soft cloth to clean and that was it, repeated the process with the old CPU cooler I have to replace and it looks also great.So if you plan to change your CPU cooler, is a good idea to have something like this to clean up the old thermal paste from the Processor and the CPU Cooler.
82. Great work great
83. Not sure what kind of aliens we stole this material from but if you have an enamel tub and or tile shower (especially white), your first mission is to spray some tub cleaner and without letting it sit, wipe it with a wet Mr Clean eraser and prepare to be amazed!
84. This is great that it has so many different shaped wells for meds.  I think my pills were just too small, and over 50% of them ended up being crushed.  It will probably work perfectly on larger pills.
85. these are not the quality of others i have bought directly from local pharmacy stores.  they will not clean in the ear-only around the entrance to the ear canal
86. I just used it for the first time on a 12' x 3' section of vinyl siding above my back patio. It used to take me 30 minutes with a step ladder and a sponge to clean the mildew off these vinyl panels. Today I did it in less than 5 minutes using my DocaPole 6-inch Scrub Brush with Extension Pole. And I didn't need a ladder. Next I tackled the difficult job of cleaning mildew from the area around the attic vent at the point of my house which is 35' high. I was able to effectively clean this hard to reach area using a 22' ladder and the 12' DocaPole Extension and Scrub Brush. Previously, I was never able to clean this area around my house's attic vent. Now it's mildew free and I have  the tool to keep it clean in the future. This is a marvelous item of equipment. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver. The scrub brush does a terrific job of cleaning mildew off of vinyl siding. I highly recommend it.
87. This is so easy to use and great for keeping wet hair up and out of the way.
88. I am so VERY upset! This product not only took out the ugly dark coffee stains, but it ruined the beautiful shiny finish on the inside of my vintage coffee pot. If you have a vintage coffee pot do not buy this! It will ruin it.
89. I got this machine promptly and everything they said was there is there. The power source works, the machines are good. There is one bad thing, i'm not sure what the problem is but the needles hook will hardly fit onto the machine part, you have to force it but it still works just as well. just like everyone else says the ink is only for practicing and the practice skin sucks, use a honeydew melon to practice on, and if you are going to do it on real skin at any point, buy skin candy outlining ink.
90. My favorite sleep mask, and I’ve tried several. I doubt I’ll ever go back to the foam ones.
91. Nice lemony smell and taste, if any. Easy to take.
92. After visiting my chiropractor several times with severe, debilitating neck and shoulder pain, he recommended that I start taking fish oil along with his regular adjustments. He stressed that high quality fish oil was a must.  I started taking Carlson's fish oil (about a tablespoon a day) and it did for me what the chiropractor could not, completely diminished my neck and shoulder pain. I love it!  I will never stop taking it, and I have recommended it to many friends who suffer from the same neck and shoulder pain. I don't know any of the science behind it, I just know it has worked for me for the past two years.  You must be consistently taking it, and it takes about two weeks to notice a difference.
93. Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for.
94. The Smoke Buddy really works as advertised. It absorbs most of the smoke and smell. And every so often, when full, i order a new one.
95. This replaced a bulky beam balance scale that indicated different weights depending on where or how well the counter weights fit in the notches.  I don't have this problem with this scale.  You just get on and read the big numbers.  My wife hates to see her true weight for a change.  Not only is this scale accurate, it looks really nice.  We have it on a hardwood floor in our bedroom.  It takes up very little space.  For the price, you can't find another scale that looks and operates as good as this one.
96. Product seems well made. I have the one with extra padding. The bad part is the strength of the massage - its simply too low. Its weaker than the handheld massage devices in my opinion. I cannot see how anyone with a serious ailment gets any relief from this. Even at highest settings I did not feel it to be effective and heat was not working at all or felt like it.Does not look like it will be comfortable or recommend to put it on a sitting position. This also occupies considerable amount of space so if you have people sitting at same location you will need to move it each time.
97. The Berta Hair Straightener 1 inch worked alright on my hair. My hair is past my thighs, and thick. I spend a lot of time trying to dry or straighten it. The control buttons are on the inside of the handle, I had some difficulty reading the digital display ,and it took some time to heat up. It was a very good price though and it does work well.
98. Vegetable Glycerin ( or glycerol ) is a clear ,odorless liquid that has a sweet taste. The liquid is produced from plants usually  palm oil , coconut oil or soy. It has many uses cosmetics, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste. I use it in my  vapor juice or e-juice. In e-cigs it is generally referred to as VG. It produces more vapor than propylene glycol, another component in e-cigs. I find the 99% pure Kosher VG is an outstanding product with an excellent price. I also use Vegetable Glycerin with essential oils and I make moisturizers and hair conditioners with it. It needs to be stores away from sunlight and has a shelf life between 12 - 18 months ( shelf life does vary )
99. Very much enjoy the Natural Silk Sleep Mask, is comfortable and often am a day sleeper having worked the night through; since light comes through the eyelids, this is a propitious thing to use, silk so fine do not even notice it.  Always kind of surprises me that itworked so well.  TY Sleep Restoration, the concept is important.
100. yecch, do not like this one, seems pure enough but leaves a bitter, bitter taste for me.
101. I like it. Works as advertised. Not a perfect substitute for an honest to goodness paint touch up job. But you must know that no wax product is that fantastical. It does however mitigate very nicely the little speckly imperfections and tiny chippy marks in your blue paint. I used this product in black when I had a 12 year old black vehicle and it worked great! This blue is very good, not as great as the black, but on my Nissan Murano blue from 2007, it created a great improvement.
102. taking it for cancer
103. these look better for men instead of women
104. Reading the description it said the bag would hold larger gifts. The gift I had barely fit in the bag and it was almost impossible to tie the ribbon.  Very disappointed in the item for what I paid.
105. Not really sure it this item really does anything. Might be more of a placebo thing. Its not quite either, you can hear it within 10 feet.
106. I bought the white color since it's the cheapest.The masks are soft and comfortable.  They fit my wife's face much better than all the other masks she tried (the other masks were always a little larger for her).The only reservation I have is these masks only have 2 plies.  But then, given how cheap the white ones are, I can always double up.
107. Last summer we had a chance to travel to asia. I bought this product for my kid to use while we travel over there. It worked very good. It prevented the kid from mosquito bite. The smell was mild.
108. This item was purchased to help dispense the liquid hand cleaner from the bottle.  It makes just the right amount for washing... without wasteful over supply.  Makes financial help with dispensing of the Hibiclens... just the right amount.  Good to have if you use Hibiclens in your home.
109. Bought last year to have a cozy, warm electric throw in the living room.  It's well made, cozy and warm. A quality product.
110. Excellent product for hair that won't lie flat.  I've been using Tancho Tique for more than 50 years.
111. My favorite toothpaste.
112. These pads work great nice
113. Now i can finally carry my E-pen with me and get to it fast, case is made very nice and durable, I love it
114. I purchased the lavender scented spray and am delighted with the results. I did a deep-clean on my mat by spraying it down and letting it sit for 2 minutes, then wiped it down with the microfiber cloth and let it sit dry overnight before re-rolling. The scent is pleasing and leaves the mat smelling fresh for a couple weeks. If you are sensitive to scents, I would purchase the unscented version. Easy to use and the ingredients are safe. This bottle will last you a long time, even with daily use.
115. Do you need your tums to survive a nuclear blast? Then you need this holder. I bought one of the smaller Cielo double chamber ones a few years ago for Tums and Advil. Held 2 Tums and 7 Advil. Tums increased the diameter of their 1000mg tablets and they no longer fit so I got this. This thing holds 6 of the 1000mg tablets for those extra stress inducing days. Nice!
116. I've had a brass pill case for many years that was wearing out so when I went to buy a new one, I was quite disappointed to find pharmacies now only sold super low quality aluminum cases. Literally everything about them was staggeringly sub par. Figured I might as well drop the extra cash and get a good one. Not disappointed on this choice. These have good O-ring fit, every edge inside and out has been either radiused or chamfered, excellent alignment between all the parts, and good thread engagement. She seller mentions it is a fine thread but that is a relative thing. The threads are 0.8" x 18TPI which is a good balance for this application and considering that is a very non-standard size, these were probable made on a CNC which explains the price.
117. I've had this for a few years now. It's the solution when your spouse snores like a freight train and you're a lite sleeper. Thank you Marpac!
118. These work okay. I used them twice and they are a bit awkward at first but you have to wear a long sleeve tee or other type of sweater otherwise they are noticeable. Take a little while to get used to but after a few minutes they prove to be comfortable.
119. i love this, have it at the head of my bed, and i use it every single night. it blocks out noise.
120. top cover doesn't cover whole compartment and supplies fall out, had alot better med bags.. Had to switch back to my old bag because It kept letting equipment fall out..
121. NIftalicious!!!
122. I followed the instructions to the letter. Instead of defogging the fog lasted longer, and would not dissipate,
123. Didn't fit my nosebridge
124. I absolutely LOVE this!!!! It works perfectly.
125. Perfect!!!!  I bought this for my daughter's dorm room.  She loves it!
126. Assembly was easy.  The stool itself is well-padded but not very sturdy.  The hydraulic mechanism used to raise and lower the stool jams frequently.  My niece and nephews love to spin around on it, so it does make an excellent children's toy.  Not that great of a place for adults to sit, however.  I do not recommend this stool.
127. Perfect for our at home tanning bed in our Cleveland Browns basement!
128. Very disappointed. These were the first pair of shears for me, as I am a nursing student.  These could barely cut through two layers of gauze.
129. Didn't really give accurate readings. Constant  with the numbers and not by a few but by many.
130. The only thing that works for sore, swollen feet!  I've used it for years and now I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT while pregnant.  Nothing else even comes close
131. The nail boards are excellent,very pleased....thank you
132. Good for my yard waste.
133. Nice bag for walker. Mother in law loves it. Well made.
134. Great cards to have at work, study, or just remembering.
135. This is a very cheap product. Does not remove a thing
136. These are nice sturdy straws, and I liked that they came in a variety of sizes (the openings).  I do wish they had some that were shorter in length, as my youngest son, who has autism, has been going through a straw &#34;phase,&#34; and 9 inches is too long for the cups he uses.  Otherwise though, these are great so far (we have been using them for a couple of weeks).
137. My daughter actually takes this for vitiligo, because it has most of the supplements she needs. Between this and the additional supplements, we are seeing improvements; I have to believe this is contributing.
138. Used them when I had to stand for a long time.  Helps my feet a lot
139. Bought these socks because I love them and always go for this brand but the package I received was torn open and one of the socks itself was torn not going to bother returning because they are still usable but still annoying for the price..
140. We've been using this product for years because we really like how it works. Took a while for me to get used to the smell, but my wife likes it. Everyone's different. But I wouldn't buy it for over $10bottle.I used to buy this at Target, but they apparently don't sell it in the store anymore. You can still get it shipped for less than $4bottle with a $35 order.
141. It was love at first brush!!!I've been using the Apalus brush a few times a week for a couple months now.  It's easy to use, saves me time, gives me great results (I have &#34;fluffy-puffy-frizzy&#34; hair if I don't load it w products and punish it w heat!), and it's a lot less damaging than the flat iron.  I usually use my flat iron to tame the shorter hair in the front, but as for all the rest of my hair, it's lovely!
142. These panties are hands down the most comfortable undies I've owned, period. The sizing is perfect and they don't ride up or down, ever.  You can tell these are quality-made panties as the texture feels sturdy, yet they are incredibly soft to touch. I can tell they will last. Also, another great feature about these panties is that they don't show the panty line when you're wearing tight pants. For such comfortable wear, you will not look like you're wearing granny panties!I bought these for $39.90 (and it appears the price has gone down a bit - now $36.90), but I will definitely be purchasing another pair here in a couple of months.
143. I love the citrus essential oils because they brighten up the room and leave a freshness to the environment.  I use this in my aromatherapy humidifier during the day.  It smells great and I think it helps to lift the spirit.  This is a great size and a really good value.
144. These are fantastic
145. Wow. Im so happy about finding this product , I hope amazon continues to sell it . Recently I had shingles and then got contact dermatitis ( allergy) so I’m trying the “ free of “ this one cleans as the ultra stain release original does just no fragrance. Tide and amazon come through again.🙌🏻
146. Very tasty! Not a big fan of the Chocolate Cream flavor, it was just okay but the Peanut Nutter is awesome. Looking forward to trying other flavors! The texture is soft and I love that these are low-carb and low-sugar but still taste like a guilty treat. Very convenient to have around - keep a few at my desk in case I can't get away for lunch break or need something to get me through that second half of the day. Not recommending them as a meal replacement, of course, but they've been handy when life gets busy!
147. Fairly nice wallet, a little more distressed looking than the picture shows.
148. We love these. Great taste and consistency. $5 a bag cheaper than Vitamin Shoppe. Delivered to my door. Awesome!
149. Not for tender skin but it is the best joint pain reliever!
150. My puppies ignore this. I was disappointed became they chew everything, shoes, furniture chairs, etc. I had wished they would love this instead. They do like pigs ears.
151. Have not reviewed product effectively to give a response at this time.
152. Perfect for my Miele front-loader.  Cold wash is so much more friendly to the environment and my wallet and this is the best detergent I've found, and definitely get more than 50 loads out of a box.
153. highly recommended to buy
154. I like that these absorb some of the urine and allow the excess to pass through onto the next pad but Thought these would keep the urine inside the PADDED pants along with a mega pad that I use under these, so 3 pads thick and still leak onto the bed liner AND up her back during the night. I looked for some kind of gel pads that would actually HOLD the liquid but can't find anywhere. This is insanity. Wish I had the means to invent my own product that would make life easier for caregivers and that would make me a billionaire because I know exactly what is needed but oh well! Ain't going to happen.  I give up.
155. and this wonderful stuff prevents rashes, sores, redness from her diaper undies. I love that it has no petrol chemicals or other toxic garbage. I thank GOD for the Honest company.
156. I wish they were different grades of courseness, but these are all the same and a little too course. But ok.
157. Great throw pillow cover! Good quality.
158. This device is awesome! It has allowed me to have mobility after footankle surgery. It can also be easily moved out of the way for another driver to use the car normally.By the way, I did not purchase it here. I RENTED it directly from the seller, which is a great option for those that only need it short term.
159. easy cleaning
160. Lathers nicely, convenient pump, moisturizing, but smells like a cheap pina colada you wish you hadn't bought.
161. Works fine, and the price is good. I'd buy this again!
162. If mixed in pitcher of liquid the taste is masked,  if put in a small amount of water it tastes a little harsh.  I take it before bed and believe my sleep is enhanced.
163. Easy to take. Really work well.
164. Love it so cute.
165. Broke after a week of use
166. Ruby wrapping paper is the best!  I love the weight and folding ability of Ruby paper!  The colors are beautiful!
167. I have bought many different brands that are “biodegradable” . These hold up and do not put off a bad smell!!
168. Noise canceling white noise. Adjustable to make different tones. Perfect for if you work overnights and sleep during the day.
169. As far as I can tell the product is as described but it took forever to get to me. It was delayed to begin with (2 months from when I originally was suposed to receive this!) And even more so when the manufacturer failed to &#34;scan properly&#34; according to USPS which made the delay even more severe. It was ridiculous.
170. Great brush especially for travel.  Fits with the dry oil tin.
171. This was not for me. The straps were too wide to fit under my arms comfortably
172. Easy to use and makes my solid surface counter tops look great
173. I tend to have issues with narrow belts curling all up. This one may eventually too, but I like that it has a wider belt & buckle. The elastic top is nice too to keep bottle from sliding out if you bend over. Nice quality product.
174. I got this for my husband's lower back pain.  When I first put it on his back all was well.  A few minutes later he was fanning his back saying it felt like lava.  We washed some of it off because he couldn't take it and he said it felt better.  I'm not sure if I applied too much, but I used a very little amount to start with.  Less than a pea sized amount.  After the inital lava stage he said it did cool and seem to numb his lower back area and was soothing, but that the initial skin melting stage wasn't worth the cooling after wards.  If you don't mind EXTREME heat, this would probably work for you.  We've used sombracream and icey hot extra strength with no problem... but those are nothing in comparison to this.  We received this product for a discount in exchange of an honest review.  My opinions are my own.
175. These are too big to provide any compression. I’ve also tried SBSox, Copper Compression and Roxofit, all ordered based on their individual sizing recommendations for my 8” arches. These by far fit the largest (in size small). They are designed more like the SBSox style which is longer and extends the length of the metatarsal region. This is good for people with longer feet. But these have a thick seem that looks like it would be uncomfortable too. I ordered these because they came in flesh tone, and had to return the copper compression flesh tone ones due to poor construction quality. But I can not recommend these and they are going back immediately without me even trying to wear them to see if they are supportive.
176. Sprays on in a fine mist, love this!!
177. Great info needed for quick reference
178. Seems silly to write a review for a sleep mask, but this one is worth it -- and I feel obligated to share it with ya all who are shopping for one.  I have been a sleep-mask addict for 10 years (that's what having a child can do to you, evidently). I literally cannot fall asleep without one. This &#34;Earth Therapeutics&#34; is the one and only for me (but I have 5 of them, ha ha!) Sleep masks are either too slippery, don't stay on, too transparent, not enough coverage, too uncomfortablethick (too much coverage), or too small or too big or not adjustable around my head to fit right. It's neat that it has a soft side (I love during cooler weather) and a satin side (great for warmer weather). It's the perfect size ... not too little but not too big. I don't like to notice the sleep mask, it has to feel natural. I tried the memory-foam type ones and ones that seem sort of molded for &#34;comfort,&#34; and they were awful. What's more -- they last. They last through washes, the velcro and elastic are not &#34;cheap,&#34; they are strong and stay solid. I have had the same mask (my first one, a pink one, which was a gift) for over 5 years and it's still going strong. I have 5 of them just to rotate and keep them washed to keep my skin clean at night. I can't even recommend a runner-up ... this is the end-all, be-all.P.S. If you try the masks with the headphones (so you can listen to tunes as you fall asleep), I just want to say how disappointed I was. I couldn't find a good, comfortable mask with built-in headphones. So when I want music at night, I just use headphones separately. Let me know if you find a great Earth Therapeutics light-weight sleep mask with built in headphones that don't add bulk and annoyance, ha ha!
179. I'm an ER RN. I work 12-16 hour shifts. Compression socks are essential and I've tried a ton and these are my absolute favorite
180. This is exactly what I expected. A little smaller than a full roll of TP. A fun and silly COVID-19 birthday gift! It was not used, so judging on what I know about TP, it will work as expected.... lol
181. My dog had a broken toe. We used this for a week. Exactly what we needed. 👍👍 We kept it dry an wouldn't let her chew or lick her foot.

184. These are the worst wraps I've ever used. I'm an Esthetician and need durable wraps. These wraps snag so easily.After just one wash, they looked horrible, I had to throw them all away. They also don't hang right.
185. We live in a small town and no where around here sells these. A friend recommended these for my son who is now taking showers by himself. These are great. No need to use a washcloth. We have purchased many over the past year. They last a long time and are tear free for sure!  We will keep buying as long as these are made.
186. Amazing absorption, yet very gentle on painful wounds.
187. It does not work at all, I wasted money!!
188. Love this holster - easily pump lotion onto my hands to continue without breaking touch.  Great product.  I have used only lotion so far and no leakage.
189. the roller ball sticks and you cant use it im so disappointing
190. The lid is cracked and leaked all of the liquid out poor packing and broken lid had to throw away not happy I wouldn’t recommend this product
191. Let’s face it, unlike men, it can be difficult for a woman to go to the bathroom outside. We purchased some acreage and needed something that would be easy to use with our Luggable Loo. This product was convenient and did a pretty good job controlling waste smell.
192. Great product!! Will order this shake again!
193. Use these to brush my infant son's teeth.  They are soft, they clean well and he loves to chew on them.
194. I have a friend that asks me to order it for her, she swears by it. She uses it for her shower, with her hair getting in the drain it doesn’t want to drain. Said she had tried everything, but this product is the only thing that works!!!
195. Colors were wonderful. I haven't had any problems wearing these for extended periods of time
196. This seems identical to the name brand version but at a better price.
197. THANK GOD they make a liquid version of astaxanthin!!! My husband can not swallow pills and this is the ONLY liquid astaxanthin I have found ANTWHERE! It's pricey, but it's the only one around so we continue to buy it! Astaxanthin is VERY GOOD for your health! It's a SUPER antioxidant! Wish they made a chewable gummy for kids!!!!! We take our astaxanthin daily as part of our everyday supplements! My husband has not complained of any taste aversion...I mix this in with his liquid fish oil and add it all to a small shot glass of juice...he drinks it every morning... (Poor guy! But what can you do when he can't swallow pills!?!?!) He doesn't complain, just drinks it down!!!
198. Tasted way to horrible to keep down I tried taking it three times every time I did I threw up and had bad heartburn and kept burping the flavor which was disgusting.
199. Love this veggie scrubber!! Easy to wrap fingers around and get a good grip. Love that its wooden.
200. Awesome product!
201. worked great for a web
202. Just what I've been looking for.
203. great product at a great price  Fast delivery
204. this stuff is MAGIC! i wore the booties under socks for about 3 hours, and 3 days later my feet started peeling like a snake, and after 5 days of peeling and rubbing in the shower and a little lotion with socks over, i had brand.new.feet! this is not a sandals product while it is working.
205. This isn’t pure horsetail herb. It contains an unknownundisclosed quantity of dextrin, but, it’s enough to taste slightly sweet. The seller should disclose they’re not selling pure horsetail. If you’re on a low carb diet or suffer from IBS, you’ll have problems. Could be the dextrin is made from wheat, so caution if you need gluten-free.
206. I used to have one of these mops when they first came out it was one of the as seen on TV versions this is the best mop hands down it literally picks up every micro dust of hair or debris that is on your floor. If you have pets or get a lot of dust in your area this is definitely the mop you want to have.
207. This is a great product for my long hair. Nothing else works for me. Thank God I found it on Amazon!
208. bristles are not sturdy enough to brush teeth and the bamboo feels like its going to give me a splinter... waste of money
209. My husband loves the fact this handy little kit doesn't have to be plugged in - but instead uses a battery and does a fantastic job!
210. If you have a need for vegetable glycerin, this is a great product. Wonderful packaging and a very reasonable price. I've purchased a few different Essential Depot products and I've never been disappointed!
211. This is great in my basement bath where we keep an XL litter box for 2 cats. I was impressed. Will be purchasing 2 more units to put in other areas of the basement. Highly recommend.
212. Plates and napkins are nice, thick, and high quality. Kids liked them too. We had a small party for our kiddo and they were the perfect number for the kids attending in a package of 8 of each item. Received quickly and in perfect condition.
213. I purchased this repellent for my infant because it didn't have deet (Eww, deet is smelly!). I absolutely HATE seeing mosquito bites on her, including her face!! I needed to get something gentle on her skin and face and as non smelly as possible. This stuff actually seems to be working and has not caused any irritation when lightly used on her face! We recently went for a walk in a different neighborhood from our own (to escape the buggies) and as soon as we got out of the car we were bombarded with mosquitoes! I quickly applied the repellent on the baby first and you could see the mosquitoes flying around her and the stroller, never landing on her skin.Smells good, and repels. I'd say it works!
214. Worth the purchase! Grew at product
215. I had read that lavender was a natural deterrent to moths. We had been experiencing a moth problem in our older condo we had just moved into. It seems to be working and we love the fragrance of lavender. This product is far more preferable to mothballs!
216. Great Product!
217. They don’t block any noise at all.  I tried inserting them many different ways.  Followed the directions precisely.  They’re worthless.
218. I've reviewed a lot of pre-workout supplements over the years and I'm always amazed by how few of them want to admit that their primary boost is caffeine. The next question is how much caffeine is included, which they almost never acknowledge in light of the daily recommended amount (400 milligrams, in case you're wondering). Tattle gets props for listing the amount in the ingredients.130 mg for one scoop is a little more than one-fourth of what's healthy for you, so this is a significant boost -- not counting any tea or coffee or soda you drink during the day. I'm sensitive to caffeine so I only take a teaspoon and that's plenty of energy for me.The bigger problem is how dry it tastes. I'm guessing it's the "dash of Monk Fruit for a tart, berry flavor." I'm not a fan. Still, I mix it with the rest of my shake in the morning and although the taste was initially a shock I've gotten over it.
219. Cleaned my mat great and did not leave it tacky like other I have used.
220. They work just as described.  A good number of these will come in handy.  They arrived promptly too.
221. Once you get hooked on Floralife you will want the value bucket.  And here it is.  I have definitely noticed a difference in my flower quality after using this product and I will continue to use it.
222. I wanted to replace the nylon poufs in my shower with something that would last longer. This is easy enough to use, but it is very soft and has ZERO scrubbing or exfoliating factor. It causes soap to lather up well. It's probably for someone with very sensitive skin who doesn't like exfoliating. I like that the back side can be used to massage the scalp. It would be better if this had a loop for hanging.
223. I wanted to stop using disposable, non-biodegradable nylon mesh poufs, but this was not the right replacement for me. This is a fabric, so when it gets wet, it's sopping, and lumps together. You can rub it against your skin, and it might have similar exfoliating qualities as a nylon pouf if you rub hard enough. Mostly, it feels smooth, like using a towel bunched up. The thing that bothered me is that it does not lather well. Also, the wood bead is a nice decorative touch, but it will still get moisture in it, and it will mildew. Take off the bead, and this might be a good alternative for bathing small children. It would be soft against their skin.
224. Purchased for my sister who has CF.  Fits great. And gives us piece of mind during a pandemic.
225. The lid of this pill cutter does not tilt back far enough.  After cutting the pill it sticks to the bottom.  It is not very easy to use.  My pill also seemed to stick in the rubber holder.  Returned it.
226. Cannot get the protector off the brush, GOING TO HAVE TO SEND IT BACK..
227. My youngest has had issues staying asleep at night. Purchased this and she seems to like it as she has been sleeping better at night.
228. I have a lot of low backhip pain, and after a day of sitting at the computer all day kills me. I can't afford a fancy ergonomic office chair, so I was ecstatic to see this show up. I've been using it for a couple weeks now, and I'm amazed that I feel as good or better at the end of the day as I do when I start working. It conforms easily to my back while still providing excellent support. It's not overly molded so that it only fits one body typeshape. The unique design of the rubber stays firm when and where needed but is soft and cushy where needed too.One thing to note is that the cover is a stretchy fabric like spandex which allows it to stretch over the cushion but fit closely to it. There are two loops on the back which allow you to run a belt or rope to tie it in place onto your chair. However, since the fabric is so stretchy and the cushion fairly heavy, it pulls down into the seat rather than staying against the chair back, so I still have to push it up and into place when I come back to the chair. I'm thinking of sewing a more structured cover that won't stretch so much to keep it in place better.I received a discount in exchange for an honest review.
229. The lavender smells amazing!  I love the little towel that comes with it.  Great investment for your mat!
230. As expected
231. srsly?  I'm sure the buckets would be great if they were useable. find a local dealer so this doesn't happen to you.
232. The amount of carbs is way too high, the taste is less than pleasant.  Some may like them, they are not what I hoped for I guess:(
233. These banners are impactful! They look expensive, and really make a statement in the entryway. I receive tons of compliments. Good buy!
234. The sponge heads come off almost right away. They are not glued to the plastic well at all.  You go through 5 heads when you normally would go through one.
235. Arrived quickly and they work.
236. Didn't work for me at all. Returned.
237. Very cheaply made. Definitely not white gold over. The stones looked badly placed as well.
238. States on picture and in details will support up to 360lbs. However upon arrival stickers on scooter and written in instruction manual says supports up to ONLY 300lbs. Made cheaply.
239. Great quality!
240. Bought these to help my five year old improve his brushing. We used a half tab and it completely filled his mouth with purple stain. He said the taste was awful so I tried the other half and it's pretty gross. I would give zero stars if possible because it didn't work at all.

242. These are great! Smell wonderful!  Got them as gifts for friends at Xmas.  They loved them.
243. Cute gift for the Halloween lover!
244. Exstreamly cheaply made
245. No body wants to receive something dirty or broken for something this personal. It has a strong oder and the hole at the top isn't even big enough for the tip for a proper seal. I have terrible bowel problems and I'm constantly having to buy 95 cent enemas and Honestly they are better than this.
246. Doesn’t work as well as sonic care
247. Love this product! I buy it for myself and always keep a supply for my arthritic mother! So soothing and works wonders on achy muscles!
248. Decent and smells nice and faint, but doesn't get poop stains all the way out.
249. Bought this for my neighbor, and she loves it!
250. Buying bug spray for a toddler is not easy. Which ingredients are safe? Will it work if it is deed free? Is it easy to useapply?Yes, yes and yes. I love the UV protection.
251. My first Wen product and I see a big improvement in my hair! It smells great and leaves hair manageable and looking full and healthy. I will definitely be a return customer. My hair dresser sees a difference. He says his customers that use Wen have longer lasting color.
252. My 11 year was diagnosed with Sever's disease and these have worked so well to ease his heel pain. He has a pair in his regular sneakers and a pair in his tennis shoes. They have made a huge difference. I highly recommend for anyone who's child has the same issue.
253. My family loves this game! We always can squeeze in one or two games after dinner and before bed. My 8 and 5 year old boys think it is so fun! A great game that is entertaining for both kids and adults.
254. We purchased this for our baby's room. We already had one for our own bedroom and loved it. Totally drowns out the sounds of life outside the window and allows for a deeper sleep.Our baby now associates the noise machine with sleeping and her eyelids start drooping the moment we turn it on.Four stars because it does seem that the noise gets softermuffled after a few months of use. I thought maybe this was just me going deaf, but I don't think so. The new one we got for the baby is definitely louder than our old workhorse. I also think the holes in the machine that are supposed to allow you to vary the volume of sound don't really do enough. There is a noticeable difference in volume but not enough range.Updated review February 2017: One of our machines has developed a truly irritating rattle. It took a couple days of terrible sleep before I figured it out. Like another reviewer mentioned, it seems better if the machine is on an angle, but the rattle is so unpredictable. I'm ordering a replacement and hoping this is just the result of years of nightly use and not some sort of manufacturing quality issue. Our device and the newer one we got for our daughter are identical and we've moved them around enough that we don't know which was the original anymore.
255. Purchased this twice & each time it came leaking and sticky everywhere. Had to throw it away twice, as I was non usable.
256. I have ordered these supplements several times.  They always come quickly and are a very easily absorbed calcium with other trace minerals.
257. The bristles only extend about halfway up my teeth.  My teeth were not clean after using this. It's in the trash already.
258. I have found these to be really great at taking advantage of all the health benefits of coconut oil. I am not a huge coconut oil fan taste wise, but these are just fine and I can take them no problem. I do find at three pills a time that it is a bit much to take especially with the pills being big. I noticed a little bit of an energy boost so far, but that's about it. I just really like that I can safety take it while breastfeeding and it can still help me lose the baby weight.
259. I got this as a gift for my nephew who is struggling with depression and medical problems. The black tourmaline is perfect to cleanse his space of negative energy and will promote healing. He loved it and really enjoyed spreading out the branches and leaves to his liking. This is a great gift and the black tourmaline is beautiful.
260. Honestly? I was skeptical about the quality- but I am very pleased with the look and heavy feel of these plates. They looked so good and fit my rose gold theme perfectly. These held up to pizza, Mexican dip (which is heavy) and a heavy dense cake.
261. This is useful and seems durable. It's replacing a similar cane I bought a year ago, which bent, but that was a different design for the leg and seemed less durable. I hope this one will last. I use a different cane in the summer but find it useful to have a light on the cane in the winter when I have to see ice and snow to walk. The flashing red light is very useful for crossing the street at night. The alarm might not seem like a great idea but let's be honest; there are people who attack cripples and I ended up needing the alarm only 2 days after I got the cane when I was randomly attacked near my home.I get a lot of compliments on it from people who are impressed with the idea of a cane with lights built in.
262. I find it very useful. People who notice it say really nice things about it, which makes me feel good because they're noticing that my cane is cool instead of that I'm a cripple who needs a cane. And rather to my surprise, two days after I got it I was attacked on the street, so I needed the alarm.On the downside, I find I accidentally turn on the light a little too often, I have accidentally made the batteries fall out (When I was at Disney World, and needed them), and a couple times I have accidentally turned on the alarm (also while I was at Disney World, in a crowded room - and boy did people stare). But I can't really expect it to be harder to activate or it wouldn't be useful, and a cripple doesn't want the battery compartment to be too difficult to open, right? Also, it's *slightly* bent after a few months of use, so it's not holding the weight of a normal person as well as I might like. But I can afford to buy another one if it only lasts a year, so I'm not too upset.
263. I bought this to catch the few stray hairs missed by several rounds of laser hair removal on my legs. The epilator requires multiple passes on some patches. I feel it pulling, but it doesn't get everything. I haven't used an epilator since the 1980s so I'm not sure if this is how they all are or if this one is weak. In any case, having the electric razor option is nice for the few I can't get. I have also tried the heel sander on my feet. Seems okay, but I didn't buy it for that.
264. My wife liked them ok.
265. These work great!  I love that I don't have to mix my shakes before going to the gym... they just taste funny if they've been sitting for awhile.  These are great sizes (more than enough room in each for any dose) and they clean easily.  Obviously; it doubles as a funnel so I'm not spilling powder all over.  I do kinda wish the lower opening was wider... but whatever.  Great product.  I've had several friends ask how to get some for themselves
266. Needed these for a state fair project and they were perfect!
267. I really liked the description of these and also the reviews that said they blocked all noise. Well, not for me. I read the directions and followed them to a T. The earplugs would not stay in my ears no matter how long I held them so they could "reinflate". It was a waste of money for me.
268. Last minute gift for a 15 year old hockey fan. Arrived on time & he appeared happy. Can't comment on the game as we did not play.
269. READ REVIEWS ON THIS FOR 1 WEEK ON YOUTUBE AND WHEN I TELL U....MY STOOLS ARE GREAT. NO ISSUES. NO STOMACH ISSUES MAKES U FEEL GREAT. THIS PRODUCT IS ALSO GOOD FOR PPL WHO MIGHT HAVE HPV. JUST FYI. IT HELPS CLEARS IT.
270. NO ISSUES WORKS GREAT I GUESS
271. Disappointing that only 10 of the 20 pieces I received have an opening large enough for 30mm cabochons.  If you order these, make sure you have smaller cabochons on hand as well.Otherwise, this is a nice product.
272. This did things to an old rug I thought not remotely possible - including not animal related spots!  I extremely highly recommend,
273. I bought this for my granddaughter and my daughter gets stopped all the time asked where she got it!  I fits her well and she looks darling in it!
274. Too firm.
275. perfect for my nature art supply themed Easter baskets! focusing on activities for kids during our corona home stay :)
276. Very few bags of this size, from my experience, have drawstrings, which is exactly why I bought it. And, it's very durable, as well.
277. &#34;Exfoliating&#34;? The scrub pad is far too smooth for a satisfying scrub and I can hear stitching ripping as I attempt to &#34;exfoliate&#34; - give this another week or so before dissolution. The sizelength of the scrubber is perfect however.
278. This pill box is pretty big, but it has to be to hold 31 days of medication.  The daily  pill containers are not huge, but the individual compartments will hold the six pills I take once a day, and few pills two more times a day.  The pill splitter is a nice addition also.  My wife is traveling for a month and she was worried I wouldn't take the right medicine while she was gone.  Now she can fill this pill box up for a month.  It's just he right pill box for my situation.  Glad I found it on Amazon, I was going to buy several small pill boxes.  The quality is good enough and should last a few years.
279. I think this is the best bath Brush I've ever owned!!!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!!!
280. Simple: Wash, apply, sleep on it. Depending on one's body chemistry,  you' ve got yourselfa couple of days to perhaps a week of freedom from deodorant application. This stuff isthe cat's meow! Thanks Lavilin.
281. Being in an office environment, it is often stuffy, can cause your nose to bleed, etc. I think this is a great product to relieve the problem of being stuck in a tight office environment where fresh air is not possible bc you can't open a window. I use it in my office when necessary.
282. So I had been buying the primal life dirty mouth tooth powder and was loving it except the price was gouging me. So I went on the hunt for a more affordable tooth powder option. I stumbled upon this for half the price and decided to give it a go. In terms of tooth cleanliness it probably works about the same? Ya about the same however, it sucks every single last drop of moisture out of your mouth the second it hits it. The mint is also not very strong at all. It in no way helps freshen my breath and my husband and I have started having to use mouth wash which IMO defeats the purpose of going chemical free. Also, because it does suck moisture out I’ve found that chunks of it get stuck to my teeth or gums and I have to do a clean run through of my toothbrush with just water on it to get this off. Just swigging with water won’t do it. We’ve hand this over a month and still have over half the jar left so honestly it’s a good amount of product for what you pay...I’m still on the fence though if I’m gonna reorder this or go back to the primal life toothe powder....
283. This has done wonders in helping to heal my babies dry eczema prone skin! I alternate between this and mustella for eczema prone skin and now her skin is super soft and supple. No more dry flakey patches. Mustella in the morning this at night. So glad I found something that works finally!
284. I was really excited to get this for my husband but the power button does not work. It only turns on if I push the speed button... but since that turns it on, I cant change the speed... if my husband tries to put any pressure on it (lay his neck on it) it just shuts off! Very disappointed...
285. SELLING CARRIER OIL WITH MAYBE A DROP OR TWO OF THE NAMED OIL. I purchased a three bottle set in a department store, does not have any aroma whatsoever!!!
286. Well - I plugged it in, it spins up a small fan (low humming sound), and the internal UV light works.I assume it's working and killing off bad bacteria.  We'll see how it works over time.
287. My husband loves camay and I found this is a great way to purchase it.  The soap came wrapped well and in great time.  I would buy again!
288. I purchased this jewelry organizer as a gift for my mom who travels a lot by plane and had been transporting her poor jewelry in plastic bags.  She and I are both happier now that she has this case!My mom is a no-nonsense sort of gal, so I knew that any organizer I tried to get her to use would need to be extremely functional.  This one is!  Only a few steps to get jewelry in or out and everything has traveled safely in it!The size of the organizer is nice too.  A week's worth of jewelry easily fits inside and the whole case is small enough to go safely in a carry-on (my mom and I never puts our jewelry in checked baggage).I think I'll get one for myself too!
289. These Sanyos are the most consistently performing rechargeables on the market.  Fast cycle recharge (I use a digital Maha), hold a charge when lying idle for many months, and have a discharge life almost as long as an alkaline (maybe 80% as long, by non-scientific observation).  Not cheap, but you'll love them if you have a digital charger.
290. Description says 4pairs, but only 4pcs =2pairs in package, feel cheated，returned. And found 4pairs with the similar price from other seller.
291. My daughter is a soccer champ in her own right but Megan is her favorite. She loves it. (I do wish they came with a simple stand…)
292. Product was supposed to include 4 rubber feet. Mine only came with one
293. This is my third main warmer. I love it and it’s worth the money.
294. Love it!! It works!!! No bug bites or sunburns plus no Icky bug spray smell. I use it on my 8 month old, and no rash or reactions.
295. Absolutely horrible. These are like cheap thin mylar. Disposable; one use only. They can't be reused. They were so frustrating to wrap up (much worse than real Christmas presents). You have to assemble them. They lose air fast!
296. Decent. It's fish oil, how great can it be. Lemon is a nice touch though.
297. Doesn’t do a great job brushing your teeth. I’ve used an electric toothbrush for years. Your teeth don’t feel really clean after using this. The WaterPik attachment  isn’t  great doesn’t seem to have enough pressure. Wish I would’ve just spent more money and bought the WaterPik toothbrush combination.
298. Although it takes a few to get any kind of lather or soap feeling, they were nice to have on our trip because they were light and there was no chance of them spilling. Washed socks and undies.
299. Not sure after using it only one time so far
300. One of the better variety of Balance bars varieties. Super yummy, CANDY BAR LIKE! I almost wish I had never even found or tried these because they are almost too good.
301. Great seller. We had an issue, no fault of the seller's, but they still fixed it for us! The vitamin E oil is great. I use it on my face at night after I shower. Love it.
302. Previously purchased
303. We've had one for a few years and bought a second to give as a gift, love the packaging and color choice!
304. My husband perspires easily. He used the wax, but shortly after it dissolved in the wax. Others may have better results.
305. I threw these away almost as soon as I opened them up.  Way too short!  Didn'tt fit at all.
306. Great glasses! Nice style!
307. Don’t Think I actually need this . Wanted it but I notice I hardly use it. Quality is great though!!!
308.  PROS: Compact, work well, come with bag and coversCONS: none
309. I felt a little mixed about this foot peel at first.  Nothing happened for about 4 days.  No peeling.  Then after a shower on about the 4th day my feet started peeling like crazy for about 4 more days.  In my ignorance I did this prior to an outing which required my bare feet to not look diseased so I scrubbed them like crazy w one of those cheese grater things. Even after that they were STILL peeling.  I would just say, use this with some caution.  You DO NOT want to use this right before a beach vacation.  If you do it 2 to 3 weeks before you want your feet looking good then you should be fine.
310. The two buttons are not enough. I needed 3 buttons on each flap side in order to secure it. For both my toddler and newborn.
311. The beautiful aroma of roses stays on your mat- faintly, not overwhelming. Very easy to use, spray on cloth, wipe it down, let it dry.  All natural, which I love, and will not harm your mat!  A great product for your cherished Yoga mat  I would highly recommend this product.
312. I found this silver ion deodorant at Wal-Mart a couple of years ago but they stopped selling it so I looked everywhere else and could not find it.  In a fit of desperation, I looked on Amazon, and there it was.  I love the deodorant because I understand how silver ion technology works to stop bacterial growth.  When I first saw it, I knew it was going to work very well.  It works exceptionally well.  It actually works the often promised but seldom delivered - two days!  This is the type of deodorant I will use from now on if I can find it.  You should never use anti-perspirant and always only use a deodorant.  The reason is that anti-perspirant contains aluminum and it is a heavy metal that gets absorbed under your arm and is deposited in the fat cells of your brain where it remains for the rest of your life.  Doctors are beginning to understand that this heavy metal accumulation, along with mercury and lead, can contribute to the development and onset of Alzheimer’s disease.

314. Second one. This time is for my friend. Perfect product!
315. Easy to carry. And works perfectly.
316. I don't understand how anybody could like this oil. It smells exactly like house paint. I expected earthy, herbal chamomile and got house paint. Had a couple of other people sanity check my nose - they both agreed it smelled like nothing but paint fumes. No idea.
317. as expected fresh product date perfect
318. I don't like perfume in my skin cream ,and this reminds me of my grandmother's perfume from the 60's!As soon as I put it on my face I had to wash it off within ten minutes because I got a severe headache within minutes after putting it on.For anyone with allergies to fragrances,  (especially horrible ones)beware!!My mistake for not reading the label and thinking it had all natural ingredients which it doesn't--however, it would have gone back with the frangrance anyway.I will stick to my tried and true Jasons...thats what happens when you try and save!
319. Barley Max has a pretty good taste but when they added the mint I couldn't hardly drink it.  It has a sweet taste.  It just doesn't work.  I will continue to get Barley Max without the additional ingredients.I will say that this is an excellent product for adding greens to the diet.
320. The wide mouth of the container makes getting a spoonful of syrup super easy, and the consistency isn't thick or too runny, so this is by far the most convenient yacon syrup purchase I've made. Everything else was great too, the flavor, shipping time, packaging, etc. But the main thing is I can quickly and cleanly get a spoonful out and get on with my day. So this is the one I will put on re-order. Thank you!
321. Nice product - but beware that cornstarch can cause fungal growth, yet breathing and applying talc has a whole other set of problems.
322. great product and Multiple Uses! Great on beards & use one for dog massage and hair removal
323. Good shampoo-it relatively safe for human use because it is  %organic.  Nice scent.
324. I am very happy with the product and the seller services.  I have used this Vita-C serum mixed with my Clinique moisturizer for several years.  It is GREAT to see it available on Amazon with quick shipping. Thank you.
325. The only sturdy travel transparent case out there..
326. I try to do what I can for the environment, so I love this brand. I brought them with me to serve my specialty cocktails in for 4th of July and was feeling a lot better than if they were a Solo cup.
327. Nice color and works well.
328. Nothing is listed on this product that it comes from China till you make your purchase. This is a China Product. I believe AMAZON has the responsibility to let the buyers know why here products are coming from!!!!
329. Great product.  Great service.
330. I bought this bag to create a trauma kit specifically designed for treating gunshot wounds (civilian living in area with frequent gangpolice shootings and minimum of 15-20 minutes until medical attention, assuming you carry victim and drive them to hospital, as paramedic help would take hours to arrive). I could not find a pre-packaged trauma kit with the supplies essential for providing care in this situation, so I read quite a bit and made my own. This bag was the perfect size to house the supplies.To give an idea of what fits in the bag, I've included how I packaged it (see pictures as well):Left pocket: Large supply of latex-free gloves and extra ziploc bagsRight pocket: severe trauma items (Celox granules with applicator for internal bleedinggunshot wound, Israeli bandage, and tourniquet)Central pocket: Celox granule packets, headlamp, shears, CPR face shields, emergency blanket, 2x3 non-stick pads, 4x4 gauze pads, compression bandages, gauze rolls, medical tape, 5x9 trauma pads, tampons (to stuff gunshot wounds), HyFin Vent chest seals (2 - for entry and exit wound), and petroleum jelly (in case of multiple sucking chest wounds at same time, can be used with gauze pads taping 3 sides to allow air out and prevent from entering)I also purchased the MegaMover 1500 portable transport unit due to being in a setting where the victim would need to be carried a significant distance to reach the nearest road. It does not fit in the kit, but we store them together. Thankfully, we have not had to use anything since making the kit, but after someone died last year due to delayed medical attention after being shot by police, we felt it was essential to have a kit that could save someone's life during those ~20 minutes before a professional can take over.In addition to being the right size for a trauma kit, another plus of the bag is that it has the universal medical symbol on it - something that signals to police and gang members alike that you are there to provide medical aid and do not pose a threat.
331. Used this to make my vanilla! LOVE THIS STUFF! Best vanilla ever! Would buy again!
332. Good product.  Gets my little girl to floss and brush her teeth.  My only issue is that I think it is a bit pricey
333. I love this natural deodorant! No rash, no musty smells, and no worries! I'm new to this but my guy has been using it for awhile and swears by it and has gotten me on it too! Adrinathevegan approved!
334. Not good for my homemade cosmetics — compared to other organic grapeseed oils, this one is deep yellowish green in color with a very pungent almost sour smell. I had previously been using a different grapeseed oil that was near odorless and had only a very faint pale yellow color.
335. These cards are beautiful inside and out and contain verses from the King James Version of the Bible which is what I wanted.
336. Love it! Perfect for the AM thermogenic and protein!
337. This snack is really delicious and it’s packed full of energy
338. I purchased this product to use under Leukotape at the recommendation of my physical therapist. I've used it on my knees, feet, and back, and found it to be tremendously helpful in supporting my joints and relieving pain.
339. I could not get past the taste of these supplements. I can't really comment on how well they work because they tasted so bad that I couldn't keep them down. If I need these again, I will not purchase this brand.
340. The yellow shelf fell apart in my hand as I was trying to install it.  As I tightened the wingnut, it unscrewed itself from the wood.  I'll need to get some glue and see if that will fix it.
341. Bought this for my 88 year old mom who couldn't read her old scale. Super easy for her to use and read - the numbers are HUGE!
342. as described - recommended seller
343. The product is exactly as described.  It is perfect for the size of my hand and the right amount of sponge to give me the results i am looking for.
344. Doesn't make sense. This product is perfect for vegetarians and they would make more money if they didn't use gelatin capsules. (cause more people could buy it)
345. Did work for me. I cannot wear backpacks because they hurt my shoulders and this was like wearing a backpack. Very uncomfortable for me.
346. Great product and I would imagine this &#34;sponge&#34; lasts a long time.  No wasted makeup. Spreads foundation evenly. So glad I got it as now I feel like my make up is fresh and not mixed with old dried out makeup still in the sponge. Saves on foundation too as there's almost nothing left behind. Can be rinsed off so fresh with each use. Great idea!!!!
347. Seller is advertising product as easy to swallow. They are NOT. These capsules are almost an inch long and about 1.25 inches in circumference. They are among the largest, if not the largest, capsules I have come across so I measured them. Many older people have trouble swallowing and these could very well be dangerous for them. I have a smallish throat so I bought these believing the &#34;easy to swallow&#34; advertising, which I find deceiving. Will not purchase again.
348. The product you get comes in three syringes. You apply 1ml to a spoon and eat the gel. It's fussy, and kind of weirdly flavored. The whole syringe thing is weird. It is best refrigerated after you open each syringe. Yes, I believe it is a good product and effective! However, the delivery system is really most suitable for people who have syringe fetishes and a lot of time on their hands. I'd much prefer to have had the product in a softgel.
349. All of the ingredients in this combination are well thought out and researched, and patented, potent forms of them are included. There is no magnesium stearate, etc. in the capsules. I find that this combination helps keep me focused and yet less stressed. Sometimes i take in the evening but it's equally good in the morning. The cost is relatively high for 2 capsuleday use but during a particularly stressful period it is worth it. I find taking 1day works for me, but my body weight is not much over 100#.
350. This has a really good lemonlime Mountain Dew Baja Blast flavor.  it mixes well and does what it needs to do! I The tub is very small! I didn't realize that it was a sample size. So the price isn't as attractive as it seems.  Other than that complaint, I can recommend it. Isn't too sweet, and definitely works.
351. I really like using acacia senegal for gut health, and this is a high quality product. Easy to add to any beverage or protein powder mix. Try it!
352. This is a great way to get zinc, which has so many valuable properties for health. Just a few good tasting drops per day of this readily absorbed form and you're good to go. One less capsule or tablet to take. Good value.
353. There have been a plethora of supplements available on amazon that are clearly manufactured in China, with laughable Chinglish ad copy and over the top photos of usually blonde people having a great time. Some of them are downright poor quality, while others seem to be produced with more care and integrity. This falls in the latter category. An inscrutable part of the ad copy states: "Compare to physician formulated seeking health." There is a claim to check out their awards in the photo section, which reveals nothing more than badges stating things like "non-GMO" (without mentioning any of the governing bodies that regulate or oversee such claims), "100% guarantee," etc. It states the product is manufactured for a company in Florida.  There are 10 different commonly used strains; the capsules are on the larger size considering the dosage (10 B CFU). There is no indication that the product was designed to withstand stomach acid and deliver the full dosage to the gut, but is seems to work as expected. However, I take probiotics daily and have no major issues. If you suffer from IBS, frequent candida, or other serious issues, you might be better off with a more well researched combination from a reputable and well known company, but for ogeneral use this seems a decent choice.
354. These are great glasses to stash around the house because almost everyone can wear them, and 1.50 can help almost everyone but are not too strong. It's fun to have three different color frames, in color-coordinated snug fitting protective cases. The frames are lightweight and comfortable. I don't expect them to survive being sat upon, for instance; the plastic feels like it would snap. But they seem like they are durable. I find that they are best for reading a book, or a computer, where you are not moving your head very much, because the focal point is fairly specific. Once you turn your head a little bit, the focal point changes. More expensive glasses don't seem to do this. All in all, they are great for an emergency or -- for instance -- in the bathroom in case you need to read some fine print on a medication bottle, etc.
355. Ziploc bags are, in my opinion, the most reliable. These bags are the same as the plain ones in the store, but with a large Green Bay Packers logo on one side. You can see what is in the bag on the backside. If you are a Packers fan, these will cheer you up. The logo is easy to ignore if you don't care about football! Gallon size is perfect for so many things!
356. Love this!
357. Gave me a bad headache after about 3 nights of usage
358. This is effective for bad breath, especially for people with SIBO with Hydrogen Sulfide back up (smells like rotten eggs) it makes the bad breath go away for 1 day... I use 5 of the scoops that it came with per serving.
359. Excellent product. I noticed a long time ago that Sauerkraut puts me in a good mood.. and later read somewhere that there are certain probiotics that when they reach the gut they can produce certain neurotransmitters and if the person lacks them (not everyone) it will help their mood.Anyways, the reason i gave it a 3 star is because of the price.... I mean WTH? i expect to get it cheaper on amazon not more expensive! I buy this same bottle for $6.49 at the Sprouts Market! ... Frankly if I have to buy it for $11 i just buy some containers of Sauerkraut and drain and drink the juice and it will be cheaper... I go through a bottle of this every 3 days.
360. I take it with meals (especially ones that are heavy in fat) and it helps with digestion... I used to get bloated and my motility (bowel movements) would be slow.. but taking this product along with my main meals gets ride of the bloating... also I feel a little more energy  in a sense that since I am not bloated all the time, I have an easier time to move around and be active...
361. Very nice dispenser and I keep it in my kitchen because it is a much more economical way to keep and use paper towels .
362. I use for nights not for industrial work.  For sleeping they are small, soft,gentle pressure.  Large ear holes and loud environs-? plus a usable mask.
363. Not too hot, supportive medium stretch and compression.
364. As you can see by my pic that the wrap only wraps the neck.  I was hoping it would come around the shoulders as pictured, but it doesn’t.  It’s very nice for the neck though.  The velcro on the cover is extremely strong and gets stuck on other parts of the wrap if you are not careful when opening it, not a big deal, just tricky.  I like that it does Velcro fasten around the neck, no slipping off.  It stays warm longer than the one I currently have which is a huge plus.  I would give this a 9 for sure, only because I wish it came down more around back at the trap and top of shoulder, I have a pinched nerve there!
365. I have nasal issues, and like my mother, boxes of tissue in every room and car.  I don’t have cup holders in my car, but these would work perfectly there.  They are not super soft and thick but not thin and rough either, so they’re fine.  My only recommendation is to look at the diagram on Amazon on how to open it up, I didn’t and ripped off the top, I taped it back together tougher and the canister works great, one coming out after one is pulled up and out very easily.
366. I took off one star due to the cotton wrapping around each earplug. It was very hard to get off, it took a while for just one.  I just found out why:  It was very HOT yesterday, I opened one this morning only 70 in here now and the cotton came right off. I added a star back on to 5.  The cotton is not a problem.  I think the reason noted in packaging for the cotton was not to use plastic? More earth friendly? However, there was no need to wrap these in anything.  I use Macks, they come open in a row, they are a different material, but same could have been done with these.  I finally unwrapped one and it fit and molded into my ear nicely.
367. Baggy, didn't fit properly, middle finger was tiny, which is your longest finger.  Sent back
368. Best product on the market for cleaning!  I am so glad I discovered these.  I use them to clean my tile floor, bathtub, refrigerator, counter tops etc.  They clean so well you don't really need to use much cleaning solution. If you haven't tried these, you should.
369. I ordered this for my furbaby, as water through a dropper, is the only way he will drink water. Droppers alone,  are really hard to find in stores around here. Usually the dispenser for giving meds to kids is included in package and the price is higher than here at Amazon. So far it serves the purpose  for which I purchased it. Also I found a small brush that fits into the dropper for thorough cleaning. Well worth the purchase.
370. This was from the second or third batch we purchased.  They work so well and are actually so comfortable we've occasionally forgotten to take them off!
371. Never again! Totally ruined our mattress, even though I added more elastic to the straps, it is now very uneven and indented where the mat was placed. Constantly shocked me. So much happier now that we took it off. Had it on for 2 years...never again!!
372. these are so low quality, the broke in pieces right after I put them on, leaving me with just nails in my shoes
373. Excellent traction device.  Very helpful.  Good quality materials.
374. It works!  Easy to apply, doesn't damage fabric.  Disposable is very convenient.
375. They do the trick.
376. Gets rid of the bulk before i straighten it :) Much better than the first one I bought.. it didnt work at all... and those people sent me a faulty product. But with this i got what i expected. I have super thick curly hair btw.
377. These are perfect for home manicures.
378. Doesn’t stay on, falls constantly while using. Dangerous. I only weigh 135 lbs and I can’t rest my foot on it. DO NOT BUY
379. These are well flavored drops.  I used it for vape juice flavoring and my husband enjoyed the flavor and had no complaints.
380. I really like this product but it is a bit pricy for us and that is the only reason for the 4 star.  Do recommend!!
381. As many of you know, elephant exchanges can get intense. This product right here kept everyone on their toes to get it. Awesome gift.
382. Discreet packaging, padded envelope that makes it appear as tools.Heads up, if it gets hard to blow through, it's from overuse and it just needs to dry off
383. Very good quality fish oil. I use it myself and give it to my kids too.
384. We love this scale! It was quite expensive but being that a scale lasts a long time i think it was worth it.
385. I really like the taste ...freshens the mouth and gums and I see my gums are pinkish as opposed to red ...Definitely does something! Thank you Vitalina!
386. i really like this stuff .it makes my skin feel smooth ...and fine lines seem to disappear
387. Very nice bath brushes!
388. I started stocking up on THM products several months ago so by New Year's day, I would be able to start switching my diet and lifestyle over to THM completely.This sweetener is a perfect blend for a super sweet mix.  It's perfect for all of your baking needs.  This is one of those items I will never let myself run out of.It's also pure, and much better for you than sugar or artificial sweeteners.  There is nothing artificial about this pure product!  I highly recommend it!
389. Awesome cause I can stomache drinking apple cider vinager
390. This is the best ever no lies to any caps to used Amen
391. I'm thinking that this thing would've been bigger than that tiny thing (i've gotten in my mailed box SMH) but guessed wrong SMH I've had kept my money I used it once and didn't have my skin feeling flawless right so I'm better than using my hands instead of using this seriously OMG when I washed my face with my hands it feels super flawless soft and also right with the face washed I gotten from the store makes it's super flawless soft and cleaned as ever hands down seriously!!!!!? God bless
392. These are soft and really makes you feel good even when scrubbing hard, I will say it's cheaper to buy them in the store though
393. I have had this item for a year. It is the perfect firmness for the brushes. I get that great tingling feeling of blood rushing before I jump in the shower. I spray it with rubbing alcoholvinegar mix to keep it clean and keep it under my bathroom sink. I like that the head doesn’t detach and I can do my dry brushing in 5min. Super easy and well made!
394. I love this Juul skin but it’s already peeling off and I’ve only had it a couple of days. But otherwise it’s perfect!!!
395. they break easily. i keep getting packs that have bulbs with exposed wires and detached bases. other than that, they work really well. perfect daylight balanced bulbs, very bright. I replaced my entire house with these bulbs and surprisingly my utilities bill decreased
396. I've used many different whitening pens and decided to try this product. I liked it better than most because of the thickness of gel.  But after just a week the tip came off, I put it back on but realized it was empty.  I was like..what?...I used it the same as any of the others I have purchased and this ran out much faster.  Likely I bought two so I had a backup but unless the amount of gel in the product changes I will not repurchase.
397. And have loved it for years!! I keep this in the shower and when I am done, before toweling dry, I spray it all over. Esp on elbows, knees & feet. Then I towel dry.  Sometimes I'll spray a lil on my body when dry if I'm going for that soft, sexy, not too shiney look ;)  Awesome Product! Highly recommend!!
398. I like this product. It does the job. I just don’t like how if you don’t wipe it totally off, there’s pink residue that sits on your things. I mean, unless you know it’s cleaner, it ends up looking gross. Maybe I just need to do a better job cleaning? I’m not sure.
399. Does the job.
400. Because I cannot take such large capsules, I have to open them up and mix with juice. This tastes pretty good compared to most. So far so good!
401. Did not make any difference for me
402. Don’t waste your money. Just buy some apple cider vinegar, it works much better.
403. Package was a little beat, but colognes were intact.
404. It worked great for a month and then one day the bottom leg fell off and now won't work and themed won't go back on....
405. This is A lot more practical than I expected it to be. Great reminder
406. Great stick! Just don't forget that you put it on when you need to utilize the water closet
407. Wonderful product at a great price.  I've been on prescription sleep aids for years and this product combined with Liftmode's 5-htp, and over-the-counter Ateril has allowed me to fall asleep naturally for the first time in years.  I love the purity of the product,(and the little measuring spoon that comes with it).  Will definitely be buying more.  Thank you so much.
408. It makes a little product go a LONG way.  Very easy to clean.  I usually use makeup brushes for my daily application but I received this as a gift and wanted to see what all the internet hype was about.  I watched A LOT of tutorials online before using it for the first time. There were a lot of mixed reviews on it: some loved it but others hated it. It takes longer to blend than my brushes but the finish is amazing with so little product being used! One potential improvement I would recommend is making the ends smaller so that it is easier getting into areas such as underneath and in the inner corner of my eyes and around my brows.
409. These are nice files for the price. They file well, leave nails feeling smooth, and they're WASHABLE! I've had them a few months now and my file hasn't dulled or lost strength. Excellent purchase!
410. Received Selenite Generator on time and it was more that I expected. I would recommend this Generator.
411. I like this product.I recommended 100% percent.Really works
412. They look good. Are totally transparent. Don't have a good coverage for my  eyelids though ( age related). I tried several strips. I followed the instructions. After about 2 hours they dried out and peeled off
413. I am almost 50 and have noticed my focus and concentration on the decline. I noticed a tremendous difference on the 2 dose 2 day!I was able to stay focused on a project for over 10 overs with distraction.I am beginning to feel like my younger self!
414. I chose the "Sweet" over the "Savory" based upon the vegetables I like more, but I didn't care for the taste of this.  It changed the flavor of any food I added it to, so it's still sitting on my counter over a month later.
415. Nice and heavy duty. Was perfect
416. It helps take some pressure off my back...The only reason why I have 3 stars is because I can't sit with this belt for more than 15 or it starts to give me cramps and allot of pressure on my stomach ...So Everytime you sit down you have to take it off, that's the only bad thing
417. I love this stuff.  I have a low thyroid and use this all the time to stay &#34;regular&#34;.  It does taste a bit chalky if you don't mix with something.  I put in my morning smoothie and blend it in and it works great.
418. Not sure if it deserves 3 stars...But I’ll keep using it to give it two out of three tries.
419. Great for those bitterly cold nights when cold feet won't allow you to fall asleep.  Runs a little tight.  It does its job.  Don't try to walk in it.
420. Smells so clean. Not a strong smell.  I'll buy more of this. I love it.
421. Cute packaging and I like the scooper because it makes it really easy to fill my water bottles. This cherry flavor is really off. It has a weird aftertaste that's sort of plasticky.I drink caffeine powder mixes daily and this wasn't what I expected. It didn't smell weird to me like another person commented but the flavor isn't good at all.  The other flavors might be better.
422. I have a smallish face and these still fit me. I like that there's basically 3 layers if you count the pouch for the filter.The only thing I don't like about this mask is I don't feel like it seals around my face.  I'm going to order those adhesive metal nose strips to see if those would help.  This does not come with a strip in the nose part.This mask seems like it's made well and the ear loops are adjustable to fit most faces.
423. I ordered these because I can usually wear kid size mask and I wanted something that looked less threatening when I run in my neighborhood with a mask on.The adjustable loops fit my ears fine. The mask itself fits fine but it's almost too small and not comfortable enough for running because I feel that it's not going to stay up over my nose.I think this mask is best for preteens or younger. It's well made and the outside layer feels like a tightly weaved cotton fabric. The inside fabric is t-shirtJersey cotton. I can breathe fine with it on despite it feeling pretty thick.The bunny mask bled on the print and now it has a light pinkish discoloration on the white part. All the other mask washed and hung dry fine.
424. A nice change from all those orange flavored vitamin C gummies. I kept thinking these were blueberry flavored but they are supposed to be grape.  I think it could pass for either because the flavor isn't very strong.I love that these are vegan and the cute little gummy bear shapes. You are supposed to take 2 a day.  I've been taking these everyday along with my regular multivitamins. There's only 20mg of vitamin C in each serving but it's an extra boost on the amount I'm already taking, plus there's zinc (3mg) and echinacea (10mg).
425. I love this brand! These came at the perfect time because everyone around me has a cold. These are a lot more gentler on my nose than the weird off brand my company orders.  These don't dry my nose out as bad at the others.I like that these are thick and don't fall apart and the boxes have an appealing design.
426. Love the large size, does the job!
427. I gave this to a friend with thinner thighs and calves. Do not recommend for heavy persons with added bulk in these areas. Sides of tub press uncomfortably against calves or can get only one leg in at a time. My friend wears a size 15 shoe and has ample room for his feet.
428. Been using this for a while now in my smoothies with my vitamix blender. Delicious! Best way to eat them greens
429. Perfect for the office. People love them!
430. Did not have nearly the amount of shoulder correction I was looking for. Provides basic lower back support, same as a wrap support would, and a slight pull-back for the shoulders, but not that much.
431. I got this for my daughter who's almost four years old. We can't find any bigger swim diapers anywhere for her and I'm so glad I found this! She's not potty trained due to disability and I'm glad there's something out there for someone like her so she's able to keep swimming practice since the pool doesn't allow those disposable ones anymore. I'd imagine that there would be many out there who could use these big swim diapers too. I like the basic colors. We can pretty much use this on her with any cute swimsuits over it. Can't even tell that this is underneath her swimsuit! Thank you pool pal!
432. Works great for the Price!!!!! I wash my face with it twice a day gets thru that great...I message my husband forehead & back with it be loves it everything I do, I do it so very gentle...it can not withhold very much pressure...but it 150% works for Sat I got it for at great price!! The stone attachment and other 2 are beyond useless tho wish it had another brush!!!! Anyhow I can't beat that price!
433. I decided to give this product a try alongside my order of AeroShot Energy and based on the reviews from this product, I was actually pretty excited to get the minty-fresh-breath spray combined with the energy boost. I even bought two!EPIC FAIL. Yes, this product will give you a minty blast of breath spray that will temporarily last, however the energy level that I received after even over-usingover-spraying resulted in no more energy than I would have expected. I felt NOTHING but fresh tasting breath and cleared-up airways.I would definitely say, save your money and pass on this Primer Peppermint "ENERGY" Breath Spray. Stick with Altoids.*Note: See my review on AeroShot Energy for a product that actually works!*
434. Lots of boxes of tissue for the price. More than I expected!
435. I like that these are soft packaging. Easy to carry in your car, purse, anywhere. Good value.  Why soft on the skin. Would buy again.
436. I used this stuff for like 3 months and it did absolutely nothing... like nothing at all. I work out regularly and I was pretty sad about it.
437. Helping with tummy issues. Using with Oregano oil, too.
438. I didn’t actually get this since someone stole it from the lobby. But I ha e used these before and it tasted amazing and fruity. I did order it from my husband’s account and it tasted great.
439. Didn't work very well for me I found if my face got warm I had to reapply.
440. I bought this for a partially paralyzed neighbor.  Always good to have around as some days he's stronger on transfers than others.
441. I bought 2 more !  Eventually the lining seperated.  I'm going to see if I can sew it. Lasted a long time before it did that.
442. I've had severe shoulder and arm pain for about 6 months.  This gel eliminated this pain with 2 or 3 applications. WOW!!!
443. I think this is a good fish oil but the two things I don't like are the cholesterol and soy in it as you can find others out there without it.  The cost is high but that is what you get with a good product.
444. Absolutely theeee best eye glass cleaner.  It smells a little strange.  But boy does it work.  How do they figure this stuff out ?
445. :( nozzle won't stay on.
446. I love this combination of kelp and potassium.  I was feeling tired most of the time and after only using it for 2 days, I can feel an increase in my energy level.  Excellent if you use sea salt or a salt with no iodine to replenish the iodine your body needs.
447. I haven't hung these yet but they are beautiful and seem to be well made.  Looking forwrd to hanging them this spring!
448. Product did not work! Do not waste your money!
449. These lip balms contain essential oils. This is not disclosed in the ingredient list in the product description or in the seller's response to a question about ingredients. Those of us with allergies rely on this information being accurate, especially when a product claims to be fragrance-free. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this product when it was misrepresented on Amazon.
450. I go through a LOT of this stain remover. My kids have a dress code at school, and they come home covered in stains from art class, lunch, and the playground. Prior to using this stain remover, I was throwing away clothes because I couldn't get the stains out of them. Sometimes they take a second treatment, but I haven't found anything that this stain remover doesn't get out.
451. My kids wear school uniforms (khakis and polos), and they come home every day with oily black marks all over their clothes from the recycled tire pieces used as a base on their playground. Additionally, they have the normal kid stains: food, paint, dirt, etc. I've never used a stain remover before but figured that would be cheaper than continuing to throw away clothes.This arrived in the mail yesterday, and as luck would have it (haha!), my daughter came home in khakis completely covered in black marks, so I got to test it right away. I followed the directions on the back of the bottle and treated the entire week's worth of uniform clothes (so some stains had had a chance to set in). After one round through the washer, about 90% of the stains were gone. I did a second treatment on a few spots and rewashed everything, and those khakis I would have otherwise thrown out were completely stain-free when I removed them from the washer. There was also a white shirt from earlier in the week that had gotten paint on it in art class, and that came out completely, too. The only stains that didn't come out were a spot that looked like it may have been from a Sharpie and a grass stain; honestly, though, these could have already gone through the laundry once before and set in, so I can't say for sure that this wouldn't have worked on them.I didn't notice this anywhere in the description, but this product does have a slight smell, kind of like baby powder. Also, it leaves a soapy residue on anything you spray it on, and clothes required extra rinses to come clean.Overall, I'm amazed at how this took really tough stains out of clothes, and I am so glad to have found something that will save us from having to constantly replace clothing. Because I went through about two-thirds of a bottle on a single load, I think I'll be buying this at Target from now on since their website has it much cheaper.
452. This product did not make me lose weight, but I have longer nails and thicker hair! I would recommend for the collagen!
453. Another great deal from BS. Great glucosamine powder, great price!
454. This is the 3rd different brand I have tried, and this one stands out.  It's greener, tastes fresher and seems more alive.One small complaint, and it's very small is it's a little hard to get the lumps out. No big deal, really.  I just put about 12 cupcool water in a glass and stir in the barley and wheat grass. I have to smash the lumps against the side of the glass, butthis one tastes so alive....I would not trade it....
455. It did take a long time to ship but I have no complaints.I have never tried Pine pollen before so I have nothing to compare it to.It got here earlier then promised.
456. scratched the heck out of me
457. I use this Make Frappuccino’s 1 teaspoon mixed with a scoop of ice and 6 ounces of cold brew whatever kind you want I like Khalifa brand with almond milk totally delicious perfect Frappuccino way way less sugar
458. Just finished first bottle.  Heart palpitationsfluttertachycardia has lessened some.  Constipation is better.  There could be other factors, but i noticed these changes pretty quickly.  I'm taking one star off because of the plastic bottle, and because there is no dropper included.  The plastic has to go.  I don't know what to make of the claims around &#34;picometer&#34; form and better absorption than any other form.  OTOH, what product is better than this?
459. This is highly reviewed by top cancer doctors and they have well documented case history on this vitamin d. Excellent for getting d up quickly and into your lymph system! TASTE GREAT! My bottle cames sealed and fresh!
460. 1st day had a headache and jaws were clinched.  Waited a few days -(because I wanted focus and memory)- and tried with 12 of a capsule and stayed on that dose for a week without any headache or clinched jaw side effects.  After a week went to 1 full capsule and love the results.  I have so much energy, drive, motivation, focus and ability to remember.  I really think that at 67 I have lost a lot of my &#34;mind&#34;.  With Optimind, I am back like I was in my 20's.  If you think it is expensive, call them and order 6 bottles at a time, it gets the cost down to $25 a bottle.  My husband, who usually just laughs at my supplements, tried one, he takes one daily now.  Both of us love what it does for our mind and energy.  After 3 weeks on them, thought I probably should take a day and rest, well, I did rest, after cleaning out the garage, cleaning my car inside and out, two hours of  shopping and coming home to fix dinner.  Before Optimind, I would open the garage door look at the mess, and close the door - it all seemed like too big of a job. Most supplements are hype, not Optimind.  Not sure why it didn't work for the people that rated it anything less than a 5 unless they are some of the few people that still have their &#34;minds&#34; intact.  I'll gladly give up other things to afford Optimind.  Besides with Optimind, I save money from not paying others to do, what I was too tired to do or couldn't focus or think clearly enough to do.
461. I've been using turkey tail mushroom since 2014 ever since I was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. This brand is really good. Just one a day for the past couple weeks has been great. I don't feel as sluggish and I feel it does a great job protecting my liver.
462. Absolutely love the PowerDot and the wireless, Bluetooth capabilities. As an athlete I can take this anywhere and use it at any time without worrying about having to hold the main component. Its easy to pack, transport and use anywhere. It’s a high quality product that I would recommend to anyone of any level for any reason.
463. My kids and I take this for fibromyalgia (along with a protocol). It has given us back our lives.
464. Too grainy, I had to keep stirring it to keep it from settling so I could drink it....
465. They are a great fit for the lager Shark head attachment which are also harder to find.
466. AWESOME protein powder. LOVE IT! This is one of the best whey products I have used ! The quality is excellent, it tastes fresh and clean. Mix very well in smoothies. I have tried many whey products and this is by far the best I have used. Great marketing job on packaging, customers like me don't care about pretty box but rather a good quality product. Thank you, so happy to have found TRUproteins, will be making it one of our house staple.
467. I purchased these to give a few drops of medication to my dogs orally. I was terrified to use a syringe, but these are individually wrapped and very easy to use. Since I'm using to get into the medicine bottle and only get a few drops out, they work well for what I need. The needles appear thick. The syringe is well made, strong and clearly marked. I cannot speak to accuracy of ml but the plunger worked perfectly.  I searched around for a long time and ultimately decided this was the most economical purchase for my use.
468. I absolutely love Energetix products, especially the homeopathic formulas. I am so sensitive to supplements and foods and it was hard to find something to support my lymph during my healing journey. Lymph III has been amazing. I’m so happy I’ve found their products.
469. I liove this oil! I use it daily on my face. I mix my favorite essential oils in with it. It absorbs quickly and leaves my face so soft. I use a combo of this and pomegranate seed oil. No more expensive day or night creams for me.....and I've gotten compliments on how nice my skin looks,
470. It seems to give me energy about an hour after I drink it. Only downside is it upsets my stomach during that hour. I feel pretty good after that.
471. Warning: This stuff is STRONG. But if you are really really congested, this will do the trick. Make sure you keep it well away from your nose or the burn will be crazy. I use it as a double - 1 for congestion and 2 to keep me awake at work when it gets that bad.
472. I love healthy delights chews. I think they are a healthy alternative to swallowing a pill and they taste good too. Almost as an appetite suppresant. I will always  purchase these chews when I can.
473. Are you kidding me. Wonderful product with great application. Thank you. Will refer clients to you.
474. This was a gift to my niece for her 21st birthday. She loves it. It works perfectly for her traveling needs.
475. This stuff really works. I will not leave home without it
476. Totally happy with it. Met my needs and expectations.
477. The first bag i ordered was bright orange and felt and worked great as a natural vitamin C. The second and third bag i ordered were brown in color with a very different taste and smell. Not consistent and really disappointed in the quality control. Also the color of powder does not match color in product image.But I love terrasoul products so I will buy their camu camu powder nstead which is supposed to have 3x more vitamin C then acerola cherry.
478. This Horsetail extract is potent. I didn't realize that's it would give me energy. And it help relieve some joint and muscle pain within the hour. When I take it, I mix 18 tsp of it in the morning and another 18 tsp at night. Be careful with this stuff it's potent. On my first dose of this I tested with 14 tsp and I was bouncing off the walls.I mix this with the following powders: Nettle Root Extract, Curcumin Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Boswellia, Quercitin Extract, Acerola Cherry, Ashwagandha Extract, and Reishi Extract; which act like a natural anti-inflammatory and pain tonic.I'm also taking this Horsetail to help build strong bones due to the high silica content. Horsetail is a great supplement for strong bones and teeth since silica is what gets converted to calcium in the body. So this way I allow my body to produce natural calcium it needs to build bone.I will be buying more when I run out and look forward to the long term benefits of Horsetail.
479. This one dissolves easy in water, compared to previous Glucosamine that i had gotten from GNC. I was sent a free sample of Glucosamine, and have been taking it for about a week now, and notice a slight difference in my joints and muscles. I have taken Glucosamine previously, and it does take some time to fully get the benefits. So you have to be patient, but you will see results over time. I will be ordering more once i run out. Glucosamine is best taken with Chondroitin.
480. In simple terms they fit my switch and look so cute.
481. The probiotics ingredients aren't mentioned in the bottle I wouldn't purchased this again
482. Marine collagen was better for me
483. Its  smells like my hair is always burning and the plates  don't seem to keep my hair straight  for more then a few hours
484. Great for nails
485. No Santo Remedio. It didn’t work and everything smelled like it. Very strong smell.
486. This the Wright size for everyone
487. I received Cascade Complete as listed in the product description.  Good product.
488. Very effective pain relief patch. I mainly use it on my knees.
489. Nice size, noise level so-so, don't work worth a darn though. Waste of my $$.
490. I filled up the soap container and it was very hard to squeeze it out, so I just put the soap on the brush and showered that way! I like the brush part, soft and felt like it was getting the dry skin off, but didn’t like the fact that the liquid soap was hard to squeeze out, it is okay, but not as easy as it says in the ad..... I bought the three pack so I won’t be buying it again...
491. I received Cascade Complete as listed in the product description.  Good product.
492. This is a sturdy little bag that you can open & close many times
493. Great product quick delivery very satisfied
494. Good product!
495. The way the mask looked as if it was standing up in the picture I thought it was sturdy and possibly had some sort of filter but it doesn’t. It’s a flat piece of fabric across my face and it fits loose with no way of adjusting the ear loops. However it is very soft and comfortable but very much protection as one with a filter would offer.
496. Gentle and effective. My teeth have never been cleaner.
497. i do like the organic extracts in general ,the price of this product was nice packing was great ,no leaks my mom used it and she's happy with it , smells nice and the density of it was nice as she said.
498. i do like the organic extracts in general ,the price of this product was nice packing was great ,no leaks my mom used it and she's happy with it , smells nice and the density of it was nice as she said.
499. They work, they are fine! Why pay for the other brand?
500. The plastic seal was broken. Also, the twist seal on the lid was damaged not on the grooves of the bottle completely, so when I twisted to open it the entire thing came off. This seems to be what caused the oil to leak out in the packaging, about 15 of the bottle. It smelled strongly of lime when I opened the box, so I knew immediately it had leaked. Regarding the scent, it is refreshing and a pleasant lime smell. I would have given this 5 stars if it wouldn't have leaked.
501. My whole family likes these. They have great battery life and make your teeth feel soooo clean!
502. Was very happy with this product and seller. Would buy again.
503. Exactly as expected. I just throw it in the washer when done. Works well on my floors, I recommend these.
504. Shaker cup is decent, will get the job done. Really bought this for the plant based sample shakes. Loved the quality of the shakes and also their flavors. You can't expect much in flavor when it comes to these types of shakes but you will feel great after getting consistent with them!
505. fits better than the knock-offs, but pricey since model is discontinued
506. I was hoping this was the original formula, but it is not. I used this detergent with my last 2 kids so I know the smell of it, and this one is not the same. I loved the old smell, which last longer on the clothes after washing. This one fades away; I can barely smell it after the clothes come out of the washer. Also, the original formula is much more concentrated, therefore you only need to use a little bit. I used more with this one. As for packaging, it arrived well packaged in plastic so there was NO leak.
507. I saw no change with the whitening pen. It does have a pleasant taste. Doesn’t work for me☹️
508. I had one of the Muscle Milks at 3PM in the afternoon and was on the toilet for 2 hours shortly after. I did not have any other things in the day that could have led to this effect that day. Lots of preservatives in the drink.
509. Love love this product!
510. I thought the idea of using special detergent for my baby was ridiculous. I had some clothes I had to hand wash and decided to just use the samples of Dreft I got from Amazon in my registry gift box. Immediately I thought, “oh, this smells so good.” And then my husband came downstairs and said, “what’s that baby smell? It smells really good!” I read reviews and it seems the scent changed over the years. While I can’t speak to the old scent, the new one is a light powdery scent. It smells similar to the Johnson & Johnson original baby lotion. I’m excited to wash all my newborn’s clothes in this stuff!
511. Cooking and refreshing. Isn’t the most absorbent, but it is a liner and not a full pad. I love these. They tend to help relive my cramps to some extent.
512. O.k, so it's been 3 weeks and 4 days since I've been taking these breast pills. I am seeing a difference but not in cup size, I'm seeingfeeling a lot of firmness and more bounce.when I touch my boobs they fill like they got bigger but when I look at my before picture I don't see a difference in size but just straight firmness. I don't know, but I will purchase one more bottle and see if I see a difference. I mean if you want results you have to commit on taking them every day.I will for sure reveal the truth  to as if this product works.One thing I do hate are scammers. I will be your proof.All I know is that if this s*** don't work in a month I want my money back. Look for Luz Zuniga for me to keep you updated.
513. Obviously they aren't named brand heads. They are generic brand from another country. They are much softer and I'm not sure how long they will last.  Doubt I will buy again. They did fit my Clarsonic Mia just fine though. So no issue there.
514. Cannot use. Too hard to spray. Would have to use both hands. Cannot aim. Dissapointed
515. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water, and I've never found other flavored waters or flavored drops to be enjoyable, as you can always taste an overly sweet, fake flavor. I received a bottle of Coconut Water Drops as part of a birthday gift, and I became OBSESSED. With just a squeeze or two of these infusion drops, I can drink bottle after bottle of water, and it fits into my new zero-sugar lifestyle. The only downside is the price...a bottle of water infusion drops lasts me less than two weeks, so it's pricey to keep up with my obsession, though the fact that these drops make my water so yummy that I avoid soda probably makes it worth it.
516. love the tp or paper towel trash bag combo great combo. i wish they had a combo that had toilet paper paper towels and kitchen trash bags with smaller bags. id buy that all at once weekly
517. WORTH IT.
518. It works as described, but I bought it without reading the ingredients and it contains Egg Yolk which I am allergic to it 😐
519. I have been using this for years now if I switch it to something else my teeth becomes sensitive.
520. When they stayed in place they worked good. I used them with a more open toe (perhaps they work better in a closed shoe?When I could get them to stay in place the comfort was good and I didn’t mind the toe thing. At least it didn’t bother. They just don’t work for any flat that is open.
521. My pelvic therapist uses this and suggested it for others to use. Medically, it doesn't burn or cause me problems at all. Easily washed clean.
522. Straps were twisted and I couldn’t get it untwisted now matter which way I turned them.  Not too comfortable as straps go under bust.
523. Easy to use, easy to move and fits my shower head perfectly.  I can put this holder anywhere in my shower tub combo and it will stay put.  I highly recommend it if you are taking care of rinsing off your kids in the tub or cleaning your tub or washing pets in the tub (to lower the handle).  Also, if you need a handle higher up in the shower (like for my giantly tall brother when he visits), not he can put the shower head at his height.  I highly recommend this product.  All pros, no cons for this product so far.
524. great supplement. quality and quick and packaged well.
525. Love using these on my contacts. They always feel so refreshed in the morning
526. Nice and comforting.
527. I have been using this tape underneath the stretch tape for a few years as recommended by my therapist.  Just want to let reader know that photo shows is a new packaginhg, this is a true BSN product.
528. Took it once and made me very sick. Yuck! And no returns.
529. This works great guides on without tugging and the color isn’t too dark. I cannot find this in the store, so happy to find it here.
530. I needed a new small travel jewlery keeper and this works well and fits the stuff I bring on vacation. I like the compartments and the quilted zipper case. Good purchase and the price was good too.
531. I used this brace for support while going through physical therapy for low back and sciatica pain
532. Hoping it solves the hard water problem
533. I'm very happy with this spray cleaner.  It smells great and not sticky.  I would try other &#34;flavors&#34; when I run out of peppermint.
534. I LOVE these bars!  They are a bit chewy and can get really hard if they're cold, but I still give them 5 stars bc they are one of the best egg free paleo bars on the market.
535. Pumpkin seed oil is a culinary specilty that is also often found in food supplements. It's a more readily available form of pumpkin seeds which are presumed to treat bladder irritation, kidney infections, intestinal worms, and trouble urinating due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). My dad is in his 60s has started to develop prostate difficulties.I advised for him to take pumpkin seed oil capsules and he says that urination is much easier and clinically there are no concerns from his doctor.
536. Artichoke is only readily available in stores occasionally. Supplementation is helpful to those who have an enlarged liver, as according to WebMD, artichoke stimulated the flow of bile from the liver. This is great because it helps with high cholesterol, IBS, kidney problems, anemia, edema, arthritis, bladder infections and other liver problems, as well as reduces alcohol hangovers as well as reduces symptoms of heartburn.Additionally, Web MD says that &#34;some people use artichoke for treating snakebites, preventing gallstones, lowering blood pressure, lowering blood sugar; to increase urine flow; and as a tonic or stimulant.&#34;I wanted to try artichoke as a hangover supplement but did not experience any lessening of symptoms. The taste of these capsules is acceptable and the size is on the smaller size. If the reports are even remotely right about cynarin (the active ingredient in artichoke), then this supplement is worth taking.
537. Good esp for the price
538. Total junk, plus size they sent could have fit Goliath. I made an adaption to make smaller, still a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!
539. Pure Holy Basil. Great to reduce stress and ease into a great night of sleep.
540. Reishi was apparently the king of mushrooms at some point, but now is called the queen of mushroom. King or queen, it doesn't really matter. It's awesome. It's an adaptogen that helps with stress and sleep and many other things. Real Mushrooms is an amazing company that delivers the goodies that you should get from the mushroom, unlike most of the other companies (which basically delivers starch to you). So Real Mushrooms is the real deal, and I highly recommend this to people. I use it daily.
541. I buy this from him directly or from a channel on TV, but I want to say it's one of my favorite shakes. The flavor and high quality ingredients are what keep my buying it again and again. I even blend it into my coffee for a "bulletproof-ish" style coffee drink. It's so yummy and filling and thick.
542. I like anything I can do that will improve my health. It doesn't take much time or effort to stand on this mat. It has really helped with the tight tendons though the bottom of my feet.
543. Great feel of card for professional environment.  I will continue to purchase.  The sympathy cards are also a great deal.
544. Hilarity.  They say laughing increases your health and even arranging your face into a smile tricks your brain into believing your more happy.  So far so good...
545. This really is wonderful to add for Pad Thai.  I'm sure this could be found in an Asian market, but there isn't a well stocked one close by.
546. This really really really works. Helps hide your smoking habit!
547. Got this for my son for Christmas.  He LOVES it!! He's a welder in a machine shop and his body pays a price. It arrived today and he tested it out at my urging with no real hope for it doing much...he's had other products in the past and nothing really gets into deep tissue and reverberates out and makes a difference for him to have any relief.  I did his back for 10 mins with this...and he was smiling!! Not to make his mom feel good but because something finally got his muscles to relax.  The 2 heads on this are what I think do the trick for making it all happen.  The various speeds and alternate attachments will be an added benefit in the long run.  It's easy to balance and he managed as well to do it but not as good as when someone else does it LoL
548. This is the most YUMM and PERFECT chocolatebeet powder.  I use it in baking.  It's the only way that I can get my grankids to eat beets. I use it in red velvet deserts too with red gel coloring for extra brightness.  This has a great taste on its own even tho it has a bitter quality but that is part of the life of brilliant untreated chocolate.  It blends into hot cocoa, cream cheese, batters, whipped cream and when I whip cream into butter for a different spin on things and at that point, I will add coconut sugar that has been finely ground into the whip as well to work on bringing sweetness. There really is no limit to creation with this product... I'm going to need to get more.
549. I was skeptical kinda, I feel it really works actually. I think this and evening primrose an magnesium citrate help me get pregnant. I had extreme infertility problems took 5 years to get pregnant. Honestly this helped in my concotion of natural fertility treatment for PCOS
550. If you’ve read any of my other keto reviews then you already know that I LOVE chocolate...but it’s really tough not being able to eat all my favorite  desserts anymore. I actually emailed kiss my keto and asked them what sort of replacement for treats there was and they pointed me here - Perhaps the biggest gift of 2018 so far!I add the powder to my morning coffee and now have coffee shop quality flavored coffee with 9g of high quality MCT inside :) on top of that there’s no guilt from sugar since it’s not the same crap they use in stores. I’ve yet to bake with the powder but that’s going to change this weekend.Sorry, I’m rambling a bit here because this stuff is so good. Let’s get down to business. Taste 1010. Value 1010. Guilt from eating 010. Sugar free. 9 grams of good MCT.Honestly these guys have done it again. I asked GNC if they would be carrying them - the guy knew the brand but wasn’t sure if the store was going to get it...really hope they do!
551. It works well. It took quite a few pumps to get good traction.
552. Perfect for putting Brother Tze tapes in.
553. Great product,  price and fast delivery.
554. Perfect for putting Brother Tze tapes in.
555. Great product,  price and fast delivery.
556. Definitely can tell a difference in pump when using this product versus not. Some over stimulated after if you take it to late.
557. Been using he product for about a month. Definitely notice a difference in joint inflammation. Less pain caused by heavy lifting and over use.
558. I wish I had known about this product sooner...I already supplement with flaxseed oil for my rosacea, use Ecological Formula's TriSalts daily... and now this has nearly relieved my nervevein damage pain (from blood clots in legfoot) ...instantly. I can live better as a 20-something ... thank you so much Environmedica!
559. For 90 servings, I think I paid about $30, and in my view, it was worth it even tho the flavor is mediocre at best. I use it almost daily.
560. No gimmicks. These straps keep my sunglasses on my face while I run, and are easy to install (just slide them onto the end of the earpieces on your glasses).I had issues with my sunglasses sliding down my nose as I ran, and having to constantly push them back up. Using these straps, my sunglasses stay and place, and I completely forget I’m even wearing glasses.Great buy!
561. I have been taking magnesium capsules for a long time, and I wanted to try topical form magnesium. You can feel the relaxing effect just few minutes after it is apply.
562. I love this product and it's great for so many ailments. It's definitely an acquired taste and it's not particularly cheap, but I think every household should have it in their medicine cabinet.
563. I prefer my battery operated warming socks in frigid WI.  Sorry : (
564. Used massage rings for stocking stuffers and everyone loved them!  Great price and great gifts.
565. First of all I’m a chiropractor that specializes in corrective care and this is my new absolute favorite traction device. First of all it’s adjustable so you’ll be able to customize the perfect fit for yourself. And as far as the design goes… It’s comfortable and snug. I noticed immediate relief in tension and increased range of motion. Bravo ChiroLux.
566. I love pine pollen and love this product. I love the capsules. I usually take in warm water but this is so easy and I feel I get the same effect. Good circulation and better general well being.
567. Very cute for a boy shower, all you need!
568. Delivery was very prompt! I was very glad to see that my package was not damaged and arrived before the set delivery date! As for the product, I honestly had to try it as soon as it arrived. Directions included in the package are clear, and the set up is quite simple as well.  Just did my first treatment today and felt comfortable with the process. I have yet to see any noticeable results after my first session of course, but I will provide an update after the first 4 sessions :)
569. While I love the convenience... it is a lot cheaper to make this yourself. The lime seems the most popular and it happens to be the easiest to make. You can buy Redmond's real salt, use the fine ground popcorn variety, as your sodium. Add some CALM for magnesium and you can get potassium powder quite cheap. You can get True Lime powder for the lime flavoring and use a packet of SteviaErythritol for the sweetener.  Voila! If you want the raspberry, just get some freeze dried raspberries and crush them into a powder and add a little.
570. Stick well enough but not large enough. I wear a 40.
571. Will not stay in place on back on chair!
572. Unable to use until repeatedly washed. Had odor.
573. Versatile, skin friendly, and very portable.  This is my go-to shaver when I'm out on the road and feel a 5 o'clock shadow creeping in.  Good battery life, easy to clean.  No complaints.  Love this thing.
574. I have been using this product for years for my contacts. Is seems I get a lot of build up on my lens and even my eye doctor says this is the best product I can use. As long as it is used correctly there isn’t any eye irritation but don’t accidentally rinse your contacts and then put it in your eye because it will burn and irritate them for a very long time!I have less stars for travel since there doesn’t seem to be a travel size and I need to carry the full size bottle.
575. Good quality hair support.
576. Like the scent, but quality control is poor as some of the cans don't work.
577. These must have come from a bad batch. I bought these to replacer previously purchased refills that weren't working. The spray is coming out of the bottom of the head of the spray can and filling up the holder, not spraying out into the air. This is a manufacturing issue and poor quality control.
578. Great scent for the holidays. Hard to find. However the spray cans are defective. They don’t spray right. The spray comes out of the neck instead of the top, so all of the spray accumulates in the dispenser. Didn’t find this out until decorating for Christmas and was too late to return for refund. This was the first time this has ever happened so I am chalking it up to a bad batch and won’t let it keep me from buying again. In fact the second order that came later is working fine. The manufacturer needs better quality control.
579. This is lovely and arrived quicker than had been estimated. Get compliments on it, but people can't tell if this is supposed to be an angel, butterfly or dragonfly. Neither can I but I love it.
580. my go to morning tonic.....every morning
581. not so satisfied with the flavor, although the ingredients are really good
582. It’s antifungal and helps itching  crawling
583. I saw no difference in the air quality - I had it on the second setting
584. I have good results with this product but am seriously thinking of finding a replacement since whenever I open the bottle there is a HUGE ball of cotton in which I have to dig and dig and DIG to get it out...this time was really ridiculous and might I mention, not very sanitary.  I just don't understand why some companies haven't switched over to the silicone gel or package that collects moisture which helps keep it fresh while using.
585. Reasonably priced, nice quality, quick delivery.
586. I had a couple pair of blue-light blocking glasses already but wanted more for husband and to keep in other rooms so I didn't have to carry them around from room to room.  I actually like the "orange" better than the amber.  Glasses fit well and are well madeclear and comfortable.  Glad I bought the 4 pack!
587. I bought a pack of 10 because we love them so much!
588. These were a good value, well made and did the job!
589. This Disney bag is soooo cute.
590. I love this stuff.  I'm not sure of it's health benefits but it has great flavor and is a healthier alternative than a lot of other additives to water.
591. nearly see-through junk.took a long time to ship.
592. This works great on my toothbrush, tight enough to not fall off too easily when traveling and also keeps it clean at ho from dust and other things in the air.
593. They did the job of full-filling requirements without suffocating me.
594. I got it for my mom who has a huge problem with her glasses sipping down her nose. She says that it kind of works. But I do have know if I'll buy it again.
595. Good quality, great price just as I was expecting.
596. I have eyelash extensions and this mask fits perfectly without damaging the extension. Will buy again in a heartbeat!
597. I'm not sure that this brush should be advertised as exfoliating. The bristles are very soft. I would have like a firmer brush; but that's one of the problems of shopping on line. You cannot examine the merchandise before purchasing.
598. Worked well right out of the box.
599. Could not work without them. Can read for pleasure w ease.
600. Ok not what I expected
601. Used for sleeping in diffuser, didn’t give the effect I needed.
602. They nice for soap makimg, but when cuttin with a serrated knife, it really isnt easy. I found it difficult in cutting the loofah sponge.
603. I originally found the mango version shopping at Boots in Thailand.  I tried this and can testify it works.  You have to mix it quickly as directed with water and drink it quickly. Its all fiber and it will help you have the greatest movement if you need that help. This flavor I got was citrus from my order.  I hope the seller will provide mango.  EXCELLENT!!!
604. The baggies they come in are pretty cool. If only the electrodes contained within were not of the worst quality I have experiencedz I have 1.5 years of needing transdermal e. nerve stim in order to bear the pain if walking with my spine all jacked. these are  The worst! They are gooey sticky yet barely adhere to the skin... had to use electrical tape to get em to stay wout shocking me... now if unlike me you remain stationary  for the stim as well as don't need them on constant it may still be a good buy... but maybe no cuz re-using these pads isn't really an option... & they leave gooey goo boogars on ya... Party foul & for shame electrodes for shame!
605. Returned it.  There was practically no fragrance at all. The automatic spray is great! Not the wax.
606. Beware! These came shipped fine (shipping container in tact's) but the  tegaderm boxes have smashed corners that look like they've been sitting in liquid. They smell like chemical. I attempted to do a return and was told "there are no returns on this item" despite just opening the package today after receiving it 4 days ago.This is a pretty expensive loss to take and if you need this for medication patches like I do, it's quite a bummer. Go somewhere else to purchase.
607. There is no scent unless you stick your face right up on these so they are pretty worthless as air fresheners. I tried this in a closet, in an office and in a drawer. Nothing. I recommend you don't waste your money.
608. These pads are super thick and high quality. They don't leak. Heavy duty! I wish they were larger and less expensive.I use them as dog pads for 2 small dogs. Not sure how they hold up for bed protection for people but they are the best quality I've ever gotten.
609. Like it, but sometime cumbersome to use
610. Now sure what they’re talking about warmth.  I love this flosser.  It has different setting, I use soft which is still pretty strong.  The water pulsates through and you have to be careful with how wide your mouth is open or water gets everywhere.  Definitely makes me want to use it.  Only drawback is where the buttons are placed, I’ve accidentally turned it on a few times and water sprayed all over the place.  The water tank holds enough for two uses, but the charger lasts forever.
611. Really expensive for what you get.  Not really that exciting. If you are looking for a laugh and want to spend a lot to get it....then go ahead.
612. A friend of mine recommended that I take this, and I can honesty say I feel a lot better, I have a lot more energy and I’m sleeping better.
613. Good material
614. I just got them. Did a lot of comparisons before purchasing. From what I’ve researched, women ‘like me over 60’ need collagen supplement.
615. I just got them. Did a lot of comparisons before purchasing. From what I’ve researched, women ‘like me over 60’ need collagen supplement.
616. Very Nice!! But be gentle! A beginner could easily use to much pressure and harm the nail!
617. This was an awesome find. Lots of herbs, more than expected and packaged with great quality. I really enjoyed this. It's definitely giftable but I'd rather keep it.
618. I only use this on my face,
619. I am buying another one because this was VERY NEEDED! I can actually walk around the house without my knee brace, given by the hospital, at home! It's also added support with my knee brace.One HUGE MISTAKE was washing it. Do they expect it to never be washed???So, ordering a new one. And this time reading washing instructions or washing by hand next time.
620. I’ve always loved this toothpaste! Great tasting and effective! Plus no mess and no wasted toothpaste.
621. It’ll take me forever to use all of these tags. But they are gorgeous. Exactly what I was looking for.
622. They are nice looking and do not look like &#34;old lady socks&#34;.  I am in my 40s and had sclerotherapy done and wanted support after i got done wearing the ones the Dr had me use but I didnt want ugly socks or socks that made my feet get too hot with my tennis shoes.  They stay up and make my legs feel better when i wear them.
623. Said in the description that these were &#34;easy to swallow&#34;. These are the same size as every other regular sized fish oil capsule I've taken.
624. I appreciate the price as well as the product and I continue to come back to it each time I run out.
625. I love this pillbox with Fox Hunt theme
626. I had to mount the back part of the stand-up. I thought it came ready to put up like the other stand-ups that I had bought before. I had to tape the back part of the stand-up. Now I am wondering how I am going to take the tape off without tearing it, so that I can store it away until I need it again for next yearBut other than that, I think it really looks great!
627. Fort of all the containers are very sturdy and the piil have a smallPocket to fill it just not sitting on the bottom of container
628. Calsules were easy to swallow and no bad taste to the capsules
629. Great product! Relieves upset stomach as well as heartburn.
630. Love the price. I use this in every diaper change for my baby to prevent diaper rash. He’s been having an intolerance to certain things in my diet, and while I’m trying to figure out what the intolerance is to, one of the symptoms for him is consistent diaper rash. I almost gave up on breastfeeding because of all the complications and the diaper rash just drew the line for me. A friend mentioned to use petroleum jelly. If it wasn’t for this, I would’ve been going crazy and so would my baby.
631. Sometimes this works against my nighttime leg cramps and sometimes it doesn't, but I still like to have it on hand.
632. Good support not bulky. Can be easily hidden user a t-shirt. After a few days of wearing the pain started to go away. I'm very satisfied. I've tried several posture correctors but this one is the best one yet.
633. I use this product for gut health.
634. I have recently received the Polisa PostureI have recently received the Polisa Posture Corrector and am amazed at how easy it is to adjust it and wear it.  The product is well constructed and is so adjustable that I can use it and so can my husband.  We are looking forward to many years of use of this quality product.
635. Please use vinegar for weeds and not poison!  As a cancer surviver I would never use poison when vinegarworks!  I add dishsoap also and it works great.  Spray when weeds are small and you use much less product and nip it in the bud before weeds get out of hand.  I always use vinegar 30% straight with added dishsoap. Perfect, safe and simple!!
636. My favorite of all the Wen I tried.
637. Great scissors, but a little small for a man's hands. Hey, who said nurse means woman's size?
638. I was hoping the table cloth wasn’t just a camo boarder but overall it was great for my sons 9th birthday party
639. This cleaner is junk and dissolves into a gel- like mess in the tank.  It doesn't seem like it does anything but cost money and does nothing.  Am throwing away the rest and would never buy again.
640. Unfortunately these are way to easily broken.  They break as soon as they poke or bend in the slightest way.
641. Please use vinegar for weeds and not poison!  As a cancer surviver I would never use poison when vinegarworks!  I add dishsoap also and it works great.

642. My favorite of all the Wen I tried.
643. Nice chair. Not as padded as I would like. Vibration works great. A few nicks on the wood base. Not enough for me to ship back. All in all I like the chair.Update:I have had this chair for over 2 years now and still am enjoying this chair. The vibration feature is still working and still in decent shape. We did have to retighten the base a couple times but besides that, still happy with the purchase.
644. Do not waste your money
645. Convenient way to store & protect credit cards from fraud.  Easy push button opener.  Fits all my cards and slides easily into my pocket or purse.  Peace of mind.
646. It is found to have heavy metals in this &#34;Altay&#34; less costly mixture.
647. I added this to my smoothie, its got a great, definitely, I definitely recommended this to everyone who wanted to live a healthy and happy life style plus super fast shipping. Great seller.
648. Comes conveniently boxed. Easily portable. Three adapters in one. Multi LED lights. Brightens just like whitener from dentist office. Mouth piece is comfortable. Soft.
649. Great taste!
650. I was debating on getting this or peel but I stuck with this and I’m glad I find it easier. Only thing was the file I think it was fell of which I don’t mind I never used it before was my fault left under running water was able to reattach it.
651. This floss shredded in my husband’s teeth and he was so disgusted! He had to find Glide floss just to get the strands of this floss out of his teeth! Disappointing.
652. One of the bottles was leaking when I opened my package but I was able to wipe the bottle down with no issues. The product itself works wonders on the dreaded yellow, breastfeed baby poop! I found that I had to use a little more product than anticipated to help ease the stain out but overall, happy with purchase. Also, Dreft products always smell amazing!
653. Shipping sucked! Loose in package,  lid off  product leaked. Seems to work well though. Just be aware you may be short of product after shipping.
654. Nice small tablet that is easy to swallow. No nasty aftertaste. Very good addition to vitamin regimen. I have purchased these various times and will purchase again in the future
655. This was useful when I had it. Gave me an effective way of straigtening my hair without burning my skin off!! Lol heheh... Anyway, now I just don’t have as much of a problem with my hair being curly so I don’t need this as much. But I keep it in case I need to straighten my hair for an event or occasion bcs I don’t want to go back to normal straighteners. So glad this exists!
656. I was trying to get the hard water stains off my shower door. I'd say the product helped, but did not get rid of the spots. Will try again. Maybe it needs more  frequent applications.
657. It's not bad. I haven't felt any 'results' as others have so I am going on faith that it will deliver benefits over time. You must mix it with berries or something, the taste by itself is a little rustic for me. I make it as a keto smoothie with some heavy whipping cream, fruit, water, a touch of stevia. Doable.
658. If I could give it a negative star I would.  I ignored the negative reviews because I wanted to believe I would like it. Some people do.  It is sweetened with Maltitol which spikes my blood sugar. Maltitol syrup has a glycemic index of 52, which approaches that of table sugar at 60.  I prefer Erythritol or stevia.  The listing on the website did not show the ingredients; it just stated &#34;no added sugar.&#34;  I should have been cautious when ingredients were not listed.  Even worse, they have a &#34;no return&#34; policy.
659. It is ok, the bristles come out when using it.
660. feels more like a rag than paper towel. I also love the designs!
661. Awesome product, i love it!
662. One of the best tasting low carb bars out there, definitely in the top 5.  Grenade knows how to make a good tasting bar and has spread that knowledge across all flavors - very good!
663. It gets hotwarm. Provides temporary soothing
664. Fits great around the belt.Turn off: smell.But once you get passed that odor one way or another, it's good to have in your bmw.
665. I like these, well packaged as well
666. Perfect for whay I've used it for . I thought I had kidney stones . Worked well
667. The GOOAD Dog Clippers work well and are surprisingly quiet. This is great when trimming as my dog is skittish. The rechargeable batteries and extra attachments make this a great value.
668. Good product
669. It’s hard to find a good pre workout at a decent price, even harder to find a product that delivers what the label promises. All I have to say is “BUY THIS” , you will definitely enjoy it. Good energy, great pumps and excellent flavor.
670. The case was over all a buy, it holds my MLG Gunnars fine and is a nice coated leather. The only issue that I would say it has, is that it is kind of flimsy when opening, however the magnets hold when the case is closed.
671. Wow this was waaaay smaller than I thought it would be. I'm very smol, and yet this is still too small for me. Maybe this would work as a back washer for a child under 10, but not sure how exactly to use this when at a general size of an adult. My back gets itchy, and I figured that meant I should probably wash it better or something, so I was looking for something to help with that. This doesn't cover enough ground (due to small size) to really work as a way to wash my back. However, when it's dry the roughness of the loofa part comes in handy as a back scratcher when needing to itch specific small areas of my back lol. But sadly I'm still looking for something that will actually help wash my back.
672. I found that that hard round bit that goes over your knee was very uncomfortable, and actually made my knee hurt more.
673. I use this form of curcumin more for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (neuro protective). Having said this, I also find it to be an excellent anti-inflammatory.
674. As a full-time caregiver of a person suffering the symptoms of Alzheimer's, I've been struggling with finding good products for her dual incontinence issues.  After finding a great adult diaper that holds her through the night, we've noticed that the diapers have an unpleasant smell to them (worth a bit of odor if I don't have to do laundry of the complete bedding 1-2x per day).  My sister works as a medical assistant and she told me that this is what all the medical assistants keep at their desks to eliminate odors whenever an exam room needs it.  I ordered this product as well as another one by a different manufacturer.  Hands down, this is the far superiior product (same as used at the hospital).  While they both worked on the odor, this one only takes 1-2 sprays in the room and the odors disappear, and the best part is the small fragrance you smell once you spray, goes away and it just smells fresh!!  I cannot recommend this product enough!!
675. These are cute. I wish they came with something else, but they do the job of tipping cupcakes just fine.
676. AMAZING...love these. Thank you. :)
677. These were the first LED lamps I've ever purchased.We have a ceiling fan in our family room and for some reason both filament bulbs and CFLs were burning out quickly (within 3 months) in one of the four sockets. This despite the fact that we don't use the fan all that much. Also, this particular fixture gets a lot of use in our home (the lights, not the fan). So if I could save energy on lighting this application struck me as an opportunity to achieve the greatest payback on the investment.These bulbs have a small footprint, not much bigger than a normal incandescent lamp. This was important because they had to fit inside the diffuser globes. Like most LED lamps they send most of the light out the top. In a ceiling fixture with four sockets this behavior is not at all objectionable; but might be a problem with a reading lamp or other single-bulb fixture.The four bulbs draw a lot less power yet throw noticeably more light than CFLs with the same lumen rating. In fact I'm getting a lot more light from these lamps than I expected to.All LED lamps are currently a little pricey, but these are a good deal for what they are, and they have held up well. So far, I'm very happy with them. As long as they continue to function they should pay for themselves in a couple of years.UPDATE FEB 2014:  In the last 8 months I've had no problems with these LED lamps burning out. I've never had that level of success with either filament lamps or with CFLs in this ceiling fan fixture. Just the fact that I don't have to get out a 6-foot step ladder every two months has me very happy with this product.
678. Been using this cleaning product for several years. Been to my satisfaction.
679. this all around and only muffles slightly
680. This is a good assortment of nice Christmas cards without sickly sweet catch phrases.  -Just your basic, good Christmas cards.
681. Make sure you don't buy a baby product because the smell will drive you crazy.
682. A very soft blanket, and comfortable for sleeping (in Sunnyvale, CA). It is exactly a queen size, not too big. I hope it doesn't shred.
683. It has been a while since we had these cookies. They arrived intact and the price was great
684. I put it in orange juice because the oil has an orange flavor.  It leaves my mouth feeling oily
685. My lower back was super tight, no idea that it was my hips that was effecting me, purchased this to help me Stretch.I feel so much better.
686. My wife loves this.
687. Not quite as high quality as I was hoping for, but it works well.  We will see how long it lasts, may edit this review in a few months. Also had to trim out the opening for the charger to plug in, it wasn't big enough for my charger cord to fully seat.
688. I am posting this for my star rating only.Make no mistake, I really enjoy this.I don't feel like taking the time to write something meaningful.
689. Product is exactly as described.
690. Does no work at all! very disappointed. Received it over the weekend and added some as directed but it was still slipping.  And to add, the wax got into one of my lens and now the lens is blurry and stained. So technically my glasses got messed up because of this product.
691. This really works.
692. good product
693. I've used the TEPE sulca brush for a couple of years now. 1st rate. I decided to try this larger brush and it is of the same quality as the sulca brush. The handle is a good fit to my hand. It is gentle on the teeth and gums, something a 67 years old needs.
694. Love this product. Mixes easily and taste great  Metabogreens is powerpacked with fruits,veggies, spices,herbs and gives me the energy I Thought I'd lost!!Thanks BioTRUST.
695. GREAT PRODUCT.I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT.IT WORKS.
696. I ordered this by mail when I was away from home to be sure it would be waiting for me when I returned.  These vitamins are recommended by health care professionals for women.
697. cleans ball well
698. Good product for a great price. Fits my electric toothbrush perfectly.
699. I have used at least 10 of these grabbers over the last 8 years that I’ve been wheelchair bound. They are remarkable in design but on this particular one the handle split on the 2nd day of use. It is not the norm an I will be asking for a replacement. I will update my comments then ..
700. I have been happy with this product for surface-dirt removal on old non-glossy dustjackets, cloth boards and spines, and the page block edges (quick swipe 'with the grain' along the top-edge takes off dust build-up). I have found it especially good for brightening up cloth boards that have become dingy with surface dirt. This is not a stain-remover. If you deal with a lot of dusty books, this is good for freshening them up.UPDATE: We are about to re-order some of these. We got a good year out of them, and really should have re-ordered at that point. It speaks well of the product that we've been able to squeeze another year out of them. We rinse them now and then, but in the second year the sponges are still functional, but they start to crumble and lose little pieces. It's a sponge, and we use them pretty heavily, so this is not a big problem for me. The price is right for replacement. We'll re-order again I am sure.We use these to clean dust off the top of the page block, and to take surface dust and mold off of the boards of a hardcover. Sometimes when end-papers get moldy, you can use these sponges to take the worst of it off. Same with the underside of dust jacket that has been exposed to mold.
701. Good price on safety cotton swabs.
702. Thank you
703. I already have previous sport elite model and got one because of new tens added. It is a great function and I expect the best. Great service from the buyer, and good price. Thanks
704. I already have the lower leg protector and can vouch it is an excellent product and really keeps your cast or dressing dry.  I sent this one for the arm back because it is the same exact thing as the lower leg product.  If all you need is protection for the handwristelbow - don't hesitate to get it.
705. These round pink ice packs are manufactured by the same company that manufactures the blue round ice packs. I bought the blues ones about 3 months ago when I was suffering from my first attack of eyelid dermatitis. The blue ones worked well. They came in a travel handy plastic zippered case. They did take about 24 hours to get fully iced.I had a second attack of eyelid dermatitis this month and found that with the time required to ice, I needed more than 5 round ice packs in a day. So I ordered the cheaper pink packs because money is tighter this month. They came. First, they are not in a travel handy plastic zippered case. I will have to supply my own zip baggy. Second, now that I have started to use them, I am surprised because they seem to not stay icy as long as the blue ones. Why should color make a difference? The substance inside seems less gel like too. Am I crazy, imagining this?Between my osteoarthritis knees (yes, the right one is acting up now too) and what is turning out to be repetitive bouts of eyelid dermatitis, I am getting to be a connoisseur of icing and ice packs. So I don't think I am imagining this even if it seemingly makes no sense. Next time I order, it's is back to the blue ones and damn the higher cost. The pink ones work, they just work for a shorter time.BTW: Using these round packs for my right knee too: slip them between layers of my ace bandage wrap right over the medial point next to my patella that burns. The point is higher up than the medial meniscus so I have screwed up something different on the right knee than left knee. Learning to watch how I move my knees (very carefully) to prevent all future injuries. Going to watch sumo wrestling for overweight knee movement pointers. I am overweight but not sumo level (Oh Lord, thank you!) but between rx meds that make it hard and slow to lose weight and two medical conditions that make it hard and slow to lose weight, I need the big sumo guys help in knee movements. Help me sumo guys: how do you keep you knee joints in good shape?
706. Simple to use, works awesome.
707. I LOVED this lip balm when I first started using it.  After daily use for two months, I'm having a terrible reaction.  The lip balm causes irritation, dry, throbbing and cracking lips.  There is also truth to the mold issue for this product.  Do your research.  I have an unopened 5 pack that I plan to return asap.  Do yourself a favor and don't use. I'm not sure how long it will take the negative affects to go away, but I've thrown all of my used items away.
708. Just like washcloth good product!Ann H, MD
709. teeth looks white and clean after 10 brushes. twice daily.
710. I use it on my skin alone or with coconut oil. Great fragrance and is terrific for the skin.
711. I love this bracelet Perfect fit for Ladies with small wrists. I were it all the time even in water, and has not Tarnished..
712. Disclaimer:  I have an autoimmune issue that is giving me a lot of food sensitivities. My diet is currently restricted from food groups so I am Paleo. I have tried different protein powders and mixes. After mostly miss rather than hit, it was recommended that I try the beef protein isolate. I make a smoothie most mornings with mostly vegetables and 12 a granny smith apple.  It would be nutritious for me, but my tummy did not like the pea protein powder and I would be slightly queasy after drinking it.  Today, I made my smoothie using this powder and WOW!!! It tastes great.  It was a big difference going down. My tummy likes this stuff.  I have to use this pure because other mixes might be too sweet.  This is a great product that delivers.  Seriously - just one smoothie and I am definitely on board with this for good!  No more switching around.  And the price is reasonable as well. Who could ask for more!
713. very comfortable
714. cheap but effective
715. This probiotic was recommended by my ocupancturist to promote my immune system two years ago. I have been taking one a day and it has been working very well for me. When I get a cold it won't last a long time.
716. Woks great at lowering blood pressure and is reasonable priced!
717. Not buying another bottle. No results from this product.
718. I started using Clear Tract powder about 6 months ago. I have a 20 year history of bladder infections and the antibiotics weren't cutting it anymore. I haven't had one since using Clear Tract. Works best on gram-negative bacteria such as e-coli. If you have gram-positive bacteria (which I also had), oil of oregano works like a charm on those types of bladder infections. I developed a staph (gram-positive) bladder infection months ago and it was resistant to antibiotics. The only thing that cured it was oil of oregano. I'll never take antibiotics again unless it's a life-or-death situation.Between Clear Tract, oil of oregano, krill oil supplements and probiotics, in addition to really improving my diet, I haven't had an infection since. Actually, I haven't been sick at all since, either. My daughter currently has the flu with vomiting and diarrhea, but I feel great! Try Clear Tract-it really works!
719. Exactly what I asked for in a timely manner.
720. Helps with cramps and blood flow.
721. I love Soothing Wellness Essentials carrying cases! I first purchased the one that holds 96 and liked it so much I got the larger one, too. The inserts protect the oils and I like that it has pockets inside the top. The case is so easy to carry and store. Looks fantastic!
722. Excellent oil! I put it in my coffee every morning!
723. hard to find sunrider products anymore..glad i found these gems again!!!
724. Almost too thick.  They are the correct size but it's hard to get them to stay put.  They also got packed down after walking with them for 2 hrs.  Feet still hurt and got blistered.
725. Purchased on recommendation from my physical therapist.  This is a great product to align my body when sitting in the car.  Great support, size and quality!
726. Ok but not working fo me
727. I use this to make magnesium oil.  I add 1 part water to 12 part flakes (ex. 1 oz water to 12 oz flakes). If you want it stronger use 1 to 1 (ex 1 oz distilled water to 1 oz flakes). Best to store in a spray bottle. Can also be used as a deodorant.
728. Ordered 5 bottles, only 3 arrived, the box was totally sodden, all three bottles leaked, 2 completely empty, one almost also..So I didn’t have a chance to try the product.
729. not as good as extra strength though,,,,I normally use the extra strength,,,,and after taking these,,,I did notice they were not as good
730. As an older person, I wanted to correct my posture so ordered this (after trying another brand without being satisfied with it).  It was easy to put on and adjust.  After a while, I forgot I had it on as it was quite comfortable.  I have not had any pain but, day by day, I can feel it holding my spine better erect.  I will continue to wear it for a while each day until I have reached my goal.  I even like the pretty pink color.
731. I think I love it.  Having done research on edema, swelling of the feet and legs, I am trying this for circulation.  So far, shortly after taking this supplement, I find a slight reduction of the swelling.  Hopefully, as I continue to use this, am hopeful that it will improve.  Will also be trying other ways to help this problem.
732. Very good results with a pleasant scent.  There are so many biting insects here at this time of the year when the monsoons are present.  Am not outside all day long as it is raining, but while I am there and using this Avon product, the insects stay away.  I can actually sit and watch the hummingbirds without being bothered!!  I am pleased with this lotion and have purchased a second one.  Would recommend.
733. I have been using a water machine to alkalize and purity the water for several years.  My research shows that it removes many minerals along with the chlorine and fluoride which is why I purchased it.  So, using the Purely-Min is my way of replacing the minerals.  I have used this brand of herbs and spices (North American Herb & Spice Co.) for many years and it is one of the best.  Nice to see that Amazon is selling it.
734. Have been purchasing these same magnesium tablets for quite a while as one sure way to get magnesium.  I like that they are time released thus giving me a constant supply all day.  JigSaw produces a quality product.
735. There's no indication on the label what the source is (fish, bovine, etc).  The label looks like it was just &#34;slapped together&#34; for the sake of making a label, not to provide any information regarding source or quality.  I'm returning it because because it's too questionable.
736. the box came with 100% COMPOSTABLE printing on it - so how will these hold up for long term storage of clothing???  will I go into our inventory some day to find them decomposing?  I haven't even opened the box yet, wondering if I need to send them back, then are for our business, to store blank garments in (that we imprint for customers), I was planning to use these bags for years with rotating inventory, they are the only thing I could find in the right size, but we can't have them start rotting away on us
737. A little pricey but does what it says.
738. This kit contains everything you need for a party!!! Adorable pattern.  The plastic ware is sturdy and so are the cups and plates. The hats are well made also.  A must for the unicorn lover in your life.
739. worked great. love it
740. Great product. Its very sturdy, and the blades are sharp enough to cut without much effort. A nice change from the standard cheap and flimsy little clippers.
741. Very uncomfortable and smells so bad I can't tolerate it.  Had to finally get a knee brace with adjustable straps.
742. I've tried alot of nootropics but have settled on optimind as it gives me what I'm looking for consistently. Wish the price was a little lower but it work's as described unlike so many other brand's  I've tried in the past.
743. This oil is amazing. I mix a various oils and make my own facial nourishing moisturizer
744. I personally had one and sent to Mom another one. I didn't see any benefits from it myself. I didn't feel it doing anything about the pain at all. It was soothing to massage into my body and it doesn't have an offensive smell, but as for ending pain... not helpful. Mom said it was okay and it worked ok for her but she hasn't asked me to get her another one so I think it is not a completely fail, but it is not worth it to get again.
745. Good quality. Product as described and looks as per photo provided.
746. I bought this product to improve my muscle mass and tone as exercising doesn't seem to be enough
747. Love the gel it is easy to apply and doesn't take much. I have used it every day it does seem to help.
748. Non recyclable gloves.Hole in 12 gloves within minutes of use.Need I say more?
749. Ive been looking for an organic dandelion and milk thistle supplement and there were no many choices that have both in them. I am sensitive  to alot of things whether it be supplements or food. I have not had any adverse reactions to these but I do not take take them everyday. I have a peace of mind to know I am taking a supplement without some type of pesticide or chemical used.
750. Loved this Waterpik but only lasted 4 months then just stopped working. Very disappointed.
751. I love this dental floss and I can't find it anywhere locally. I hope they haven't stopped making it already. This is the same kind my dentist's office gives me a sample of each time I go in for cleaning. It's the only floss that I can get comfortably in between my teeth.
752. This massager works great to get out the kinks in my neck.The only thing I would change would be if I could adjust the straps. I have longer arms and when I'm using the massager on my neck my arms are at an uncomfortable level. Otherwise it was well worth the money.
753. I bought this product from the Gundry site--three months worth.  I have been 95% faithful to the doctor's admonitions and have received NO benefit for my faithfulness.  The very long video ad is very persuasive but it did not work for me.  Additionally, I'm very physically active and have a healthy diet.  The video presentation's teaser that one might feel a difference in just one week was awesome, but it's not true, folks.  I have lost NO weight, and nothing from around my waist.  I don't know what to make of the &#34;scientific&#34; claims made by this doctor and his prediction of success in weight loss (and better health), but I tend to believe I've been snookered once again.I also got a little suspicious when I was emailed and asked if I didn't want to buy a six months supply.  Additionally, another product (or two) was offered to go with this product.  &#34;Whoa,&#34; I thought, &#34;don't they have confidence that it will work alone and in a reasonable time?&#34;  Nevertheless, I doggedly persisted in the program.
754. I used this item when I was visiting my friend who has a toddler. It removed every stain easily, with a fresh & calming scent. I have a dog and my clothes are sometimes covered in dirt, which has been hard to completely remove prior. I also tend to be a messy cook, and this easily removed grease stains. I have permanently switched from other brands to Dreft. Highly recommend!
755. Filled it myself with all the first aid essentials - it is a nice size bag making everything easy to access
756. This is a great product. I have tried several different straightening devices to straighten my beard this one is the best one. Definitely worth the money. It heats up quickly and if you forget to turn it off they even have a automatic shut-off
757. My husband loves this product and uses it daily. It mixes well, provides the supplementation he wants, and is affordable.
758. These brake after flossing one or 2 teeth. I had to throw them away.

760. I really like this brush for my dog. The handle is very comfortable to hold. I was using a toddler size toothbrush on my dog but this toothbrush is so much easier to hold and makes cleaning my dog's teeth a little bit easier.
761. My husband has always struggled with keeping his health at an overall good place. These vitamins have improved his health so much over the past couple months. He has had so much more energy, and felt so much better about himself since he’s started taking these. They are organic so we love that they are healthy for him and doesn’t cause harm to his body.
762. This razor is a must have for shaving. Purchased for my husband because hes always having issues shaving his beard because of his sensitive skin. This easily helps to remove the hair without giving him an allergic reaction or a bunch of shave bumps. It comes with everything you need including the brush to clean it and the charger to charge it. The battery last shave after shave and allows you to use it time after time but I prefer to make sure that it's fully charged between uses.
763. I love this pump. It’s quick and simple. Easy to use. You can take with you anywhere you go. Best thing I’ve purchased for myself. My favorite part is being able to clean or tend to my baby while pumping. I’m obsessed with these and no longer use my spectra at all. They’re not super quiet but they’re not obnoxiously loud and they hold quite a bit of milk. It has great suction power and is easy to use. Definitely recommend!
764. This product is well made, arrives on time, and works as stated. If you have lower back pain, this is for you! If you suffer from back issues, I’d have to say this is a great device to try. Due to several injuries, my entire back is a mess and I’m in almost constant pain.It is a must have for back massages. It helps me with my back pain and it’s just unbelievably wonderful. I can’t even find the right words to describe it. It’s just so amazing and so worth it. I’m so glad I bought it. I'll keep using it, it is sturdy and consistent. I'm hoping the more I use it, the better I will feel, we will see.
765. This pump is more comfortable and will go unnoticed. This allows you to easily pump anywhere and at anytime. It has 3 modes which are expression Mode, two-in-one Mode, and dual-frequency mode and 7 levels so you get the one that works best for you. It has a LED display that allows you to see the screen clearly day or night. The motor isn't loud so it won't wake your spouse or child. It has anti backflow so don't continimate the milk. It has different sized breast shields so you can choose what works best it has 21mm, 24mm and 28mm shields.
766.  This eye massager is amazing. It has an adjustable strap that allows you to adjust it to any size head. It is a perfect remedy for both tension headaches and migraines and eye discomfort. It massages and heats to give you a relaxing massage. This is well worth the money paid for it and makes a great idea for a gift. Great value
767. I love how this is a wearable breast pump. My daughter in law can discreetly extract breadt milk wherever she is at. Its comfortable to use and doesn't pinch or hurt. It's easy to use and is an affordable way of making sure that my grandchildren get the breast milk they need. Great value.
768. Love the color as purple is one of My favorite colors. It can be heated or not but trust me you'll love it heated. It rolls little balls and bumps under your foot to relax your feet.  Perfect after a long day of work on your feet. It has so many settings for you to choose between and will relax you in no time at all. Would recommend to anybody working hard and being on their feet
769. Great energy pills. Can help you get stuff done or can help you get rock hard. This pill hasn't had any side effects and has been used a few times. Amazing price especially since they really work. They are not only for when you want them sexually but also work to boost your stigma and energy levels.
770.  I purchased this for my dad who has cancer and has issues standing in the shower. This seat fits his tub perfectly and has different levels the seat can sit so it can go higher or lower depending on preference. It has a soap holder too which is nice and a mesh bag. It's a must have for elderly or disabled people. It makes showering much easier because you can sit instead of standing
771. These keto electrolyte drops have helped me to get back on the track to losing weight. They don't taste the best in the world but they don't taste horrible either. They are better taken in something to drink. The bottle is good sized for the price you pay. The keto salt isn't strong tasting which to me is a good thing because I can't hardly stomach that taste. These work good and are a Great value.
772. After my daughter in law had her twins she needed this badly. It had made such a big difference. She can use this twice a day to ease pain and discomfort. It's just as durable and has just as good quality as the ones the hospitals have. We looked at many of these even ones from the medical supplies companies and this one had the best price and looked more comfortable than the rest. Definitely glad we decided on this one. Great value.
773. My sixteen year old suffers from neck and collarbone pain due to a sports injury. This helps him to relieve pain and relax the muscles in his neck. He can lay on this a few minutes at a time a few times a day and it helps tremendously. It's a thick curved pillow that looks uncomfortable but in reality it's the opposite. It steadys his neck and stretches the muscles. Great value
774. My physical therapist recommended that I get a few things to help with my back and hip pain. This was the first thing he suggested. I have tiny stress fractures in my lower back and we ts quite painful at times. This has relieved the pain with stretch and exercise as opposed to heavy medications. Its easy to throw in my gym bag and take anywhere with me so I'm never without my daily regimen. It's affordable and well worth the money. Great value
775. When my doctor suggested stinging nettle root to help me breathe I decided to research and see the benefits and cons of the herb. The more I researched the more the all natural supplements sounded like the right choice. I looked at many different brands before deciding on these. I'm satisfied that I got these. The capsules aren't too big to swallow and leave no nasty aftertaste. With any kind of supplements you'd expect to be able to smell the ingredients but these have no smell. They start working within a few days of beginning them and within one week I was breathing better than I had in years. They help to clear out sinuses and keep chest clear do breathing is easier. These are a less expensive brand and are a great value for the money.
776. This blackhead remover vacuum is amazing. It has an app that you can download to access the 20x magnifying camera so that you can see it actually helping your skin. It's kind of cool to actually watch the blackheads, whiteheads and makeup particles being removed from your skin. It has great suction power. It's easy to use and takes less than three minutes to finish your entire face. It's made well and is durable and seems to be long lasting. This makes a great gift. I'm very happy with this purchase. Great value
777. The suction power of this blackhead remover is amazing. You can feel the balckheads being removed from your skin. The results after using this just a couple of times is so noticeable that you'll get compliments. It's made very durable and seems to be long lasting. It's easy to use and comes with well laid out easy to use instructions on how to use properly, care of the machine and safety information. It comes with five additional heads that are easy to change. This will help you to achieve the skin you desire. This is a great value for the money
778. This is a more realistic dildo. Its not too big and goes for more of the average size of a real one. It has a suction cup so you can use on a chair or a wall or even in the shower. Its flexible and easy to bend and maneuver whatever way you desire. Very easy to use even someone inexperienced can use this. It looks and feels so real you wont even notice it isnt real plus it doesn't come with all the drama of a male.
779. This easy to hold facial cleanser is amazing. You can put a small amount of soap for face on it and turn it on. It gives your face a cleaning massage to get deep into pores. It's made durable and made out of a high quality silicone material. It makes a great gift for anyone that likes to keep their skin looking younger and more vibrant. It has an excellent battery life , It comes with an included usb charging cable. I've charged it once in the month that I've had it. It's a great value for the money.
780. It's so much nicer to take a shower with a scrubber brush like this one. It's really soft and feels amazing. It's really easy to.hold onto even when wet. It's soft bristles provide a nice soft scrubbing massage to get derp down dirt off from skin. The ability to reach hard to reach places makes it feel like you have superhuman stretchability. Great value
781. After the birth of my two year old I am finding that my upper back is hurting more and more. My physical therapist suggested I get a posture corrector to straighten and relieve pain. This one is a great choice. Unlike other ones I have that didn't help, this one has a wide strip of stretchy fabric between the shoulder blades that fits more comfortable but still helps to align my back in place and ease pain. This one can be fastened in the front for easier ability to put on and take off. It's really comfortable and soft. Great value
782. The suction power on this blackhead remover is really good. It's very easy to use. It comes with four different attachments that are easy to put on and take off that attack different skin issues. It has enough suction power to remove blackheads on the first try but gentle enough not to cause pain. It's rechargeable and the battery life is great.  I've charged it once In almost a month and it's still going strong. This is a great skin care tool and is a great value for the money I paid.
783. These make wearing a face mask a lot more comfortable as they hold the masks off your mouth so it's easier to breathe. They are made from thick plastic that is long lasting and can be washed with soap and water or heat sanitized easily. Comes in a three pack that is well packaged and protects them from dust and dirt. They are a must have for anyone who  has difficulty breathing when wearing a mask. Great value
784. I love this toothbrush. It comes with replacement heads so this will last a while before needing to buy more replacement heads. Amazing price. Last a long time. So many different modes its easy to get the perfect brush with no issues
785. This is an amazing keto supplement. Helps burn fat fast. Great price
786. Amazing flavor. These are the best pill i have to take. Most are nasty but this one you want to take more because they taste like candy. The best DIM supplement ive tried by far.
787. This is not like the others. It has strong suction and can get you off in no time at all. Very easy to clean after. I have this straw like thing that i got to help w cleaning this. Feels very lifelike. This is the best male masturbator i have found so far. A great buy.
788. Very easy to clean. The heat feature is amazing. This works great charges fast has a remote. Love the variety of settings. A great product. The battery last a good amount of time i still havent had to charge it again and i bought it a while ago.
789. OMG this is the best thing ever. Not only is it full sized but it thrusts and at different speeds but the clit sucker is adjustable so you can have it in the perfect position for the best O. I've tried a lot of toys and none of them are anything like this one. Its very easy to clean and charge
790. This machine is amazing. It has many different attachments and gets you where you want to be. Great price too. I was going to order elsewhere and they wanted like 150 and this is way less and comes with way more. Its strong and is well worth the buy
791. Very easy to use. Very comfortable. Provides relief from pain due to slouching which most everyone does. This really helps at first we were doubtful but after using for a while it shows. My posture is way better and my back doesnt hurt as much
792. Great product i thought the bottle was glass not plastic. But i love that its not easy to break and looks very expensive. Easy to swallow.
793. Great taste. Very easy to make. Great pre workout supplement. My new favorite. I didnt really like chocolate or vanilla flavors but green apple is amazing.
794. These last about 1 hour of continual comfortable hear.  About 1 inch across.  All these types seem pricy for a Chinese product
795. Weak strength and not authentic smell
796. Use and use and use there babies.  Easy effective. See through.  Been buying for 5 years.There are so many flooding the market. This is a good one
797. Was a relief  but had to do more to get well.
798. Very strong energy from this. Amazing!
799. I believed this may help with leg cramps...not so sure.  I didn't notice any WOW effect.
800. This is prescription strength fish oil. My husband and i take it for bad cholesterol. Awsome product. ..
801. I live near a train yard.I like having a nice background noise to sleep by.The sounds are nice but i dont use all of them.I picked a favorite and that works for me.A few of the sounds are a little to 'crisp' and would be better if muffled. Or if the unit was at a distance, perhaps in the hallway.
802. Excellent product. Same quality since year 2000 to my knowledge: I have been buying this for many years at Wholefoods before bought it on Amazon. Recommended.
803. This brush bristles were way too short for me. I’m sure others may feel differently about the brush. It just wasn’t for me, so I returned this item.
804. Loved the price and product
805. It was nice that they threw in a gift of a full sized bottle of another product as well.
806. Research indicates that zinc is helpful in fighting bacterial and viral infections.  During this pandemic I’ve added it to my arsenal of supplements.  You should too!
807. Great straws. Just as described and I feel good about not buying plastic ones anymore. Especially after watching those sad sea-life videos online of plastic in the ocean. They are stylish too!
808. Bought to put in a large (36&#34; across) tub; works like a charm.
809. I had to return this item as the handle was stuck and would not come out of the case.  It was totally stuck and would not budge.  I wrote to Frank Shaving Company in China and they were not helpful. I bought another WSP Monarch Silver Tip Badger to replace the returned item.
810. Wife bought it.  Pointless.
811. Triglycerides were reduced from 309 to 169 in 12 months, taking 2 table spoons per day.  HDL went from 38 to 61. Good news for someone like me who does not want to take any meds.
812. I have been working on lowering my BP for over a yr.  Did not want to take scripts for it.  been following natural remedies and a friend suggested this as the Amish use it.  FINALLY, today my BP broke  into the 120's.  129 over 79 to be exact!  usually ran in the 190's over 90's..so I am thrilled.  will be re ordering this.
813. this is my 3-4th order, I am using it for my cats with renal issues, so far it seems to really be helpful, I just add it to the daily drinking water and all drink from it.  so the do not mind any taste if there is  one.  it dissolves easily in water.
814. Just like all the other comments that I did not listen to the liquid will never go through this tube! It won’t work.
815. My husband said he does have more energy, drinks this daily every morning.
816. I really researched this product and am sure it is the best cleaner you can use before you chalk paint
817. Would you like a real review, not a generic 3 or 4 word review like "Works great" "Would buy again" etc.? Well here it is.I was a smoker for 35 years or so. I quit last year. The years of smoking left my teeth yellow and ugly and I was ashamed to smile. So I bought this kit after I heard a radio DJ rave about it.Here is my experience:It works a little. Since my teeth are so stained, I wasn't expecting them to be snow white, but there is absolutely NO WAY that thay are 7 shades lighter lol. Maybe 2 or 3 shades, which is better but not great. The little swabs are weird. They're in a a tiny tube and you have to press your nail on a dotted line near the top, then bend back the long piece of plastic to dislodge the swab. It works about 60% of the time. I've had to cut it with scissors a few times, and one time the swab came off in the tube and it was pretty messy. But I made it work. Instructions are to rub in a circular motion on stained area for 2 minutes. Well all my teeth are yellow so they are all the "stained area". In short, I ended spending about 5-7 minutes swabbing my teeth first with the Stain Out then with the Whitening Gel.Well....my teeth do look some better, so I've ordered another kit and just started it again today. I've also been using Colgate Optic White toothpaste & mouth rinse. I'm going to be patient. It took 35 years to stain them so it would be unrealistic to think I can have them pearly white in just one week for $60.Worth a shot, just don't expect to guide ships into the harbour at night by them.
818. I have long been curious about Wen but am always leery of getting locked into automatic shipments which is what happens often when ordering from TV or a website. I found out that Sephora now sells it, so off I went to buy some. I was convinced that it was the answer for my sun-and-curling-iron-damaged hair. I bought the almond mint one there and tried it a few times; quite frankly at the time I was disappointed and returned to my regular shampoo & conditioner. Admittedly my hair was in pretty bad shape. Well, a few weeks ago I went to the salon and had about 8 inches cut off. And I tried Wen on it again and had several good hair days. I became curious about this orange blossom scent which is not available at Sephora so I ordered it...I actually buckled down and followed directions this time. It has taken some patience but I finally got the knack of how best to use it on my hair! My hair is now short in back, longer in front with bangs. The texture is medium-fine and I have a good bit of hair so it often looks thicker than it really is (humid climate plays a part in that!) First off: 10-16 pumps of this is far too much and takes forever to rinse out. The magic number for me is 5-7 pumps. Secondly, I use lukewarm, not cold water to wash and cooler water to rinse. And I do rinse well after leaving it on for the duration of my shower - this is very important as it will leave a film on my hair if I don't. Thirdly: I massage it very well into my scalp, adding a bit more water and then comb through to the ends.Both the almond mint and the orange blossom work equally well, so I know this orange blossom Wen is the real thing. My hair looks and feels better than it has in a long time; it has bounce, shine and holds a style beautifully! I now only use a tiny bit of mousse on my bangs and spray lightly with hairspray and do not need to comb or brush for the rest of the day even in high humidity. I do work outside and so the style does fall some by the end of the day but that is to be expected with an active job like mine. But the damage and dryness that had been plaguing me have all but disappeared since I have been using Wen. When I feel it creeping back, I just use the Remoist Mask by Wen and that fixes it straight away.A note on the scent: It really does not smell like orange blossoms to me, but it is pleasant with a fresh floral aroma and maybe just a hint of spice. I can still smell it faintly in my hair after blow drying whereas with the almond mint I cannot.I am really happy with this product and do not intend to ever use anything else on my hair again!
819. I can't find better words to describe how glad I am to have discovered this product than to say:  IT SAVED MY DOG'S LIFE. HALLELUJAH!!
820. company should be more careful, and research a bit more on its content. specially one ingredient that's very harmful when prolonged use.
821. I tried everything. Nothing worked. Name the probiotic. Some did nothing. Some made things worse. Antibiotics destroyed my colon. Then, of course here came the candida nightmare. What was wrong? Did I have parasites? Heavy metals causing candida? Went to the gastro doc...(colonoscopy uggg) said I am clean as a whistle.  No problems he could see. Must have IBS. I'd like to personally thank the Doctor I trusted for the constant hit from the unnecessary antibiotics. What a mess.I just stumbled on this. Pure accident. Thank you God for this product. You want to get rid of all of it? Just give this a try. I am telling you there is NOTHING else like it. Seal up those tight junctures....and heal.Update: 122916- I am taking one tablespoon on an empty stomach every morning. This stuff has completely healed all my intestinal problems. I will never be without it again. I have had a couple of cheat meals because of the holidays and they have not made me sick. Now...I will not do this regularly....I am eating clean now and I don't want to screw that up....but the little I did do... did nothing to cause me any misery. It took a long time for me to find something that would cure my IBSColitisInflammation ...this did it. I no longer care for sugar, breads or dairy with the exception of grass fed organic butter and eggs...and not every day. I don't even crave sweets anymore. I am back here right now to purchase another bottle!Go to youtube and listen to Dr Zach Bush! you wont be sorry.You wont need another probiotic.
822. I absolutely love this product. The smell is so nice and I like the fact that it’s all natural oils and no harmful chemicals. Will be purchasing again soon.
823. I have purchased Professor Amos drain cleaner for years.  It has always worked.  I may have to use more than one treatment, but it will clear your drain.
824. Good value with two brushes. I bought this for my husband. He feels the body brush bristles may be too stiff to use, but the small facial brush I will use.
825. I fell several weeks ago and hurt my seat, but, consequently, my legs hurt since then, too.  I bought this to help cushion my seat at work, but it's thick and hurts my legs on the edge.  I have to return the item because it wasn't comfortable for me.
826. Had high hopes, but made my silent acid reflux worse.  I am continually congested and have stuff in my throat, was hoping this product may have helped clear it, but no such luck.  May work for other ailments, thats why I gave it 3 stars, but no luck for silent acid refluxLPR.
827. Positives- It worked well in removing contaminates for 1 year.Negatives- There is not enough  threading that attaches the head to the handle, it is very easy to pop off the shower head when turning it for a different massage setting and very difficult to get it back on.It started leaking from the hose connections, and then a few days later the hose detached from the tubing and there is no way of reattaching it! We are handy and it just can't be done.Very disappointing to spend this $$ on a product that lasts only a year! And of course it can't be returned. So now off to try to find a better brand.
828. Love this item. Easy access for my cigars on the go.
829. I trust Garden of Life products. I love this one because their products are plant based.
830. I like this thing. Works well and am not disappointed.
831. Does the job!
832. This is an excellent product. One hundred percent non-irritating to the skin. Cleans and rinses off thoroughly. Very gentle and mild. However, it is too expensive.
833. It helps me
834. I didn't expect so many herbsThe package came in very quickly aswell. Happy buyer
835. wife loves it
836. I didn't help me with milk supply but I am still taking it for general health.I like it. Great price and good product.
837. My toddler loves flossing with these little plackers, they have animal shapes and are colorful.
838. Ok, so, I never know if the natural stuff works as I have no patience and end up taking Tylenol as well to suppress symptoms.Anyway, This past week I caught a pretty bad cold, sneezing, runny nose etc, I took this for 23 days + sudafed pe to suppress symptoms and in 2 days I felt human again, my colds usually last minimum a week to 10 days.I also took olive leaf for my throat and I think that took care of that.No natural remedy ever worked on me .... I think this is a winner so far .... Pricey, yes, but have been uing it already for months (I think it stopped a cold at the very beginning a few times) and still have some left.
839. Great product!!
840. I absolutely love this stuff. It really helps with my fatigue. The only issue is that I'm not sure if it interacts with my prescription. So I'm cutting back to only using this 3x a week and once a day. I was taking this everyday and was at 3 dropperfuls, 3x a day.When I do bw again I'll see if anything has changed.
841. I dont have any issues with this. Hopefully its helping but its one of those items where you really cant tell possibly until later. I've only been using it for about a month and a half. We'll see.
842. I love the Amla juice. I purchased it to use for my hair. It takes away the greys. I have only used henna on my hair, never any chemical dyes. The henna keeps my hair brown & the Amla juice I use as a rinse for my hair.
843. Quick ship, i love this toothpaste but its hard to find sometimes. Keep in stock and i sure will buy.
844. I was a little disappointed in the fact that the ads didn't say that there is no stopper in the top to prevent spills. I would have preferred that there was a stopper in it.
845. I really enjoy the wand.  It seems to give relief for awhile plus it has other attachments.
846. I gave a five star for this product is great. The taste is hard to get used too, but I mix it in 100% grape juice and it is very good. The juice is good for you plus the energy greens and I feel wonderful. I am 73 yrs old and I can work rings around my husband and  kids. I will continue to take the All day Energy Greens as long as I can afford it.
847. It works!
848. This is a very good product and supposed to help with keeping you sharp.  I just started using it and I do feel it makes a difference when I am not using it, even though haven't been on it very long.  I will try to do a future update once I have been using it for a month.
849. I tried several kinds, all homeopathic nasal spray for sinus.  This is probably second fav, works good but best one is “Seagate Olive Relief” for me.
850. I have chronic Lyme.  My Doc suggested this for immune system.  This stuff works!!  But it's 4 star because lactate sensitive women needs to be careful taking this. I have tried so far 18 teaspoon because I am super drug, chemical sensitive, even some herbs.  I feel still yet effectiveness from this liquid even very small dosage.  I will gradually increase dose to see how it works.  Very good stuff!!
851. just like going to the hygienist 😁
852. You have two types of people buying these bars: The insiders who have a range of expectations from Julian, and newcomers, whose reviews are all over the map. As a long-time client, buying these bars meant no erythritolstevia, no grains, no sugar, and high protein (dairy-free). My gut is somewhat sensitive to Stevia, and actually love that these guys use only Monk Fruit (a relatively scarce no-cal sweetener). One's abilities to make a tasty bar are compromised when adhering to limited ingredient lists. If you prefer other brands, it's likely because their ingredient list differs (more additives). For me personally, Julian uses exactly what I prefer and nothing else. These bars serve an important purpose and taste just fine to me.
853. This sponge does not work. I scrubbed and scrubbed but nothing came out from my skin. I just saw my skin was red from scrubbing so hard. Dont buy this item. I tossed them in the trash. What a waste!
854. This smells almost rotten, like something in it has gone bad.  I couldn't stand the smell so I threw it away and got a different brand.
855. Got them for both of my girls and they love it.
856. Good quality sweet almond.
857. Fantastic!!! Love it and will buy more of it! Arrived very carefully packaged, it came from India, took a while to arrive, no problem, worth the wait . Just great. Thank you!
858. Awesome product! Happy customer.
859. This works so well. It removes lint great but my favorite part is that it helps remove picked material. My daughter has some athletic pants that started getting fuzzing looking, this removed those little picks and balls and made the pants look new again.
860. GOBBLE GOBBLE GOBBLE : ) The BEST!!!
861. In the clouds! God Bless : )
862. Awful don't waste your money I purchased this &amp; it didn't last a full year. Everything I did to clean per instructions still will not work. I will never purchase from this company again.
863. Our chiropractor sells these pillows at her office and had encouraged me to try one after I was treated for neck pain resulting from a whiplash injury.  This was over 10 years ago and it's the only pillow I will use.  I usually buy a 3 pack and replace my pillows in less than 2 years so this is an economical way to buy them.  When I purchased my first 3 pack I had my husband try one and he liked it as well.
864. I have been using this for over 6 months and I got to tell you it's amazing.  I bought it to use to brush my teeth with.  I have gum problems they hurt and they itched all the time.  When I went to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned she had to use numbing stuff just to clean my teeth they were so sensitive and so painful.  When I returned six months later for my next cleaning she was totally amazed that my gums looked so healthy and they were not inflamed anymore and she cleaned them in half the time.  There was very little tarter build up as well.  It is so very soothing to my gums.  I don't use toothpaste anymore or mouthwash even natural stuff because this Dragon's Blood does it all.  I read that it can be put on the gum line to help keep the gums from receding.  I know it works to seal wounds and I have used it on my gums to seal them to keep particles from getting into them.  I am ordering much more now.
865. Love it ❤❤❤
866. These taste great and make us feel wonderful!  You can feel a difference.
867. Their Oreos what can be wrong
868. This daily shower cleaner is fantastic and hard to find. I have been using it for years and was thrilled I was able to order it online. It works great and was even recommended by the guy who came out to fix my shower.
869. I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it.
870. My neighbor, a beautician for over 20 years, told me to use baking soda on my hair when I wash it. I use hair spray, and she said wet your hair, sprinkle some of the baking soda onto your hand and rub it into your hair before shampooing. She said to leave it set for a bit and then shampoo and it will take out any excess hair products, that normally do not come out when doing a regular shampoo only. I find it works great. In addition, I use it in the washer for cleaner fresher clothes.
871. Longer strip works wonderfully on my MCL injury. Stays in place much better than most lidocaine patches
872. Its good but makes a big mess.
873. It's okay, but dries out easy.
874. has a horrible smell
875. This barely works. It just fit hospital issued walker. Adult son says it is usable if one is carefull. It is unstable in use. It broke in use. I was just informed of this today. I would not use this ever again. My son got a scratch from where the walker broke apart at the back side of one of the handle slots.12292018
876. Excellent bee pollen! Good to eat by the spoonful, if you can afford it. Very satisfying. If it was half the price I would add it to half my dishes!
877. It feels and looks well-made but unfortunately, it is too small. I try to attach it to my Hoover vacuum cleaner hose somewhere between 116&#34; and 18 too small leaving a gap.
878. Very nice looking and seems sturdy.
879. As a frequent traveler who is always on-the-go, these are often a lifesaver for a quick cleanse. I discovered them when they were the Unisex "Sofie's Secret" which is now the "female" version (as opposed to the male version which is the "Titan" wipes). I think the name must have put a few guys off, even though as far as I can tell the only difference is the female version has a mild citrus scent and the male version has a slightly spicy cinnamon and citrus scent. In any case, if you are always on the go and need body wipes because you can't grab a quick shower, these are the product you want to buy. Multiple baby wipes just won't cut it. I guess now that they have the marketing split between guys and gals wipes, that the guys don't have to feel bashful using them now that they are packaged like something out of a military MRE.
880. Nice product...but cover to batteries really tough to take off.  LKB.
881. Nice for my wife's back.
882. Wonderful fragrance for baby & me !
883. Easy to use
884. Fits good-comfortable-good support-easy to apply 😊😊😊
885. All of Dr Axe products are reliable.  THESE WORK.  Period.
886. I have psoriasis on my scalp. I addition to steroids drops once in a while and coal tar when it is really bad, I was using pure emu oil daily. I tried this jojoba oil to see if I could save some money, and it turned out to be better than the emu oil. Only coal tar seems to work better.
887. Everything arrived ok..looks like good quality rv toilet paper
888. Good fit !!
889. I bought to replace a broken chain. Very good for the price.
890. Does what it's supposed to I guess but now that I know you only get ONE holder instead of 4, it's a poor value.
891. For the most part, the unit functions well.  However, the instructions are written in what appear to be 0.0000000000000001 font size.  In addition, the writer obviously spoke very poor English, and the instructions were not meant for this unit.  Not sure what moron thought this was a good idea, but they have no business writing an instruction manual.
892. I wish I had sent these back immediately.  I wanted to keep an open mind and try the scent a couple times, but it was disgustingly, sickeningly sweet.  Not at all natural.  This is a purely chemical, soap-like smell.  Overpoweringly horrible.
893. Very firm,smooth, good quality.  I use as an exercise for balance.  It's supposed to strengthen leg muscles.
894. I did a lot of research before I bought this foot massager.  And I honestly don't believe I had unrealistic expectations about what to expect, but it was very disappointing. I read the material that came with it (which was very poorly written) and followed its suggestions. But I quickly came to realize I shouldn't expect a machine to do what human hands can do so much better.  Even though the massager has an abundance of custom settings, I could never find one that was gentle enough.  The foot pockets felt pretty narrow (I wear women's size 9 medium width) and there were times the massager painfully pinched the widest part of my foot if I didn't make a conscious effort to keep my feet moving out of the way.  Instead of a relaxing 15-30 minute foot massage, I ended the session more tense than when I started because I was trying to anticipate where the machine was going to squeeze next.  Wearing light socks definitely helped.  The machine is not light enough to pack around with you everywhere you go, but it's got good places to hang on to when you do need to pick it up and move it.  It arrived promptly, was packaged very well, and the machine itself feels sturdy. The remote is a flimsy little thing that isn't super effective.  You have to hold it fairly close to the machine to get it to work; I could just as easily bend over and change the settings myself. But at least the remote came with a battery so I didn't have to supply that.  I tried it for a total of five 15-30 minute sessions before deciding to put a For Sale ad in our local paper to try and recoup some of my expenditure.  Somebody else might fall in love with it.
895. Works real good
896. Great torch lighter, well constructed, feels sturdy and fits perfectly in my hand.  It is bigger than I expected which I like because it holds a lot of gas.  Easy push button, lights every time.
897. Ordered this to help with removing old boat decals from 2010. What a waste of $$$. Figured at the price it should be fantastic. Lesson learned just because it cost five or six times more does not mean it works half as good as others. Also NO REFUNDS! They do not stand by their product. Use acetone or goo be gone and save your money. Sure wish I did!!!
898. A bit expensive but well made and heavysubstantial with a nice cover. Having trouble with my hip and thisseems to help a lot both in my truck and at home in an office chair. I am happy enough that I'm going to orderthe larger my expensive cushion next.
899. I love the glitter! The mask is comfortable and light enough so it's not overwhelming. I wear it to my doctor's appointments if they are not virtual. Anywhere I need to go it is appropriate. And cute!!
900. A bit expensive but well made and heavysubstantial with a nice cover. Having trouble with my hip and thisseems to help a lot both in my truck and at home in an office chair. I am happy enough that I'm going to orderthe larger my expensive cushion next.
901. I couldn't get these things to work on my glasses, however they are a well made product
902. Good Fit.  I'm in a constant hunt for socks I like.  These are looking good so far.  After I washed these I was much happier with the fit.  They seemed a little loose when new.
903. I have a rental property that has white tile with white grout.  Needless to say the grout was pretty awful.  Sprayed this on and let it sit for a few minutes. Wiped it off with an old towel.  Will be stocking up.
904. been using for several years,  always does the job
905. Yes it is a very good product.
906. This stuff is fantastic.  We have a wood burning stove and it removes grime completely from the glass.  If you have a stove, you will be so glad you purchased this miracle soot and creosote remover for the glass.  We’ve used it for many years.
907. I have IBS. it sucks. being regular is apparently more important that i thought it would be. wtf right? anyway i take fiber gummies because of this. Theyre yummy. dont leave them in the sun though. its gummy it will melt.
908. Quality product.  Just as advertised.  Works perfectly.  Will buy from here again!
909. One day delivery, installed by daughter. Well made,works great.
910. Works great as advertised.
911. These cushion is exactly what is needed. Really good support when sitting for long periods
912. Presently, the best on the market, but get the Pro Formula as it does the job, as I have tried them all.
913. The best analgesic gel by far that contains no waxes or parabens. Caspian based ointment works better, but you have to scrub your hands thoroughly after use, but as a regular user of these ointments I can tell you the new Pro formula has put ZIM as the king of the mountain for neuropathy.
914. These are not extra wide and they are not diabetic socks. They were regular socks and Amazon is not looking at these vendors close enough.
915. This product nothing, meaning it was a waste of my money.
916. I’ve been using Kendall wipes since 2010. they are one of three that I use when changing my bag. they are gentle on the skin, however oily due to the aloe and citrus extract, so I need to use another product to ensure no  residue is left.  I’m surprised to read that someone said the pads were dry; they are saturated.I always ordered them from Edgepark, who has stopped carrying them. so I bought them here from Medville. They subbed a different product that had alcohol in it and then they wouldn’t take the mistake product back. Amazon had to step in and get my $ back. I wouldn’t ever deal with Medville again, but the Kendall adhesive remover - I can’t imagine not having it as a tool, especially if I’ve used a barrier like an Eakin Seal (sticky.)
917. I got small, and I wear a size 4 women's and size 3 child.  It was a wee big, so I haven't gained much from wearing it.
918. I have had my first pair on for about a half hour, the tops are already stretched out enough that both socks are around the top of my boots. $26 shot to h#
919. I bought this product after my doctor gave me a sample (1) to use with my scleral contact lens.  Since it took 1 tube to rinse my lens I did not try them it on the contacts.  My contacts require a lot of solution to actually remain in the contact to form a buffer over my eye.  When I tried to fill the lens (You have to use a holder) with the LacriPure the solution went all over the place.  The shape of the container is all wrong!  I ended up wasting a lot of the solution and this stuff is not cheap.  Once I finally got it into the lens and onto my eye I found that I was uncomfortable.  It is just saline solution so I blamed the contact.  After many attempts to use it, I have finally come to the conclusion it is not the product for me.  The container the solution is in is all wrong, dispensing the solution all over the place, and there is something in the solution that does not work with my lens even though it is made for my type of lens.  I have wasted 37.00 on this product and can't return because it is past the 30 days.  I use AddiPak instead and find it cheaper and works wonderful.  Don't waste your money on this product.
920. I could not get this guard to work.  I boiled it a second time when I got it too tight the first time and it still didn't work.  It was not cheap either.
921. They make my arches feel better. Feet hurt less
922. worked out as exspected
923. I have always chewed garlic when I feel like I am about to get sick because it has immune-boosting properties; however, it is not practical to keep garlic cloves in my bag. This product works great because it has the same effect of boosting my immune system but it stays fresh for a long time and is easy to take. I don't notice any bad taste or after effects. I would recommend this to anyone!
924. This is an excellent product with great health benefits. Here is what it does if you are unfamiliar with it:How Forskolin WorksForskolin acts primarily by activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which results in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cells. Cyclic AMP belongs to a class of substances known as &#34;second messengers&#34; and is one of the most important cell-regulating compounds. Among its many roles, cAMP activates numerous other enzymes involved in diverse cellular functions. Hormones and neurotransmitters also activate adenylate cyclase, but Forskolin appears to be able to activate adenylate cyclase by itself. Thus, Forskolin can increase cyclic AMP without the assistance of hormones or neurotransmitters.Effects of Cyclic AMPPIncreased cellular cyclic AMP results in a broad range of physiological and biochemical effects, including inhibition of platelet activation (resulting in decreased likelihood of blood clots), reduced release of histamine (resulting in decreased allergy symptoms), increased force of contraction of the heart, relaxation of the arteries and other smooth muscles, increased thyroid function, and increased lipolysis (fat burning).A number of diseases are characterized, in part, by decreased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. These include asthma, eczema, psoriasis, angina, obesity and hypertension. In addition to its adenylyl cyclase-stimulating actions, Forskolin also appears to have actions that are not due to this mechanism, but are due to its ability to alter a number of membrane transport proteins.Asthma and AllergiesMany drugs used to treat asthma and allergies are designed to increase cAMP levels. Usually they inhibit the enzyme (phosphodiesterase) that breaks down cAMP. This mechanism is the &#34;flip side&#34; of Forskolin’s ability to act directly to increase cAMP. Thus, Forskolin can be used by itself, or in addition to phosphodiesterase-inhibiting drugs in the prevention and treatment of many allergic conditions, including asthma.Forskolin is an effective smooth-muscle relaxer, resulting in bronchodilation, decreased airway resistance, and increased vital capacity and forced expiratory volume, which are important indicators of pulmonary function. Forskolin also has tremendous antispasmodic action on various smooth muscles in the body, making it useful to relieve intestinal colic, uterine cramps, painful urination, angina, and hypertension.Cardiovascular Effects of ForskolinColeus forskohli has traditionally been used to treat hypertension, congestive heart failure, and angina. Treating these conditions may be among the most useful uses for Forskolin. Forskolin's basic cardiovascular action is to lower blood pressure, while simultaneously increasing the contractility of the heart. This is believed to be due to Forskolin's cAMP-elevating ability, which results in relaxation of the arteries, and increased force of contraction of the heart muscle. One study involved seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a particularly difficult condition to treat. Forskolin administration dramatically improved left ventricular function and overall cardiovascular performance.Forskolin also increases cerebral blood flow, indicating that it may be beneficial in cerebral vascular insufficiency and in enhancing post-stroke recovery. The platelet aggregation-inhibiting effects of Forskolin also add to its value in cardiovascular disorders.Glaucoma and Increased Intraocular PressureGlaucoma is a cause of visual loss characterized by nerve damage (usually associated with increased intraocular pressure), loss of visual field, glare, and sometimes pain. It is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. Unfortunately, there is very little in the armamentarium of alternative health care practitioners that is effective in preventing or treating this poorly understood condition. However, a number of studies have shown that topical application of one percent Forskolin eye drops resulted in significant decreases in intraocular pressure for up to five hours. Researchers believe that it is the cAMP-elevating effects of Forskolin that result in this significant improvement. Unfortunately, no commercial Forskolin eye drops have been developed at this time. Although clinical experience is limited, oral Forskolin appears to offer significant potential for sufferers of glaucoma or intraocular hypertension, and may be a major advance in the non-drug treatment of this condition.PsoriasisPsoriasis is characterized by a relative decrease in cAMP compared to another second messenger, cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP). This imbalance results in a tremendous increase in cell division. In psoriasis, cells divide about 1,000 times faster than normal. Forskolin helps to alleviate psoriasis by normalizing the cAMP cGMP ratio. It should be noted that Fumaric Acid, by itself, is highly effective in the prevention and treatment of psoriasis. However, Forskolin and Evening Primrose Oil may both be considered as additional substances to be added to a regimen to treat this particularly vexatious disease.DepressionDepression is believed to be due to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain—most commonly either serotonergic (inhibitory) or dopaminergic (stimulatory). The response to various antidepressants depends on which neurotransmitter system has deviated farthest from the &#34;norm.&#34; If the serotonergic neurotransmitters are most deficient, serotonin precursors like 5-HTP or L-tryptophan, or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) like Paxil, Prozac, or Zoloft are most likely to be of help. If the dopaminergic (i.e., catecholamines like epinephrine or noradrenaline) neurotransmitters are deficient, catecholamine precursors such as the amino acids L-Phenylalanine or L-Tyrosine, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as GeroVital (GH3) or Deprenyl are most likely to help.German scientists have been working with a different approach to elevating catecholamines, using a class of drugs that stimulate both the presynaptic as well as the postsynaptic components of catecholamanergic transmission. This novel approach uses a drug, Rolipram, which acts by increasing cAMP (an action similar to that of Forskolin), and inhibiting phosphodiesterase. Although the researchers stopped short of recommending Forskolin for the treatment of depression, they stated clearly that &#34;elevated brain cAMP levels are closely linked to antidepressant activity in animal models of depression.&#34;Weight LossIn vitro studies show that Forskolin stimulates lipolysis (breaking down of fats) in fat cells. Additionally, scientists at the Penn State University College of Medicine have found that many obese people have lower than normal cAMP production. Based on these findings and in vitro studies, scientists theorized that Forskolin might be an effective weight loss agent, especially for those with impaired cAMP production. A recent small study appeared to confirm this conjecture. Six overweight women took 25 mg of Forskolin (250 mg capsules of 10 percent standardized Forskolin extract) twice daily for eight weeks. At the end of the eight-week trial, the participants lost a mean of ten pounds, and reduced their percentage of body fat by nearly 8 percent. Blood pressure levels also trended lower during the trial. These preliminary results indicate that Forskolin may be a safe, useful adjunct to losing weight and maintaining normal body composition.HypothyroidismForskolin also has demonstrated the ability to increase thyroid hormone production and stimulate thyroid hormone release. This mechanism of stimulating the thyroid to enhance metabolism may be one way in which Forskolin promotes normal body weight. Forskolin's effects in normalizing thyroid function may also contribute to its antidepressant effects, as depression is a common feature of hypothyroidism.Cancer MetastasesScientists at Brown University confirmed that Forskolin is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, as well as being a potent inhibitor of tumor colonization in mice. They suggested that Forskolin could find a place in the prevention of tumor metastases.Immune EnhancementForskolin also exhibits potent immune system enhancement by activating macrophages and lymphocytes.DosageBased on the human studies for weight loss, 50 to 100 mg of Forskolin taken in divided doses during the day appears to be a safe, effective dose for the conditions discussed above.
925. my husband wears them to bed every night
926. This mask is absolutely fantastic. Only problem I have is I've ordered 3 WHITE masks and have received 3 BLACK masks. The package even says WHITE. I'm not returning the black ones. But who ever packages them, should know.
927. This mask is awesome, exactly what I wanted
928. My son has chafing issues and this fixed his problem. Desitin is very messy but this stuff dries and helps the skin glide when rubbing together. He hasn't had pain ever since I bought this.
929. My husband is having problems with swallowing larger pills - he does not have difficulty with gummies so these are working well.
930. Small - cord is short - too small to use in bed - pad did not work
931. Been using this brand and style for years. Never too tight or too loose. Always just right and I wear my CircAides right over them. (Can’t stand compression socks over my feet.)
932. I had COVID, my taste & smell ability was impacted and I had huge drainage from my sinuses. ICK.  No other mouthwash got the bad taste out of my mouth and kept the bad taste away. It also helped my sore throat. Now I’m better and I’m not going back to any other mouthwash.
933. The straps in front are too wide. They irritate and rub against my upper arm.  Making it impossible to wear in comfort.  Also came with a warning to wear for just a few hours.  Who wants to undress at work ?
934. I wear these at the gun range. They do OK.
935. The mask is comfortably soft. The ear loops do not hurt. It fits me perfectly and I think I have the average facial size. The only downside is my sweat pools inside the mask. One could still consider that a plus if one wants a lack of breathability. Reasonably-priced and I am glad I recognized the photo of the house where the package was delivered, my neighbor's house, so I went over to pick it up myself.
936. My knees feel great!
937. Adequate for a product made in China. 13 life expectancy of original cane tips made in U.S.A.
938. These liners are best if your boots do not have fur inside, otherwise they will not fit inside without bunching. They keep the cold out very well.
939. Fits perfectly
940. I got this for my husband because it has a 550 lb weight capacity so I figured it would be pretty durable. When it arrived, I assembled it and sat on it to try it out. One of the wheels immediately broke… and I am nowhere close to 550 lbs!  I tried to return it but amazon referred me to the manufacturer. The link they provided just took me to the sales website. The phone number rang to a message service. I bought my own set of replacement wheels and it’s working out ok now.
941. Seriously, I love this thing.  I hate washing and fixing my hair because it takes forever as I have very thick wavy hair that holds moisture.  It takes me at least an hour to blow dry (usually still damp at the back of my scalp) and straighten my hair.  I've taken to using dry shampoo for 3 and 4 days to avoid washing and doing the process all over again.  Well, this brush solves all my problems.  The day after I got it I took a shower at night letting my hair air dry a little bit before bed.  When I woke the next morning it was pretty gnarly looking (think Janis Joplin). I sprayed it with my heat protectant and hit it with the blowdryer for roughly 5 minutes just to make sure it was completely dry (that underneath layer was still damp).  I cranked the brush up to 450F while I was blow drying and she was ready by the time I was done.  I brushed my hair thoroughly to make sure there were no knots to snag.  Then the miraculous occurred, I think I heard a heavenly choir singing.  I slowly brushed the first section of my hair.  There was no strange pulling, no scalding piece of hair to hold, no weird kinks against my scalp but it was straight!  Oh wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles!  I did one side and then decided I needed to document this process.  I went and got dressed (must wear a bra for the public good) and grabbed my phone to take a few pictures.  I started with the brush at 7:08 and (with wardrobe changes and selfies) I ended at 7:22.  Say what!?!  This brush is my new best friend.  I didn't get any finger burns from lava hot hair, I even picked out a few stray hairs from the brush while it was on and it didn't burn me (what is this sorcery!).  This brush is amazing and I kind of want to kiss it.  If I never buy another hair appliance again I will be totally ok with that.  I love this thing almost as much as I love my first kindle.
942. I would purchase again!
943. Flexible but durable shoe horn, I keep one in my car for quick shoe changes
944. Great taste! Thanks.
945. Works as expected
946. My husband says these are his most comfortable socks. They are thick like boot socks, and stretchy and non-binding. They don't leave dents in his calves and they stay up.
947. You have to be patient, you will not get long lasting results overnight. Consistent use over a long period of time will get you results. Very short term results can be had immediately but after removal, the nipple will return to its normal size in a bit.Some tips: Be gentle when twisting to apply suction, if you overdo it you can break the top thin plate on the spindle.Use a lubricant, like Burt's Bees Moisturizing Lip Balm. Apply to both the areola and the nipple. It will help create a better seal and moisture the tissue.Don't rush things, applying too much suction can cause blisters andplasma leakage. Start with low suction and short application time. Increasing each in increments. If you increase the suction, consider decreasing the application time and then begin increasing the application time until you increase the amount of suction.
948. Great for toenails
949. Solid, built!!  I wish the handle was a little longer.
950. The cords are very nice but the tool they give you to help install them was not easy to use.
951. Before purchasing this, I already made peace with thinking it'd produce even a little bit of smoke, but it doesn't!Sai atomizer + Smoke Buddy = No smokeodor. It's surreal.
952. This thing is tuff
953. The brush is baby soft. It does the job, but not quite what I had hoped.
954. Have purchased several times
955. Good but bitter
956. My husband likes these they run wider and feel more comfortable
957. These help the bursitis in the elbows because they prevent you from accidentally hitting your elbow and feeling the pain.
958. I did not find that these forearm sleeves had compression. They were very loose and baggy on my forearms. Might be better for a bigger arm, but for me not useful and I had to return.
959. It is a very good concept that could work for adults that work at a desk with their water bottle next to them. But even though, they need to be vigilant as the device only blinks once - and if they miss it and do not drink, the device eventually shut down !I think it should be refined at least with repeated blinking when the first blink is missed - or perhaps it should be a warning bip sound instead of the first blink, followed by repeated blinking after a while if the is missed.This does not  work for children.
960. These are a lightweight sock for summer, do not bind at top and are nice looking ribbed socks. They stretch very well so they are good for people with edema or sensitive skin issues. My Dad's caregivers asked me to order more of these great socks for him!  (and I have tried several other kindsbrandsmaterials!
961. very forest aroma, outdoor pine fresh.
962. I'm never misplacing my mask; it's always around my neck.  Only problem is that it's really not one size fits all; there should be a small and a large.
963. It’s not like the old white pearl drops.
964. I was amazed at it's performance, but I decided not to buy it instead something else, no biggy
965. Used to come in a nice jar. Luckily I saved it. Product quality appears to be the same.
966. Well, unlike some reviewers I guess I'm just out of luck.  Use it twice a day and after a month, zero lightening of the darkbruised areas I'm using it on.  The moisturizing aspect of it is also short lived compared to others I've used.  Might work for some but after I use up this (expensive) bottle, I don't see myself buying it again.
967. Got these for my Sister who relies on those cheapo dollar store things, and you'd have thought I sent her a bad of gold, her reaction was so great on these.  She says they are super well built and optically obviously superior over what she's been using - and has had a couple of compliments on the way they look too.
968. If you're applyingwearing acrylics (or have something like horse hoofs on the ends of your fingers), this brand may be useful. These are not nice, gentle finishing buffer - they remove nail material! I'll admit, I don't have especially great nails. They tend to be a bit thin and weak, so I try to take care of them with regular manicures. In between visits, I was doing a quick touch-up; by the time I got the smooth finish I was looking for, I could feel my nail sort of pulling up at the tip and away from the nail bed. Maybe I got overly aggressive with it, but this wasn't my first nail-buffing rodeo! Be careful.
969. Works well on curling short hair
970. I got this for my wife she’s in beauty school she loves it, she is very happy with it!
971. I’m in beauty school I get this for my kit, now my classmates want me to order them some of the same wands for them. When they saw me use it they went crazy and wanted to use it when I was done styling a client. It’s amazing and the price is out of this world and it’s a beautiful wand.
972. This is quality product, but it won't dissolve in water. The best way I've found to use it is to put it in a smoothie. That also kind of wasted because it sticks to the sides of the glass. I doubt I'll buy this again unless it comes in a truly powdered form. It's too expensive for me to waste like this.
973. As someone with sensory issues and needing motivation to clean anyway, these gloves worked well. Pacific PPE's 2-pack of household gloves are unlined and a bit thin, and this pair was sized large. They ran very large, particularly for my medium hands.They were perfect for bathroom cleaning. They are quite long and came above my hoodie sleeves enough to protect them but also so that I didn't have to worry about pushing my sleeves up. My gripe about most gloves is they aren't long enough, so fluids get into them anyway. Didn't happen at all with these gloves. They were protective from cleaning chemicals and water.They are quite thin, so I wonder how long before one tears. Likewise, not knowing much about this material, I wonder if they will  become brittle over time, particularly from chemical contact.In all they are great gloves and worth every dime.
974. I have never had noni fruit, so this powder was my introduction to it. The flavor is mild when mixed into a beverage or smoothie, and for its many health benefits seems to be a good thing. I have some concerns around using it often, as it can impact kidneys. Other than that, If like to try other forms of this fruit. This powder is very affordable as a quick add-in supplement.
975. I was kind of skeptical about buying something online that I've never smelled before, but I am SO happy I purchased this.  It smells incredible! It's a nice pretty pink color and made my skin so silky feeling!
976. It is difficult to keep your teeth dry to put on the whitener.
977. Big fat elastic ninjas to teach Hookes law in physics.  Good quality.  Huge hit with students.
978. A positive difference noticed within the first day of use.
979. The expiration date is a month from now and it was produced 2yrs ago. Charcoal is ok. It smokes a lot and smells. Not very high quality.
980. Very flimsy. I did think there was going to be a top to these, but there wasn't. The slots are also smaller than I thought.
981. Absolutely love puffs plus tissue. Don’t run out auto delivery!!! Especially this time of year can’t beat this deal!!
982. Will see If the duration was worth the investment. Product works - just need to determine cost.
983. Great (6) pack👍🏽Gets (5) ⭐️
984. It was very helpful for pain associated with TMJ.
985. The scent is not strong enough
986. excellent product - thank you for the fast service
987. excellent product - thank you for the fast service
988. Love these!!! Third time around buying! It’s hard to find good bath bombs at this price — here they are!
989. I have a leather club chair that I just love. I also have five dogs, one of whom is a big, active Pittie who LOVES that chair. She sits in it all day to look outside. She also takes running leaps into the chair which causes it to careen across the room into the wall. Just about every time. The leather was getting scratched and borderline cracked, like if I hadn’t done something to those cracks forming, the leather would have just split open in a BUNCH of places.First I wiped the chair down with a clean wet rag, then I took a little bit of this in my hands and warmed it up, then I applied it with my hands all over the leather. I rubbed it in thoroughly, and after 15-20 minutes, I bugged it with a clean dry cloth. Omg, it looks AMAZING. You can still see the (almost) crack, but now that it isn’t all dried out anymore it just looks worn in and distressed, but no longer trashed.I definitely recommend this stuff. It was so quick and easy to apply with just my hands, and it only takes a teeny tiny amount, so this will last forever. I’m about to go condition my Timberland boots with it right now and can’t wait to see the results (that same dog has trashed my boots - I won’t even tell you what she did to those because ICK). Side note, that same dog licked the chair after I was done, and she is still with us, so it’s a very dog friendlysafe product.
990. No dislike at all. Love the toothpaste
991. Worked great.  Would recommend this.
992. This product is great, especially for the price!!  It’s easy to use and my baby girl doesn’t mind it at all!
993. We love this type of tissues! It’s super soft and we go through them like crazy. It’s great to be able to buy them in bulk for a great price.
994. love this for tender aching feet. big enough not to spill over
995. Love it. Lots of complements!
996. Not my fav cleaner preferred the original item much better.
997. Very deceiving as there was nothing stating that they would poorly paint rubber and glue it to mediocre glass.
998. Like Kleenex better than puffs.
999. Started using March 25, 2015 so don't know how it is working yet.
1000. Works like Comet should!
