1. Bought this for my disabled son I tried it first and liked it so much that I ordered one for myself. Finally a brush that works.
2. i mean its a working scale. works great. looks nice in comparison to my crusty bathroom. love that
3. My mom love it been using for 30yrs
4. This lavender essential oil already has 102 reviews with a high star rating so I doubt I can add anything unique to say about it.  It has a lovely lavender scent and I will be using this to scent my hand made soaps.
5. These are sturdy, lomg lasting arch and heel supports. They are firm but with some give. Have a high heel and higher arch supports. The only inserts I'll use for preventing heel pain and supporting my unusually high arches.
6. I have 3 large dogs and it can some times be a chore to brush their teeth every morning.  However, with this full surround finger toothbrush, brushing is so much easier and faster.  My dogs don't seem to fight me as much as when I was using the regular toothbrushes or the other finger brushes.  One of my dogs, she's the youngest at 16 mos. old almost seems to enjoy her morning brushing.  This toothbrush is really soft (extra soft), which is my 1 concern.  I wish the bristles where a little less soft. Sometimes I wonder if their teeth are really getting a good cleaning because the brush is so soft.  It's great to massage their gums.  This brush has made a world of difference for my dogs.  They let me brush their teeth.  Its great!
7. Easy to use and wash nicely. Love having the supply of these to grab and go.
8. I purchased this because I recently started taking online classes again and I will be spending more time in my desk chair. Poor body mechanics can cause back pain, breakdown of joints etc. This cushion was just what I needed to help me obtain good posture and prevent a sore booty.
9. Sometimes we often need a fork and don’t want to have to wash one up.Weighing the disposable factor against the use of water and soap for ONE fork is sometimes stressful.These forks eliminate that. 100% compostable and disposable.These are more like the “salad” size fork, but could be for smaller kids who can’t yet manage a bigger fork.Durable and better for the environment.Pretty happy with these and I know they’ll last a long time in my house. In the event I need to get more – I’ll definitely get these!FYI: The bigger fork is from a different set. These are the forks on the right.
10. Cute Christmas-themed cover with invisible zipper that will fit any standard cushion and liven up the living room. It's soft to touch and kids love it. It's a nice fun splash of color.
11. Great for nails
12. It's the real deal love it
13. Simple shoe brush.  Works as expected. nice cover flap
14. My husband's nice prescription glasses lost one of their nose pieces and we didn't want to go back to the eye doctor so I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  They were the perfect replacement for the one he lost and are exactly the same quality as those that came from an optical dispensary.  There are enough in this package, that I probably won't ever have to buy another pair.
15. Bulk Supplements are the best I've found! I have been doing ALOT of research on supplements and I love this company for a few reasons, mostly the purity of the products, no fillers on what I have gotten, and the price is affordable so I am more happy to try new items. I started researching these items for my cats. Glucosamine helps cats bladder tissue rebuild. The Chondrotin helps prevent damage to the bladder lining.  I only use this company for my cats because their systems are so delicate and having the supplements in powder form helps with dosing and the purity is a great bonus! Now I am trying new supplements for myself and I have this company to thank! I will be a life time buyer!
16. This product was very easy to put together and I love that I can use my own floor product. It sprayed nicely and evenly and didn’t leak. The pad secured nicely to the base with Velcro and you can throw the pads in the wash. It is as pictured and does a nice job.
17. This snack is really delicious and it’s packed full of energy
18. I do not like nuts, so hard to find a protien bar wo them. These taste good and are very filling....surprising for how tiny they are. Company stuck some extra samples in the box which was nice (hubby had to eat the nut one). The lemon was great and I will order it next.
19. Great prank gift
20. These are SOOOOOOOO tiny and cute and great size for travel, but REALLY hard to dispense from. I filled one each with lavender, peppermint, frankincense, Purify, Serenity, Sunny Citrus, and tea tree. NONE of them would dispense even one drop. I had to shake, shake, shake (you don't get a very accurate portion that way), and sometimes I'd see a film develop on the water of my travel diffuser so I knew *something* had come out. But what a pain!!! No drops.  I'm at a loss for how to actually use the oils from these little jars. You can't use a dropper unless you use separate ones for each oil (and of course take off the reducer), otherwise you'll contaminatemix due to residue of each oil in the dropper., and who is going to carry around 8 droppers? How do you get these to work??? Suggestions?
21. Battery connection is.....delicate. Be gentle
22. All three of these broke with minimal ease of use within minutes.  DO NOT BUY!!! I paid $10 for pure trash!
23. I almost wish someone I knew would have a birthday soon just to have an excuse to gift one of these bags! I ordered the "all occasion" bags with balloons and it was much better than pictured - the material is sturdy, better than your typical gift bag found at a 99 cent store and quite attractive. It doesn't say "Happy Birthday" but it seems the holiday best suited for using these bags, though the bag could also be used for promotions, graduation gifts, and anything celebratory. Note that the handles (looking like shoelaces) are packaged separately and you have to insert them by hand into each one. I found this to be a little bit of a pain but I guess it made it easier to ship. Overall I'm happy with it.
24. i love this, have it at the head of my bed, and i use it every single night. it blocks out noise.
25. Hair drags, concerned about damageDoesn't heat hot enoughDon't buy
26. Tastes yummy and it's good for you. I'm lactose intolerant so I cannot drink other protein drinks. I'm addicted to caffeine and coffee tasting products
27. Excellent for allergies. Unlike the the over-the-counter meds, these herbs have no side effects.
28. Not the best but good for the money.
29. As a healthcare worker I wear masks 14+ hours. The straps dig in my ears causing blisters. A N95 mask would be better but all we get all the thin disposable masks.These strap extenders take the straps off the ears. The silicone extender is barely noticeable. Finally my ears are getting some relief.
30. i paid more money than i want to admit for a custom acrylic tub in a 35 year old bathroom.  it can only be cleaned with vinegar.  yeh.  so this hella expensive tub is a pain... until i got these magic erasers. oh em gee, the scum just rolls off the tub and it looks brand new.  i do not know how i would keep it clean without them because vinegar is a great cleaner and i use it a lot, but you need something to &#34;scrub&#34; with that won't scratch.  voila!
31. These are perfect for home manicures.
32. I's pretty good stuff and will buy again.  Thank You!!
33. I got the giggles as this thing made my daughter’s hair and scalp quite literally “squeaky” clean! Her hair is insanely thick, but very fine, and also long. We’ve been battling dandruff for years, and tried everything. This has been a terrific help, and it somehow doesn’t tangle her hair in the process! I’m absolutely stoked on this thing, and so grateful I stumbled across it.
34. Came leaky
35. This was fine except for two things:1.  It's thicker than I thought.  It would not fit in the side pocket of my purse.2.  The one I received, the top open too easily.  Just a baby bump against the closure and out popped all of my pills.So I returned this item.
36. as expected fresh product date perfect
37. I'm sorry but I just could't manage to make this fit in my ear well enough to block sound as designed, despite repeated attempts.
38. Good price and work very well
39. Works well but I don't get why they are using glass which breaks easily and is dangerous especially when u consider that most of us will stand on it barefootedweigh ourselves naked etc. Surely luciteacrylic would make more sense..
40. Originally I thought these files would work just like my crystal nail file from Perfect Formula, a file I have had for years. My nails were all finally strong, healthy and grown out.After using these files my nails are shredding, peeling and down to the nubs! Several of the top layers of my nails are peeling back even further. Some nails have 2, 3 & 4 cracks up the nail. I just had a horribly painful crack and it tore to the skin.I thought all these crystal nail files would be the same, but they are not!
41. This is the 2nd one I've bought. I purchased this because it was dual voltage and we were headed to Ireland. I used it at home and I really liked the hot brush but the flat iron not so much....the plates don't touch. When I used it in Ireland the digital temp display got really hot, burned out and stopped working. I was about to throw it out and tried one more time to use it and the brush got hot but no digital temp display. I used it for the rest of our trip but when we got home it wouldn't turn on. :( So I ordered another because it really does cut down on my styling time. People mention the problem with the button placement but you can lock the temp by double clicking the offon button a couple of times once it reaches the temp you want!
42. The awesome and perfect cloth mask. Here’s my longest review ever and why this is the awesome PPE for me.We have several other masks cloth and disposable masks to compare these masks against. I must tell everyone these masks rock!Seriously, this mask is soft. Soft like a high quality, tight woven, brushed cotton, and soft t-shirt that feels so good I can’t wait for it to be washed.Made in the USA by Americans look up their website!I don’t know them but I know where they are and they stopped production and are only making face masks..The mask has adjustable ear loops, a pouch for inserts like those charcoal filters if you so choose.The mask is so comfortable. But, here are more reasons why I will wear this mask every time I can because of a unique feature of the strap that goes behind my head, furthermore not putting pressure on my head or neck, simply rests on my back so I can take the mask off when safe and it simply hangs on my chest or lower. No longer having to put it In the visor, risk it touching anything but my shirt. Period. I don’t have to look for it when I get out of the truck or put it in the pocket my phone was in, as cellphones are nasty even though you clean them, because I simply raise my mask up by the ear loops and slip it on my ears and snug the strap if it’s loose. Double layer full coverage mask. From bridge of my nose to under my chin. Comfortable all day! I don’t use the carbon filters. If needed, I would  put a disposable mask in the pocket area on a as necessary basis.I don’t think I have been so excited about a product since my first boom box. Just kidding; since my iPhone.These comes in two different sizes. I wear the XL. I have wide cheek bones and I’m chubby. My spouse wears the Large and has a narrower jawline shaped face and chubby.Thank you Buttonsmith for your part in helping with Covid-19 by producing more comfortable PPE. It’s hard enough as it is.Lastly, mine were shipped out a bit faster than expected.I ordered more
43. The yellow shelf fell apart in my hand as I was trying to install it.  As I tightened the wingnut, it unscrewed itself from the wood.  I'll need to get some glue and see if that will fix it.
44. Not just this one but others that I tried just do not work when training a puppy.  On this one.  I cleaned the pee spot and sprayed it on.  Puppy went back to the spot and peed next to it.  It would be funny if I wasn't peeved.
45. I have spent years making homemade bread for my family and one of my most important tools has been a plastic dough scraper I got from a King Arthur seminar several years ago. Without explanation, my scraper simply disappeared without a trace and no one knows what happened to it (I think it got tossed in the trash by accident). I went about finding a replacement and after looking at a number of products I chose this one based on the price and the positive reviews. It has proven to be a good tool, a little different than my old scraper but still fine for my needs.Instead of plastic, this one is stainless steel encased in silicone. There are a couple of important factors here. First, because of the silicone shell the scraping edge is soft and pliable. This is helpful for scraping around crevices and getting as much dough from a round plastic bowl as possible.  Because of the stainless steel inside, the whole is stiff though still slightly bendable which allows it to flex just enough to clean the bowl of my stand mixer without fatigue or permanently getting warped or bent. It is stiffer than my old plastic scraper, and while this is a positive thing it does require getting used to it.Unlike my old plastic scraper, this one will work on a hot saucepan. That’s good news for when I am making candy and don’t want to wait for the syrup to cool and harden, requiring a lot more effort to remove. I did not find any statement regarding the temperature limit for this scraper but based on other silicone utensils I have it is probably safe up to around 400 degrees F.And...silicone is more non-stick than plastic so clean-up is a little easier. It was never bad with with my plastic scraper, but it did require a bit more effort than this new scraper just because of the nature of the materials of each.I’m very pleased with this scraper. It meets the need I had and it is better than my old plastic scraper that I used for years. It works well, it can be used on hot or cold cookware and it is very easy to clean. It’s reasonably priced too. Based on my experience, this is a very easy product to recommend.
46. Wow, I wasn't expecting this dual sided silicone body brush to be as amazing as it is. I use the same amount of body wash as usual, and lots of soft foam is produced. The bristles are soft, but very effective (even if they don't feel that way at first!) The other side is nubby and works nicely for feet, knees, etc. It's a little heavy, but not overly. Dries quickly, and I can even sanitize it!
47. Tried the detox via the ion foot bath at a friends house. They had a very expensive machine. Being cheap, I looked at various machines and settled on this one. Works like a champ and glad I bought it. Because of the 5 yr warranty and being stateside was the clincher. Have used it many times on a regular basis. 2 days on and one off. Easy instructions, cant go wrong. I threw in ton of salt to see what would happen alarm went off and reset it. Use very little salt. Great product and fast delivery. Worth it.
48. Bought it for my father in law to help with the cancer and it irritated his skin. Must find right portion to use maybe?
49. Steaming veggies in bags is absolutely the way to go to get perfectly steamed veggies in less than a couple minutes.  You just stick the veggies in the bag, unzip the adhesive area, flip the flap over, toss in the microwave, and cook for the time you want to get the veggies as you like them.  Example, I like asparagus still slightly firm.  I can cook 12 pound in these in about 2 minutes, tops.  Follow their time instructions and tinker a bit to get veggies the way you like them.  No pots, no steamer devices, no mess.  I'm your basic guy who doesn't like to cook.  These are perfect.
50. Generic brand of Vaseline. Seems to be identical to name brand. Multipurpose and handy to have on hand. I have tried one other product from Solimo, a spray sunscreen, and have been very happy with it. Seems to be a quality line of products.
51. This does what it’s supposed to . It holds my mask in place securely without hurting my ears.
52. For some reason the pharmacy we use dispenses our medicines in adult proof packaging. After a real struggle, we take the pills out of that and put them into these little bottles. We peel the labels off the pharmacy bottles or paper cartons and tape them to these.. The lids are easy to open, but stay shut in a pocket or purse. I would not recommend if you have children or grandchildren around.
53. Returned!  Small and cheap!
54. Too many wild designs rather 10 of solid colors
55. Love their products
56. I found this mouth guard several years ago and have been a fan ever since.  I hated the expensive ones the dentist made as well as the boil and fit ones in the drug store.  This mouth guard is comfortable, you hardly know it is there.  It does the job.  I highly recommend it.  Mine last about a year.
57. The Ingredients of this fish oil is great! It works great for me and I heard it’s great for lower cholesterol.
58. I use this and nonstick pads instead of Band-Aids. I have bad reactions to the adhesives on Band-Aids and this tape saves me everytime. Easy to cut the shape you need.
59. Has a point not normally found on carbide files
60. These are cute and my son loves them…I just wish there was more option in style (like Mario or Luigi on the bandaids, not just the &#34;enemies&#34; and more than 20 bandaids in the package.
61. I consume this in smoothies and it is easily blendable. 1 serving is a small scoop, around a tsp size, so it really lasts. That said, in that small amount you are getting a supplement highly enriched in the daily value of Vitamin A and B. It is a cracked cell wall form, so the nutrients are bioavailable. I didn't expect it to taste very good, so I try to hide the flavor with fruits for example, but it still kind of tastes like I am drinking a vitamin.
62. I work in the yard a lot, esp this time of year and my feet would start aching. Started using Blue Emu Foot Therapy cream and I now have no issues.  Also, this cream smooths out the slight cracks in my heels.
63. I'm not totally sure this is helping. This whole pandemic thing has messed with everything but the fact that these are a capsule instead of a powder is a winner for me. I can't stand the taste of most of those things and just that alone is a turn off. I was totally skeptical but while I'm not sure how much of a benefit they are, I can say that they haven't caused any negatives so that alone makes them worth a try.
64. I won't buy this again. For $62 a bottle, there's no way this shouldn't be organic....  I would buy it again if it was
65. This is the perfect item for those whose vision is impaired.  My step-mom has macular degeneration and this was ez for her to operate.
66. These work well. Inflation is easy and completely adjustable.
67. The convience , the durability , makes things faster in shower getting ready for work !!!
68. This is THE pill case! I have used lots of these things over the years and this one is IT. The rainbow coloring is so cheerful first off. Who wants a boring old pill container when you can have these beautiful colors to look forward to every morning and evening? Not me! Give me a rainbow any day to make popping that fish oil a bit more pleasurable. Speaking of fish oil, this container is HUGE. You can fit a lot of pills in each compartment so you can go to town with your vitamin gobbling without worrying about running out of space. The tops of each pill container pop up nicely with the little levers and the whole thing is like a transformer. You can take off one day, or two, or whatever for traveling and leave the rest at home. Very happy with this purchase.
69. These are some of the best protein bars I've ever had. Delicious and no chemical aftertaste. Every flavor is great but the white chocolate cookie is my favorite.
70. The price on these is too high. They work somewhat as intended but are more likely to be worth about $2.
71. I received this 2 weeks ago and it was very good.  I open (and close) it 3 times a day.  The hinge is already noticeably loose.  I don't expect it to last long.
72. Very good product that helps reduce symptoms when it's impossible to avoid all high histamine foods every day. I appreciate being able to get two bottles at a time bc sometimes I need more than 1 bottle a month. Sometimes you need two caps a day, not just one.
73. They are beautiful and exactly like pic
74. Handle is very wobbly and the manufacturer will not all returns
75. No, I don't have a baby.  I have wicked dry skin that's also sensitive, so I thought I'd give this a shot.  And it works.  I smooth it on in the shower, pat dry, and my skin feels so much better.  It's got a very mild scent which is not at all offensive, and it's easy to apply.  I wish it was a bit cheaper, and that's the reason it's only four stars instead of five.  But it's a good product so I suppose it's worth whatever it's worth, right?
76. This tastes horrible and doesn't dissolve in cold liquids.  I tried apple juice and it just left clumps, tried both adding to cup before and after liquid.  I decided to try using it in coffee, and it tasted horrible.  I added some hot chocolate and it still tastes horrible, but slightly less so.  I certainly wish I didn't get the 8oz container to start.  Oh well.  So far no major herx reactions.  Teasel root usually is within a few hours, this has been a three doses so far.
77. Perfect for Eli-pens and the orange color stands out when in the bottom of a backpack or a purse or whoever you leave them!!
78. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for for my vape "waxshatter" now I just need to figure out who to buy the dual coil dabber!
79. I purchased this for my sister and she loves it.  The animal covers make this such a cute and practical gift.
80. These are great roller bottles for using with my essential oil recipes. Love them!
81. Great little curing iron!
82. I have been taking the Etana Immune Blend supplement and I like it. It contains the key ingredients to help protect my immune system. These capsules are standard size and easy to swallow. Also, there is no bad taste or aftertaste. We’ll see how it holds up as America reopens from the pandemic!
83. Scraped my shin down to the bone.  I use these daily to protect my shin.  So easy to use
84. I opened the box and looked at this curler and then read the instructions.  Am I suppose to shove the end of my hair into the open end?  Does it pull my hair in and around the round device inside the hole?There are no instructions about how exactly to use this and there is only one picture showing end of hair in the open hole.  So I decided to try this out.  The music is cute but not really needed.Tried different ways of trying to get my hair in it and finally it pulled it in and stopped.  My hair was jammed around the inside.Now I'm sitting here and hoping it wasn't going to burn it before I can figure a way to get my hair out without cutting it.I just kept pulling while pushing the button.  After 10 mins I finally got my hair out of it.  Packed it up and won't try it again.I'll stick with a regular curling iron.
85. I've suffered from migraines for about 11 years. (Technically, I just get the migraine auras plus strong light sensitivity that irritates my eyes.) These glasses do help, although they aren't going to completely fix your problem. According to medical studies, green light is the easiest light on the eyes and brain for people who suffer from migraines. The green tint is soothing, reduces how much bright lights normally irritates my eyes, and helps to prevent getting a migraine. To be clear, I get some migraines when wearing these from time to time, but they still help in reducing light sensitivity and reducing chance of getting a migraine. I also like that it has the green part of the glasses on the side to protect light coming in from your peripheral vision. I wear them daily at work when staring the computer all day.
86. Who doesn’t like bath bombs? Well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me. These bath bombs are great. They are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath. The fragrances these have are fantastic. I tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to “plain” vanilla.You get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over $20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it. These come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me. I will probably have to get these again when I am out. The only one I am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint, but that is because I just don’t like that fragrance but it will come in handy when I have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses.
87. I had not heard of D-Mannose and Cranberry Supplement until a few months ago when I was desperately seeking relief from UTIs every few months. I'd been taking apple cider vinegar, cream of tartar, and baking soda, which works well, but takes too long.After the first sign of another UTI, I took three of these for 5 days, and I stopped having any symptoms from day one. It never did turn into a full-blown UTI. I've been taking one a day ever since.I'm so thankful to have found this, as UTIs are so painful and irritating. It's nice to have something that will help keep them away. Though this is a bit expensive, it works very well. I might look for a coupon or shop around when I run out, but I would absolutely recommend taking D-Mannose and Cranberry Supplements.
88. This isn't moisturizing but just runny. DOn't waste your money and get the simple vaseline that we all know..
89. I agree with first reviewer. Too thick does not appy easily, tends to stick to plastic tube applicator tip, not metal like muro 128. Very bad product, not well formulated for humans. Would not use on the dog, either.
90. This is a huge spatula.  I like that it is almost straight (indeed I was hoping it would be completely straight up and down) unlike a turner.  (Note the picture where I compare this wood spatula to my pink silicone and SS turner that is much more angular.)  I wanted to have something with a firm base but a straighter design because a friend showed me that her straight up and down wooden spatula puts a lot less stress on the wrists when breaking up big batches of ground beef and shifting them around.  I tried to purchase a silicone head straight up and down spatula from Le Creuset, but for my intended use it was a waste of money--not firm enough and with too narrow of a head.  I am really looking forward to using this instead.  I do wish that instructions for the proper care of the wood (apart from not putting in the dishwasher) were included, as I am unused to wooden implements.  Also, there are a couple of slight indentations in the wood on the very bottom edge of the spatula; this may be customary in natural wood products, but I simply don't know If it is.  But other than that, I am pleased.Potential customers may be interested to note that this is large, definitely larger than most turnersspatulas I have previously encountered, that the bottom is almost but not quite flatstraight across, and that the corners of the bottom curve in ever so slightly in addition to the slight angle of the mostly-straight-on head.  It can be hard to tell details from pictures.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for leaving an unbiased review, and I count myself lucky, as I had basically been looking for precisely this item.
91. I used to give out Homemade candy for my Auxiliary ladies they were a hit
92. Can't taste this at all. I put it in my coffee in the morning when I remember 😂 but I do like the fact that you can mix it with anything, stir and you're done. No after taste, isn't in the bottom of your cup. Would recommend..
93. Exstreamly cheaply made
94. This is all new to me, what a wonderful extract I have used it for a week or so and I feel more energy and overall well being. I purchased this for a discount for my honest opinion.
95. I like these loofah soaps. These, however, seemed like the loofah was placed too close to the edge. In the past, they were in the middle of the soap bar. But I like the soap, the scents and the price. Will try again.
96. Worked great at first then stopped working right after return window was closed !
97. Does a great job cleaning.
98. Great item. Good price. Fast ship
99. I got this to mix with water to put magnolia leaves in per things I read.  It worked and the magnolia leaves are not brittle and work and look good in an arrangement.
100. Strong electric motor. Quality construction. Works very well.
101. Does no work at all! very disappointed. Received it over the weekend and added some as directed but it was still slipping.  And to add, the wax got into one of my lens and now the lens is blurry and stained. So technically my glasses got messed up because of this product.
102. This was easy to swallow.  Unfortunately, did nothing for me.
103. I also purchased this with a Groupon and it's a piece of junk. It barely heats up at all and does very little to curl my lashes. Wish I hadn't thrown the packaging and stuff away bc I'd return it if I could. I like my Panasonic one much better, although you have to hold the switch down to get it to heat. I bought this one thinking it would heat while I was doing other things, which it does, it just doesn't curl very well.
104. As described. You can’t beat the price. I’ve used the big name brand ones and this brand does the job well.
105. Not a lot to say because it's so simple, but it works perfectly well and is great for people with fobs or separate keys they need to get apart quickly.
106. Elegant it is and heavy too, just a note to make sure the suction pad is tight before hanging the squeegee.  It hung best against the glass shower door, not so much on the wall.  Besides its sleek look it functions pretty awesomely with its long length to cover a wide area and the rubber worked well to pull the moisture off the surface.  A good squeegee
107. They are adorable
108. I tried to remove baked on gunk on my cookie sheets but not very successful. These fell apart after use with a little elbow grease. Won't buy again
109. Didn't feel much change in the fridge
110. I highly recommend this walk Air purifier works extremely well specially if you have a small room
111. These are so stiff that it takes a lot of pressure to plunge the syringe. Instead I end up losing some of the meds before my dogs and cats get their full doses. Not great when youre trying to administer meds while holding a squirmy angry pet. Plus they are literally single use. They get stuck after 1 use and cannot be used again.
112. great supplement. quality and quick and packaged well.
113. A little too high and deep for a neck pillow for me. But works great behind the knees or in front of my other orthopedic pillows to elevate my legs or to ease my spine. Nicely made. No smell. Soft at the very top, but firm at the core. Very comfortable for knees and legs. Wide enough for larger than average legs. Although very large or very heavy legs may wear it out sooner.  I'm a tall gal, big gal, with longer than average legs. It's holding up quite well for me after several months. Nice zippered pillow case.  I'm happy with it.  I hope they continue to manufacture these, because when this one wears out I will re-buy. If you sweat a lot you might want to cover it with a towel to make it last longer? This material breaks down in damp and humid air, hence it will get flatter sooner. So keep it dry.
114. This polisher did exactly what I wanted it to do
115. I have been purchasing and using EO Lavender Hand Cleansing Wipes for years.  EO products are the very best quality in overall product generation.  The lavender fragrance with essential oils is beyond amazing!  Can't say enough about how much I truly love and enjoy!
116. The photo showed a container with 32 onces of hydrogen peroxide but the description is for half of that.  The price is exorbitant if you only get half of what is shown in the photo.
117. Sprayer doesn’t work. Very little comes out and difficultgets stuck when you press down to spray.
118. I admit, I bought these because I couldn't find my normal disposable wipes anywhere. I didn't think I'd be impressed, but in 2020 - you make do. Well, I am so pleasantly surprised with these. Not only are they super soft, but they do the job well. Thanks!
119. I tried this out right away on some wood handle knives we have.  Absorbed in quick and really conditioned the very dry wood (they go through to dishwasher which is horrible to do to any knife let a lone a wood handled).  Seems to leave a finish on the wood that should work to protect it from water.  Super easy to use and no bad odor.  Love the food safe aspect and I'm going to use this on the wooden cider press I have.  Great product.
120. I bought this to keep with me on my recent trip to several Asian countries. Those countries are notorious for not providing soap in restrooms. This travel soap worked perfectly for my needs. I am incessantly needing to keep my hands clean and this helped my mild obsession. I also wear contact lenses and require clean hands for handling the contacts. I never got an eye infection, despite the questionable water supply. I'll attribute that safety to the good soap I was using. Buy it!
121. Very comfortable hopefully wont have to use one again but it was a. Great choice bevause you can pump it up to ur contour it inflates around ankle amd shin area !!!!
122. I wish they were different grades of courseness, but these are all the same and a little too course. But ok.
123. I really like this jewelry organizer. It has lots of compartments for all my bracelets to fit securely. It has some zippered pockets too. I can't wait to travel with it!
124. This ice pack works on small area like my hand..but comes out of the freezer very hard. I need to wait a while for it to soften and be more comfortable. But I do like that it is not bulky or difficult for me to hold.
125. If you MUST save on space, consider these laundry soap sheets.  I will be honest, though... hotel bar soap and baby wash made my clothes smell (and therefor feel) cleaner to me when doing laundry in the sink.  The soap sheets were easier to rinse out than the alternatives, but I do appreciate a good sudsing.  One time during our trip I ended up with a shirt so stinky (after one day on a train... and I am not a stinky woman usually!) that these sheets made the shirt a lost cause.  I'll blame it on the Turkish food, but man, these things could not keep up.  I ended up trying a combination of hand sanitizer, bar soap, this stuff, and Downy spray, but the initial wash seemed to &#34;set&#34; the stink.
126. Neat concept, but the design still needs work. When working properly it is convenient to have the capability to store snacks in one side or water and a preintraworkout. It is, however, not without flaw.Leaking: I have one of the older versions of this shaker and noted leaking as a main issue. This was supposed to have been one of the areas of improvement on newer models, but it's still not perfect yet.Durability: 1 drop from no more than 2 feet rendered the shaker useless
127. This is the best bum cleaner ever!I’m a big girl and gained a bit more weight during the pandemic and started having issues reaching to clean my bum in the shower. It wasn’t pretty, let me yell you.I did some searching and comparing and settled on the butt scrubber.I handle is long, the yellow head is made of some type of silicone and very sturdy.I got in the shower and soaped it up and got to work and trust me, this device gets in there and cleans everything. My cheeks are tight so wrapping a towel around the head is out of the question. My bum is much cleaner these daysWhen I’m finished I soap it up, rinse and place it upside down in a container solution of white vinegar and water and let it soak for a while.Trust me, your bum will thank you for it.
128. I can't smell this but for just a micro second after spraying it.  It initially has a little bit of a bleach smell but then nothing.  I sprayed some in my daughter's really stinky running shoes and it helped a lot.  I could use this in a gallon size since we have pets and stinky tennis shoes.  It seems to work as advertised so unless it stops working I think it deserves 5 stars.
129. Fine quality! Tasty broth. If you have been consuming bone broth, the price and the quality do correlate. This is top-shelf.Much better than  expected
130. Still taking and evaluating
131. This product is far superior for sweaters and bras.
132. Great compression stockings. My mom loves them and the quality is really good. They don't run easily.
133. I'm a true believer in the red light therapy camp. I've had excellent results myself and have seen the same on others. That being said, I have a bad neck and was hoping this would be flexible enough to use there and hopefully improve it. It does the job but is really hard to get it into place. It's easier on my shoulder or leg but I wish it was curved in shape for where I need it. I'll definitely use this but am still in search of.....
134. got it yesterday, I am so delighted with this product. I have kind of fine hair. After my hair was washed and dried. Within minutes as a first time user, My hair looked professionally done. Totally excellent, certainly worth the money. I am usually not handy with my kinky curly hair. And I dread washing as I will have to fix it again. (to look presentable) I would give this a 10 star if I could
135. This is the most YUMM and PERFECT chocolatebeet powder.  I use it in baking.  It's the only way that I can get my grankids to eat beets. I use it in red velvet deserts too with red gel coloring for extra brightness.  This has a great taste on its own even tho it has a bitter quality but that is part of the life of brilliant untreated chocolate.  It blends into hot cocoa, cream cheese, batters, whipped cream and when I whip cream into butter for a different spin on things and at that point, I will add coconut sugar that has been finely ground into the whip as well to work on bringing sweetness. There really is no limit to creation with this product... I'm going to need to get more.
136. I like vegetables but sometimes need to fix things quick with less mess and these steamer bags are great.  The food tastes real and not like cooked in a microwave.  No mess.  Just toss the bag when done.  Great.
137. I did not order this for myself but the individual who is using the smelling salts has been very happy with the results. I've been told this is how smelling salts should be. So, on her behalf, I highly recommend to those looking for a good smelling salt.
138. I was skeptical about buying this but I'm so glad I did. It absolutely works. No more itchy mosquito bites. Instantly gets rid of symptoms right after use.
139. It’s ok but you can use your fingers and it does the same.
140. This is really helpful for trigeminal neuralgia as well as aids with seasonal hay fever.  I try to keep some on hand all the time and use it as needed.
141. This is a great supplement for neuropathy. I was experiencing neuropathy symptoms, and after taking this product I've been feeling better. The symptoms are subsiding. I am taking two tablets daily and it works perfect for me. I feel more energetic, I don't get so often the burning and tingling sensation. Also, it is helping me with the pain. I am looking forward for long term results, at the moment it is working for me. I am feeling better.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.
142. As an older person, I wanted to correct my posture so ordered this (after trying another brand without being satisfied with it).  It was easy to put on and adjust.  After a while, I forgot I had it on as it was quite comfortable.  I have not had any pain but, day by day, I can feel it holding my spine better erect.  I will continue to wear it for a while each day until I have reached my goal.  I even like the pretty pink color.
143. If your an active person this cover tape is what you may be looking for, tape provides for a secure attachment of your sensor.
144. I received this item very quickly. That said, it comes with absolutely no directions...not even the picture that you see on the web page, it arrives in a clear plastic type bag...but nothing else. It takes some real getting used to once you put it on. It's better than a CPAP, but if you are sensitive to having something on your face, this will cause you issues. As for snoring, I've been told that it has lessened my snoring somewhat, but it has not eliminated it.
145. This olive oil looks good, smells good and tastes like high quality extra virgin olive oil. Took off a star because I don’t know if this is a reputable company for something I will be consuming. Also, Costco is known to have some of the highest quality Organic EVOO, so I usually just buy that.
146. These have and excellent mix of fragrances with strong scents that are great for aromatherapy. One or two did smell a little like alcohol, which makes me wonder about additives, as well as the fact that both Rose and Jasmine have their fragrances removed through water soluble methods more often than oil or fat soluble ones, so I also wonder if those are real. But I don’t really care too much, so whatever. Smells good. It’s not like I’m eating it or anything.
147. I love the product
148. Very nice product.  We got it to use for an art project and I really don't know the other uses for it. Lotions maybe?  It seems to be very high quality.  We only used a small amount, so there is plenty left for next year, and the price was excellent compared to small bottles sold locally.
149. This fish oil has a pleasant, light orange taste.  I will repurchase it!
150. These steamer bags are a great way to get your veggies in.  I had bought the Ziploc brand before for a lot more money but these are just as good quality and much less expensive
151. Though the gray color put me off at first, the results were great--soft, shiny hair. The smell is strong, but it  reminds me of a spa that uses a lot of natural products and I like it.
152. Great relief for my knee when I have the occasional stiffness. From time to time, I have a knee tightness that prevents me from walking straight. It normally goes away after 2 days but it is a pain to walk and drag one leg. The compression is just enough to make me walk and not strain too much.
153. Love how much curl it gives my lashes and they stay curled until I wash my face.  The rotating wand is weird, or maybe I am.  Can’t figure out how or why to use it.  Also turning the rotating wand on and off takes a few tries.  Overall, love the product!
154. Absolutely love this! I've bought so many curling irons and ended up throwing themOut because they don't get hot enough to curl my hair. This definitely does the job! I got the perfect curls with this and I just received the item yesterday curled my hair for a Photoshoot with my son. I have a lot of hair and thick hair and I didn't have a hard time what so ever. Highly recommend. Also got here right on time
155. I think these latex-free gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while.
156. During the cold months of winter it is nice to use a furniture polish which shines up all your wood desks, bookcases and tables. I love Endust because it makes wood glow with natural beauty and keeps dust at bay for at least a while until you can dust again. I like that this leaves no greasy or oily residue. It wipes off clean. The scent is pleasant too and that makes cleaning more fun. I find it works best to spray the cleaner onto a clean rag, that way there is not over spraying.~The Rebecca Review
157. Bought this for my sister to improve her grip strength. she loves it and it's adorable too
158. Very soft. Works great
159. Its  smells like my hair is always burning and the plates  don't seem to keep my hair straight  for more then a few hours
160. This smells SO good and really does help detangle and defrizz my toddler's hair.  We like it!
161. It's difficult  to hold especially  when the suds hit ur hands this needs to be a lil smaller but its not hard on the sclap
162. Reviews for first aid products like this are more passfail than 1-5 stars. The product packaging will hold up and keep the tube sterile. The tube itself appears to be well made. So yes, I can recommend purchase for your first aid kit. Pass.
163. How can I describe my exhaustive search for an applicator bottle for my hair oils that has a long tip so that you can part hair with it?? Hair color applicator bottles are expen$ive!! and I just didn't want to pay that price anymore. I want a nicely organized beauty closet so I was searching for applicator bottles to store my hair oils to ensure they don't spill over, and have the long tip to make partings in my hair!  Sooo glad I found this bottle. I will be ordering more to put each type of natural oil in them and will look nice in my closet. Really happy with this purchase. The bottle is soft and squeezable, and you have to cut the tip off to make an opening. It's also the right size, not too tiny (like what's in a craft store) and not too big like many hair coloring bottles. Just perfect!! I can see the value of storing your crafting liquids in this, and consider it for your beauty needs too! :) really happy
164. I have been taking apple cider vinegar with mother gummies for years. This brand has more than just apple cider vinegar. It also comes with B vitamins and other ingredients.
165. I prefer the Nasopure System Kit for sinus irrigation because I can control the flow and the nozzle tip forms a better seal with my nostril than traditional ceramic Neti Pots. The buffered salt solution is less likely to cause any irritation and it's pre-measured. Easy peasy, just mix and apply a light squeazy.The Neti pot has been around for hundreds of years, and when used properly it is the safest and most effective remedy to clear my stuffy sinuses and help relieve postnasal drip. I cannot use the over the counter sinus meds because some make me drowsy and others give me palpitations.PLEASE READ:1. The most important RULE to remember, and this is not optional, is to NEVER USE TAP WATER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IF you MUST use tap water let it boil for just over a minute or san and allow it to cool to room temperature before using.  Distilled sterile water is recommended and you can buy it in the grocery store.2. If you are unfamiliar with the proper technique for using a Neti Pot there are many instructional videos on YouTube. This should be a safe and relatively comfortable experience.3. Clean the NetiPot after every use. and let air dry.Please follow ollow the instructions and read recommendations on the FDA's website to ensure safe use and you're good to go.** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **
166. While this product might not be for everyone, for my situation, it's fabulous.I have to watch every drop of water I use. Each of these generously sized mitts is in its own individual pouch. As opposed to the more common dry mitts or cleansing towels that you add water to, these are presaturated with a soapy smelling solution that cleans every inch of your body.A quick rinse, and you're done. With almost no water usage.This would be great for campers as well.
167. I'm very happy with this set! All four items came individually wrapped and they are all pretty nice quality, especially given the price for all of them. There were a couple loose stitches here and there but nothing major.The glove has a cute pattern and a hole on each side of the bottom so it stays on your hand. The loofah side feels nice and the exfoliating side actually works. It makes my skin feel noticeably smoother after just one use but it's not so rough it causes discomfort on my very sensitive skin. The back loofah is especially nice and the material is very soft. The regular loofah works very well and I actually had to start using less body wash on it because it works up ample lather with just a small amount. They all have handles to hang them up to dry. Overall I'm happy with this purchase.
168. I bought these to dress up my fence. They look really great! I've put different flowers and plants in them and they look really awesome on my fence.
169. We had a couples baby shower and this game was part of the fun! Both the boys and the girls wanted to try to get their sperm directly on the egg.
170. Love this heated eyelash curler, has 3 heat settings. It does get hot. It’s chargeable which is great and comes with extra styling tools. With it hade a case or pouch to carry it all.
171. This Gel Knee Support comes in handy when I have a weak knee.  Periodically, my knee tends to give out.  With this, I feel much more support to the area.  This is a nice, quality support with Gel padding on the front where the front of the knee is.The material is strong,  and most important breathable.  Oftentimes, if you don't have breathing material, it can become tight and sweaty.  There is no opening, just slip if through the food.  I can do this while exercising, because staying in place is important.Check the sizes for sure before you order.  Mine is the X-large, and I am not large, but the tightness is fine.  Maybe I should have received a smaller one, but  right now this one works.Nice support.  Good quality fit.....  Review for Gel Knee Support
172. I use this as my daily probiotic about a quarter cup a day and it has a wonderful taste.  I would recommend to anyone.
173. So we called this my husband's leg condom.  Due to an infection he had his prosthetic knee replacement removed and then six weeks later a new prosthetic knee implanted.  This allowed him to shower with his leg restraint on, without worry of contaminating the incision, or getting his dressings wet.  It looks really weird at first with the whole disc thing, but it does work and is long enough for even a tall guy to use.  It is tight, so don't expect to wear it for a long twenty minute shower.  Highly recommend.
174. People take curcumin for the anti-inflammation benefit. I don’t personally notice anything from taking a lot of curcumin from many companies. Considering the relatively high price for curcumin, I would like there to be a more noticeable benefit.I measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them, which is close to what I expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients. It means these capsules have minimal to no fillers, which is what they advertise.You are after the curcumin, not the turmeric, so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing. The current price is $13 for 90 pills, which $1.44gram. The 90-pill bottle is $0.94gram. The NOW brand 60 pill bottle costs $0.33gram. The Doctor’s best 120 pill bottle is $0.34gram. Nothing about this B’LEAF NATURE curcumin would suggest that it is a better product that is worth such a price premium over the established reputable brands.You can buy tumeric root at the grocery store if that is what you want. Tumeric is too bulky relative to the active compounds for it to be a good supplement. Instead, focus on supplements that contain just the curcumin extract, and ones that contain more of the desired extract than what is in this pill.Made in the USA in GMP certified facility.
175. It’s honestly so cute, I love it! I used 7 slots for daily supplements and I use the 8th slot for Tylenol!
176. these are not the quality of others i have bought directly from local pharmacy stores.  they will not clean in the ear-only around the entrance to the ear canal
177. Perfect as an addition to a raffle basket with a Sleep theme
178. This brush has pretty firm bristles, almost too firm - I am afraid sometimes that I might break the skin of more tender items, like tomatoes. Although the ring is nice for grabbing, it would be easier to use if the bristle area was straight.
179. Spirulina powder is kind of one of those trendy health supplements right now, so I'm not surprised by the price, especially for an organic product.Easy to add into green smoothies and such, if you don't put a crazy amount, the flavor is pretty easily hidden, not bad!
180. I used to drink those ICE smoothies at Target, as a kid. Taste brings back memories! Quality is decent for getting a pump.
181. Baggy, didn't fit properly, middle finger was tiny, which is your longest finger.  Sent back
182. It didn’t really help keep my glasses up and wore off after a short while.  It may work for people with different shaped noses, I think glasses have a harder time staying on mine.
183. Very impressed with this item well worth the price
184. Best product on the market for cleaning!  I am so glad I discovered these.  I use them to clean my tile floor, bathtub, refrigerator, counter tops etc.  They clean so well you don't really need to use much cleaning solution. If you haven't tried these, you should.
185. I used it as a roller!!
186. I bought a package of two because I was trying to approximate the Facia Blaster (not available on amazon at this time) and hoped this would work just as well.  Probably would have been workable except for two things... the octopus top has a face and the nose part of the face is pokey when you're grabbing the top and trying to &#34;blast&#34; your facia with it.  Also I had only been working for about 5 minutes when the top of the first one unscrewed and when I tried to screw it back on again (these are two piece massagers that you screw the top handle part onto the bottom fingers part) it was stripped and would just spin in a circle and come off again.  Could'nt be secured in place.  If this were a solid single piece construction and a smooth knob for the top it would have been a GREAT option for facia blasting.  I think I'll just end up buying the actual facia blaster.UPDATE:  I had been giving up trying to approximate the facia blaster and was about to buy the product but I had been hearing from youtube reviews that it was taking a long time to arrive and I didn't want to stop efforts to blast while waiting waiting waiting.  I found a DIY facia blaster online and decided to make one and these little guys are just the ticket.  Hooray.  Here's a link to the DIY project tutorial:http:www.wellnessgeeky.comhomemade-fascia-blaster-alternative-diy
187. I use these every Christmas. I used to have a whole bunch of holders and I can’t find them. Was happy to find a kit with 2 holders and 5 scenters. A little pricey for my taste but the scent has held up pretty well. Normally they last about 3-4 days and then your nose gets used to it.
188. I liked the aroma while opening the box of shower steamers but in the shower they gave a light scent. I could smell it in the shower but wish it was a little stronger of a scent. I did like the scent so it was pleasant.UPDATE: I wanted to update my review a s state that depending on the scent, you may have more pleasant aromas!  I used another scent out of the pack and it smelled great and had my bathroom smelling like it. I think some scents are lighter than others.
189. worked out as exspected
190. I have reordered many times, fast shipping and comfortable.
191. i can't imagine putting this in my eyes, even if it was diluted. Felt like pure cayenne pepper in my mouth
192. Wow! I can tell my hair and nails are growing out thicker and stronger and I've only been using this for about 2 weeks. It might take you a while to take these if you have trouble taking pills because the serving size is 6 pills. I can take 10 pills at once so it's no issue for me. I understand that this supplement is made from whole foods, so it makes sense the serving size is more that one pill. You want to make sure it works and it does!
193. I got these to replace the pad on my Libman spray mop and these work great. They fit well on the head and are secure on the unit. The best thing is when these get dirty I have a replacement while the other is being washed.
194. Good quality flights and good thickness.  Wife wanted them and she really likes the way they look.
195. They work, for the price, can't beat them!
196. Creatine Monohydrate is the most affordable form of creatine. This is also micronized creatine so it dissolves better. This dissolves almost instantly in water - I stir it a bit with a spoon. The taste of this creatine is almost completely neutral so it blends into any drink. The recommendation is to stir this into water, non acidic juice or a carbohydrate drink. The benefits of drinking creatine is that it helps you increase your energy so you can have more strength and endurance when lifting weights.~The Rebecca Review
197. Got them for both of my girls and they love it.
198. I think the use of noise cancelling is a little lost in translation but otherwise these were great and came in really handy.  When I travel and am in a secured place it's nice to be able to block out all the noise and get some good rest.  These did an excellent job.  I also used them when going to the shooting range and they worked great there also.  Having the different sizes meant I had an extra pair to give to someone that didn't have proper ear protection at the range. The hard carrying case is great to have as well or I would've lost them a long time ago.To be noise cancelling they would have to produce a counter noise, so the use of that term is incorrect but they do block out a good amount of sound.  I was very happy with them and had no problems with them at all.
199. I am highly disappointed! I have never taken hair growth vitamins but since doing the BC not once but twice in the last 4 years of going natural i did extensive research looking for hair growth vitamins that contained everyrhing i would need for healthy hair. I heard great things about hairfinity but decided DasGro had everything my hair needs to grow.Now let me say this: i love the product and wanted to wait till i was done with my second bottle before leaving a review...reason for the 2 stars?I never received my second bottle, yet everyday i'm receiving text messages from the carrier, ( will be delivered today) i had yet received it and when it comes to any type of supplement i like to stay consistent. Sadly i had to spend more money and purchase Hairfinity (went to the beauty supply store ) hopefully it works just as good as DasGro..
200. Pumpkin seed oil is a culinary specilty that is also often found in food supplements. It's a more readily available form of pumpkin seeds which are presumed to treat bladder irritation, kidney infections, intestinal worms, and trouble urinating due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). My dad is in his 60s has started to develop prostate difficulties.I advised for him to take pumpkin seed oil capsules and he says that urination is much easier and clinically there are no concerns from his doctor.
201. I think the frequency works for all pests. I don't hear sny more scratching near the attic above my bed, but I rarely used the night light and it turns on and then immediately off. I have bought 3 and it all does that so glad that the unit itself still works, perhaps an LED bulb for longetivity.
202. Works just fine for me. Clear instructions, plenty of refills, comes with several preset so you don't have to immediately place the filters in the frames.
203. yum!!  smells really good!  very subtle
204. I use these in my Halo mask! They are comfy, I can breathe!
205. This big set of shoe inserts has everything you need to make any shoe comfortable.  It is very handy.
206. Perfect for whay I've used it for . I thought I had kidney stones . Worked well
207. I often find myself using my less accurate no-touch forehead thermometer to avoid dealing with the sterilization process following the use of an oral thermometer These digital thermometer sleeves work great and about the only issue I have encountered was removing it from its protective packaging without dealing with extra pieces of plastic.
208. There's not much to describe. It is a simple product and I received exactly what I wanted.
209. I mean, yeah, it makes it convenient. It is a complete mineral profile. I like that about it. But sadly, it uses inferior forms of some minerals. They used calcium carbonate, which is one of the most poorly absorbed calciums (citrate is what you want), as well as magnesium oxide, which is also poorly absorbed - you want malate or gycinate. That made me a bit disappointed in this product. It's not too hard to swallow and goes down easy, but in the end...it's not the best.
210. Extra fluffy when new and dry, but not so much once wet. Not as good as the original mop heads but still good for the money.
211. It does what is says it will do -removes hair painlessly.  It does take significant amount of time rubbing it in a circular motion to remove the hair, but it does eventually remove the hair and it does not hurt at all, unlike waxing or using an epilator.  Your skin is exfoliated in the process so it is really smooth afterwards.  I was able to do one half of my leg from the knee down, on the front, before my arm got too tired so I will do a little each day after my shower until it is all done.BONUS: it also works on facial hair that I normally get a wax treatment for.  I was looking at my lady lip hairs and it reminded me that I need to make an appointment for a wax treatment, then saw this device sitting on the bathroom counter and had a lightbulb moment…would this work on my little bit of random lip hair???  I had just washed my face so I gave it a try and it worked!  Again, the exfoliation left my skin feeling smooth and soft, and no little hairs needing to either be plucked or waxed.  Because of this along I have upgraded it from 4 stars to 5 stars, now I don’t need to schedule a wax appointment and have my upper lip swollen and red all day after the waxing like it usually is.  I had no irritation at all from this device.  Saying goodbye to my every couple of weeks painful waxing appointments!I had my doubts that it would work, or if it did remove the hair it would have my sensitive skin very irritated, but I was wrong on both parts.  It worked and my skin was not harmed at all.  Kind of a cool device. And cost less than a single waxing appointment too!
212. I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS FISH OIL TASTES.  I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY GET IT TO TASTE THIS GREAT, I'M JUST GLAD THEY DO.
213. Shipping took a bit longer than expected. Good price and value.
214. Have a hole in your tooth from a crown falling out? It works.
215. This my second brush I purchased but this brush takes too long to heat up and I had the temp on 450
216. This is a huge urinal for women. Nothing discreet about this thing. I am not going to take it with me at all - I would rather go in the great outdoors instead.
217. Not much to say other than these were the size and color I needed
218. Needs smoothed hole edges but I can do that easily myself in a few minutes.
219. These glasses seem to be a wire-eh style.  They can get easily crushed in man pockets.  So i'm not sure.  The frame is too lightweight and lacks the comfort at the ear piece and nose piece.  I wanted wider fitting for my BIG head.  So, these were good for that purpose.  Yet, when they are on, and I am looking thru the glasses, I can see the glass frame edges all the time.  I since bought another STYLE glasses.  And now, use these as spares, around the house.* yes, they fit around my BIG head nicely.* no, the lenses are smaller than comfort* nose piece is flimsy* entire glass frame is flimsy
220. This RAVELER SLEEP MASK (for Woman and Man, Contoured, with Ear Plugs) is good at blocking out light, but lets some light in at the nose area.  This is because the nose area is pre-shaped (like the nose area in a Halloween eye mask), so that the sleep mask doesn’t lie completely flat against the nose.Sleep masks designed with padded fabric across the lower edge of the mask (below the eyes and across the nose) do a more complete job of blocking out light (see, e.g., ).  However, this sleep mask, which comes with a set of rubber ear plugs, gives good value for the price (less than $6 on Amazon).  It also has a very wide and comfortable elastic band for holding the mask in place while you sleep.
221. The band I received from WITHit was the molded style (not decal) and is amazing!  I get tons of compliments on it.  It fits my pebble time perfectly.  The colors are exactly as pictured.  It matches pretty much everything.  Highly recommend.
222. Pros: great size, good temp control (7 levels), very softCon: only one; you can feel the heat wires when you hold it. If you’re laying on it, you can’t tell.
223. I am completely new to gua sha techniques, so I thought this roller set would be a good entry point and for the most part, it is! If you are looking for a set that will allow you to learn the techniques at a good and reasonable price point, then try these and upgrade to stainless or real jade at some point in the future.My big gripe about these is that they do feel a little cheap. I am not entirely sure that it is real jade, and when the roller arrived the larger roller was popped out of place and I had to pop it back in there, but it feels really really insecure in there now. If the packaging was better, this might not have happened. That's okay though, because I really just wanted the handsculpting too so I can live with the roller not being great. If you are buying this for the roller, I would look elsewhere. Otherwise, I would recommend this set as a beginnerentry level piece.
224. Great for bug-bites and muscle painsspasms.Every home medicine cabinet should have in stock!
225. Perfect for summer outdoor parties and weddings!
226. Delivers the needed calories with a great Chocolate taste!
227. I was looking forward to getting this product for review-- I received a discount-- because I've had tinnitus for nearly 25 years. Because I've lived with it for so long, I'm not surprised that this supplement wasn't effective in my case. In fact, I would've been shocked if it had been!I will continue talking these and I will update my review if I notice a difference.
228. This item is not as good as advertised. I read the research paper the product is based on and the statistics looked decent but I am not one of the people this product worked a miracle on. I am back to the old acid blockers. This product is worth a try but after one bottle if you feel no improvement do not waste your money on another one.
229. I love this set & definitely will be purchasing more in the future! This set has everything you need to smooth & shape the nails. I highly recommend!
230. Collagen is a part of my daily routine, usually in coffee, since coffee is part of my daily routine.Each packet has 35 calories and 9 g of protein, all from cow collagen peptides.Unflavored, so nothing to interfere or overly sweeten.Pricier than similar collagens, and the serving size is larger than some others as well.Still, these are convenient packets for on the go. The packets are thoughtfully designed, very easy to open. No scissors needed.
231. This saved me money compared to the disposable pads that the pups like to tear apart.
232. Taste went away almost immediately. Everyone I shared it with said the same exact thing. I'm not sure if Stevia Gum can be done, but this product certainly hasn't cracked the code yet.
233. I've used a few tens units in the past and can state that this might be the most powerful one I've used though this power comes at the cost a shorter battery life. It worked for about 30 minutes out of the box though and when fully charged I got a few hours.This tens unit charges fairly quickly and provides muscle tensionpain relief so I definitely recommend this device.Just a reminder though that there are warnings online to not place the pads near your heart so I'd advise not using it on your torso or spinal cord.
234. I'm using these along with a scooter while I recover from a broken ankle.  I have arthritis in my shoulders so I this style of crutch works better for me balancing the pressure better for me.  These are reasonably priced but still good quality.
235. I will keep them, because I could can cut a piece of soft fabric (moleskin ?) to line with first, but in my opinion this “cushion” is worse on the sores than the furniture it is “protecting” against.  It is NOT a soft gel cushion.  It’s more like the scratchy styrofoam peanuts used in packaging - but thicker. Maybe I can find a gel pad to line it with. I have it two stars because I like the netted sleeve.  For AZ heat that is ideal. So, it has some value to me and  Not worth returning. But NOT soft enough to use for Bed Sores- that’s for sure!!!
236. It's a bit of a mess of cords and such, but it makes the flight box wonderful to use compared to batteries. I don't even use the batteries any more unless I'm mobile. Very nice. Using it lightly for 3 months, no problems or breaks so far.
237. This is a great battery. It works exactly as you would expect it to. So far it has provided us with a long life and it works great. I'm very happy with it!
238. I have always liked the cleaning job Mr. Clean Erasers did, but I hated the thin pads that wore away quickly and shredded. These pads are amazing. They don't shred into small pieces , and they scrub hard , dried messes. Love them for baseboard cleaning and quick wipe downs of nasty messes.
239. I like the oval shape, it’s good for working in between the scapula and spine.
240. I am really pleased that this product came up on my list of items I can review. When I saw it I instantly selected it because I know that Chlorella is an excellent green superfood. I love superfoods and consume them often. This one is just Chlorella with no Spirulina added, but if you want both in a capsule it's easy to find here on Amazon. If it's only Chlorella you're interested in this is a great way to take it. I like both the powdered and capsule forms. I like the powder for my smoothies but sometimes I don't want a smoothie and the capsules are a great alternative. I always feel better and more energized when I consume green superfoods. They have a lot of nutrition and naturally occurring minerals. There is nothing negative I can find to say about this product.
241. I really love these sponges. I hope they never stop making them.
242. Soft, comfortable, and stays warm when heated.  Highly recommended!
243. These are helpful and don't rub off. I forget they are on.
244. Fractionated Coconut Oil is good for making homemade soaps and beauty products but it's less potent for hair and body care use - I find the formula thinner but the trade off is that it isn't as greasy and you can still use it for moisturizing your hair and skin without that greasy coconut oil feeling (which stains too!). I have both kinds of oil - the real unprocessed kind for massaging into my hair, hands and nails, and this kind, which is versatile but lacks the smell of coconut but is good as a "carrier" oil. Both have their uses and this product is of decent quality - I would just go by price because I don't see any discernible difference between this one and other similarly priced brands of fractionated oil.
245. works well,stays closed
246. This product is very thin. If you are looking for something thin this is the way to go.
247. Great scissors, but a little small for a man's hands. Hey, who said nurse means woman's size?
248. Smells better than bonce
249. My only complaint with these molds is the size. Two millimeters is too small for an effective dose -- the 2 trays should come in a 5ml & 10ml size. Other than that, these are spot-on! I'd never made suppositories before & was afraid the caps on the bottom would be hard to remove from the directions they came with. But the caps pull off easily, no twisting needed. The pipettes make it easy to fill the molds without any overflow (use the pipettes once then toss them). And the individual molds & caps are easy to clean with a Q-tip dipped in alcohol. Definitely store your supps in the fridge once you make them & stick them in the freezer for 10 min. right before using them to prolong the melting time. This kit costs more than a 10-pk. of natural, plant-based supps that you'll find online, but it lets you make as many as you need, based on whatever formula suits your ailment. GOOD STUFF!
250. No more problems with hats being a little too tight. Fixed 3 ball caps so far. Love it!
251. Love this little thing.  I had a moldy smell in my bathroom.  Getting ready to renovate but until then bought this to help with smell and toxins.  After about 3 days the smell was completely gone.  Amazing.  Quiet little fan which is not annoying.
252. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!  Colonics have literally saved my life! I was diagnosed with a Pelvic Floor Dysfunction which led me to the inability to have a bowel movement on my own. And that, undoubtily,  led to all sorts of problems, health issues and diseases:- Auto-immune- Lupus- Chronic Fatigue- Epstein Barr- Hypo Thyroid Hatchimotos (sp?)- Fibermyelgia  ... prior to this, I was extremely healthy!  My career was in fitness. But after years of major constipation (at least 30 yrs), my &#34;then&#34; healthy body couldn't fight off the toxins anymore.  I became so toxic and sick.  There were days I could hardly get out of bed, but when I did - all I could think about was when I could lay back down and take a nap again.I'm a mom of a young family.  This unhealthiness was unacceptable, buy I was clueless regarding what I could do about it.  So I decided to doctor at the world famous Mayo Clinic, with the best docs in the world!!  After months and months of tests, the ONLY thing they could come up with was to remove my colon and live with a colostomy bag the rest of my life!!!  I was so depressed, but didn't believe I had any other choice.  Right before my surgery, my husband suggested I go see a Naturalpathic doctor to see if they could help me in any way. They chose to take me on as their most challenging, constipated patient client.  A BiG part of regaining my health was getting professional colonics. Do you know how expensive those things are? Between $60-$100!!!  I was getting one a week for 18 months (yes, that's how impacted I was). I knew this couldn't continue doing this as who can afford a life-style of this? I sure couldn't on my income. My extended family felt so badly for me, they would gift me with a colonic a month, just to help me out , when they could.  But I was still paying thousands out of my own pocket to continue this major cleanse I needed.  I thought I'd eventually have to just give in and use the &#34;bag&#34; as it was more &#34;affordable&#34;!  That's when I found out about this colonic board! Best info I've ever received!!  Changed my life!!  I ordered it immediately, it came in the mail that week, and I set it up (very simple) and went right to work.  During my first colonic, while using it - I had tears in my eyes.  It worked!!! What an answer to prayer.  No more having to pay for all those professional colonics.  On a side note, I just finished a radical 8-day detox cleanse, and using my colonic board daily was a big part of that .  I now feel better than I have in years! I'm not kidding.  I lost my bloated weight, I've got never ending energy,, my body nor my joints hurt anymore, I cant wait to get out of bed in the mornings, I'm happier ... no longer depressed, etc.  I am forever grateful to my new colonic board that has given me back not only my health, but my life!PS - Just to warn you, I've never met a 'Western' medical doctor who has approved of this practice, so don't expect them to be jumping up and down on your new-found discovery with you. But at the same time, I've never met a doctor - nor any person, who had as bad of a Chronic Constipation problem as I had.
253. We have a big variety of probiotics that we rotate and use daily.  This one has a very impressive label.  Now, I have no way to test any of these claims, so I just have to believe them.  This one gives more capsules for less money than many others, all-the-while giving lots of CFU's.Not long before the Covid19 outbreak, I had to take another round of antibiotics.  Since this wipes out all of the good bacteria in my intestines, I stocked up on several different pre + probiotics.  My thoughts are that different brands may have different types of good bacteria.After about two weeks of some serious probiotic dosages, which was also in the middle of the Covid19 outbreak, I got sick.  I had a fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  It really started to worry me.  It only lasted two days and was gone.  I have no proof but I am going to say that my pre and probiotics kept me from getting much sicker and also shortened the duration of my illness.
254. This does wonders for its size! My bf and I both have extremely bad allergies, especially during season changes. This helped us to get amazing sleep without stuffed noses ever since I got it! It takes about a day to sanitize the air (I have it in an 15x10 room), ALSO my guinea pigs were have allergy problems but after about a week of having this in my room (the guinea pigs cage is in myroom) their allergies cleared up and saved me from a huge pricey vet bill! I'll be buying another soon for my cat room!
255. The brand seems to have changed names twice since I've been using it and the new packaging is the same bottle they have always used but now it is also placed in a sealed heavy plastic bag...very, very wasteful and such a poor use of plastic for a company putting out 'organic' items especially. They already had a seal on the bottle and the cap is wrapped in a plastic band so the bag is truly wasteful. Also, I believe the mg in each bottle has changed at least twice...I believe 3 times...just seems sketchy since it was not advertised to have changed, I only knew by reading the package.  That said, it seems to work perfectly well, I just may start looking for another brand that gives me more confidence and less waste.
256. Saw this on insta and immediately bought thru Amazon Prime.(better $) BUT it is terrible > Poor quality>Poor instructions and flimsy cord for charging. It took forever to heat up and I was terrified that it would tangle my hair. I didn't have to worry because it would not wind fully.I returned and treated myself to a curling iron..sometimes old school is still the best!
257. Excellent product for hair that won't lie flat.  I've been using Tancho Tique for more than 50 years.
258. This pill box is pretty big, but it has to be to hold 31 days of medication.  The daily  pill containers are not huge, but the individual compartments will hold the six pills I take once a day, and few pills two more times a day.  The pill splitter is a nice addition also.  My wife is traveling for a month and she was worried I wouldn't take the right medicine while she was gone.  Now she can fill this pill box up for a month.  It's just he right pill box for my situation.  Glad I found it on Amazon, I was going to buy several small pill boxes.  The quality is good enough and should last a few years.
259. Got this for photo and video shoots where &#34;wardrobe malfunctions&#34; can't happen without requiring re-shooting.  The only thing that will hold outfits in place tighter (and not take skin off) is double-sided wig tape, but it is tough to conceal the tape outline if the fabric is thin.  This is in the middle of the spectrum between heavy duty &#34;Stickum&#34; sprays and the wig tape.Four stars instead of 5 because the applicator tip is less than ideal.  This product used to come packaged like a &#34;glue stick&#34; which seemed to be less messy than the applicator tip that come on this one.
260. Seems good quality
261. comfortable and absorbent
262. Strong motor easy to use
263. perfect! Very nice, exactly what i expected great price!
264. I have been taking 10,000 mcg biotin supplements daily for many years to help with hair and nail health. This Vita Mountain product has calcium in it as well, and I am not sure why they added that ingredient. As far as quality, I have no reason to score this less than five stars. For actual purchasing, I would go with whatever is cheapest, which is often Natrol or Nutricost. I am unaware of any notable differences between the brands.
265. This is useful and seems durable. It's replacing a similar cane I bought a year ago, which bent, but that was a different design for the leg and seemed less durable. I hope this one will last. I use a different cane in the summer but find it useful to have a light on the cane in the winter when I have to see ice and snow to walk. The flashing red light is very useful for crossing the street at night. The alarm might not seem like a great idea but let's be honest; there are people who attack cripples and I ended up needing the alarm only 2 days after I got the cane when I was randomly attacked near my home.I get a lot of compliments on it from people who are impressed with the idea of a cane with lights built in.
266. This is one of the best cheap beauty tool that is on the market right now! It is very affordable and within the budget. It is a no frills device, just place it in the refrigirator and it actually works! It is alao portable and can be brought during travel! What I love about this is that it also has a container which protects it from bacteria while in the ref! It is very helpful in giving relief against sinus pressure. Also, it instantly lifts and freshens up a tired face! The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that I find it cost more than similar products in the market now. Recommending it though!
267. Very sturdy, great price. Everyone at the wedding was jealous, as they were all sinking in the mud
268. Good quality sweet almond.
269. In my house we have a sock monster- who eats only one sock of every pair.  Then there is the mess monster.  He leaves a mess that no one knows anything about.  We also have another monster which has been frustrating me - the dustpan monster.  This monster not only makes dustpans disappear for months at a time, but when they come back, they have bites out of them or corners missing.  When I saw this, I was ecstatic.  Let's take a look.WHAT IS THIS SET LIKE?This set comes in a box of parts.  You have to put them together, but the instructions are easy to follow and loaded with pictures for those who are visual learners.  Once the set is assembled, you end up with a broom and a dustpan that clip together when not in use.HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?I have to say many brooms have left me wanting more.  This one, however, works just right.  It is not the BEST broom I have ever used, but it is definitely way better than many of them.  The cleaning feature of the dustpan is fantastic.  It really works.DOES THE DUSTPAN LEAVE DIRT ON THE FLOOR?If I press down the dustpan lightly, I find that 95% of the dirt goes in the first time.  I might have to press down with my foot for very fine dirt, but for the most part, it works well.DOES THE DUSTPAN LOCK?The dustpan locks into place, but it also is not hard to press down to use either.  There is no release button, it is pressure activated.IS THERE A HOLE TO HANG THIS FROM?No, there is not a hole to hang this from.  You will have to use a clip broom hanger style to put this on the wall.DOES THIS STAND UP?When this is put together and the dustpan is up, the counterbalance of the broom causes this to stand up pretty well.THE BOTTOM LINEI am very happy to have this set.  I love the dustpan which seems to work quite well and also has the great cleaning feature for the broom bristles.  It definitely does clean off pet fur and dust.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I LOVE THIS SET.  I have looked for a long time for a set like this- but the best part is that it stores well and stands up nicely too- It is compact.
270. Bought this as an alternative to fresh wild blueberries to add to the Medical Mediums heavy metal detox smoothie!
271. Oh my gosh I love my foam roller. I thought it might be too hard & dense at first but after a week of using it my body adjusted and my softer foam roller just isn't enough on most areas anymore. I'm a massage therapist and I get tight everywhere... I  use this to roll out my entire back, neck, upper arms, forearms, glutes, legs & feet (balancing on the roller & stretching that fascia on the bottom of the feet is great for plantar fasciitis). I like to use it after a hot shower or hot tub soak so I am loosened up a bit. It is so efficient that I'm able to spend less time on self carestretching than I used to. Hallelujah! With the accompaniment of a couple tennis balls to get into the small spots that's all I need. I use the smallest 12" size so I can transport it around with me to different offices, but I finally just got a 2nd one so I can always have one at my main office as well as home. When I realized how dependent I am on my foam roller I thought I really ought to write a review. I've also seen reviews of other brands saying they fell apart, and this one is super sturdy.  I've been using it at least once a day for roughly 6 months and it looks and feels exactly the same as the brand new one that I just received. I have a feeling it will probably last forever. Like, really forever, to the detriment of the environment. Uh, anyway great product
272. Love this pocket guide. Great information.
273. My doctor says SAM-e deteriorates rapidly from humidity.  He says must buy the kind in individual foil protection.  Too bad, cause these are cheaper but this form too fragile he says.
274. Good to have for large bandage backups.
275. Great price & perfect for upcoming hiking trip
276. I was apprehensive to order any compression stockings online but I did order these and I am so glad I did. The quality is great and they fit as expected. Wash well. I just let them air dry. If you are looking for a less expensive compression stocking you should buy these. Beats paying 100.00 plus at the doctor's office!
277. Great for the car or office.
278. I got these for my children so they could help with dishes and cleaning while protecting their hands. My 6yo loves them and actually volunteers to help clean, which is a miracle. These feel durable, and have held up to various tasks. Highly recommended!
279. I trust Garden of Life products. I love this one because their products are plant based.
280. I like form  of these, where i don't have to store big plastic bottle of detergent.  they are easy enough to use.for normal dirty clothese, these work fine.  The scent is not too strong, at least for my taste and my husbands.however, he worked in the yard putting up decorations and his clothes were a mix of sweat, dirt and i don't even know what.  I did use double dose and not all the dirt came out.  Most of it did, but there were still a few spots where i can see dirt spots.  My husband said it's ok becasue they are his work clothes but for me, i need my clothes clean, really clean.  the sweat smell came out nicely but i don't think this is strong enough for really tough, deep dirty clothes. We started using different things around the house to be eco friendly and this is a really nice way to add to that.  I did have to wash a few things again and i did use my normal detergent and it came out fine.
281. I love how many different sounds and intensities there are.I personally love the rain.  I just love the sound of rain.  It's soothing and really helps me relax to fall asleep.So easy to use.  I do like that it charges up using a USB cable.On the nights when it's just too chilly to turn on my fan, I like that I can still have the sound of a fan running without the cold air blowing.A great sound machine that can be used by anyone in the family.
282. These are so pretty and exactly what I wanted.
283. A bit more $$$ than the average pill holder but it IS worth it. Very sturdy clips on each compartment that should travel well. Easy to open, nice spring action too. A unique front facing design so you don't have to turn it around for night and day pills.
284. WOW You get 30 rolls of the best toilet paper I have found and a box of sturdy 30 gallon trash bags it doesn't get any better than that
285. Batteries leaked within package.  Put in new Dracells.  Motor doesn't work.
286. This is a tasty vitamin drink with trace minerals. I've been using it for 2 months and haven't noticed anything amazing but I do feel good about getting my nutrients. What I don't feel good about is, every time I look it up to buy another canister the price is higher! I won't be buying more until the price gets back to just over reasonable as the first 2 were. To me $43. and $44. are a bit high but my friend wanted me to try it. Now its $61.50, just 3 weeks later up 30%. No, I'm not going for it.
287. Ordered this for my Mom who lives all day in a nursing home. So far this seems to be working great for her when so many cushions before haven't.
288. I bought this for my son who is on the autism spectrum.  I was concerned that he wasn't getting is teeth completely clean everywhere.  Unfortunately,  this doesn't really work.  It barely moves and feels awkward.  I feel like it was a huge waste of money.
289. Easy to apply after bathing without spilling.  This is nice product without being too greasy.  Fine mist will do the trick without pouring it in your hand and possibility of spilling.
290. I can't notice any difference at all except for the strong odor it leaves. My shower has white tile that turns a little yellow if not cleaned. This product does no difference at all except on the yellow stuff. The only difference it will make to your life is the waste of money and the waste of time spraying after each time you take a shower.
291. As school starts and cold season approaches its time for immunity building! My spouse served me the drink and I asked if they added seltzer because it was so effervescent (which I like), but it was just from the tablet dissolving in water. My kids begged to taste it because it looks like lemonade, and they really liked the flavor! I was surprised. It didn't taste too bad to me either, slightly lemony. With three kids in school, here's hoping for less sickness this season!
292. Great scale arrive in perfect condition.
293. Not very sticky; they kept falling off. Sent them back.
294. Pay close attention, all of the reviews for this product are for hair conditioner or hair products.
295. When I first opened the container of gummies I was expecting to smell something light and citrus-y. Instead I was met with a very strong odor that smells like a combination of plastic and cleaning supplies. It's quite strong. Despite the rather scary aroma, I tried one anyway, and they are quite delicious, I'm just a bit put off by the smell.
296. I love to take a nice weekend nap, but our house gets a surprising amount of sunlight. Also when taking a day nap, my eyelashes end up all squashed and wonky, with no time to try and tame them back to un-smooshed length and curl.These silk sleep masks solve both of those major nap issues. They keep the light out, while being oh so comfortable to wear. I don't notice them, they are light not too tight and don't shift. The silk also keeps my lashes from squishing, they just glide over the silk.So comfortable, so nice looking and feeling, I feel like a 50s screen star, I'm just a glamorous napper.
297. The first bag i ordered was bright orange and felt and worked great as a natural vitamin C. The second and third bag i ordered were brown in color with a very different taste and smell. Not consistent and really disappointed in the quality control. Also the color of powder does not match color in product image.But I love terrasoul products so I will buy their camu camu powder nstead which is supposed to have 3x more vitamin C then acerola cherry.
298. I have very small eyes, so I haven't been able to find an eyelash curler that works for me. I had very high hopes for this product. But, it doesn't curl my lashes at all. AND, the first time I used it, I used it too long and my eyes puffed up from the heat. I guess I actually burned my eye lid. It also says to use after applying mascara in the directions, but when I tried this, my mascara came off. Like I said, I really wanted this product to work for me, but it just didn't~
299. Unfortunately, these didn't work, and I returned them. First, if you have a larger roll of paper, they're not large enough to fit around the roll.Second, the cutter wrinkles and tears the paper instead of delivering a clean cut.
300. All of Dr Axe products are reliable.  THESE WORK.  Period.
301. The gloves are soft, wash up nicely. Serve the purpose of hand lotion treatment at night very well. They come in small boxes, making it easy to pack and take with. Thanks!
302. Been using this since our baby was a newborn. Although I know this company was under some scrutiny a while ago, I still think this is a great product. We haven't really had much diaper rashes, but when we did, this took care of it. It's a thicker consistently when the tube is new, but over time, it can become more liquid-y, especially in warmer temperatures and it turns to like an oil, so best to keep in a cooler place. Also, sometimes when the tube gets really old and low, there are some grainy things. I'm not sure if that's because the product has dried out a bit. Overall, I think this is a good diaper rash ointment or preventative ointment. It also goes on clear so you baby's butt isn't covered in like white.
303. Great product! It is sturdy and just high enough for me. I love the handle as I have poor balance. The person that said to step on it before you depend on the handle is correct. I am happy I bought this.
304. Really cool product. No complaints. I love the style too.
305. Great product speedy delivery would rest again
306. use this for nail art!
307. This is such a great scale. It is very light weight and the numbers are easy to read.
308. I tried first day! Super cute and really comfortable!
309. I use this product for keeps drain traps filled in the science lab. The extra heavy formula helps it stay in place and fill the large space in the pipe.
310. Good quality hair support.
311. This product is amazing!! We moved into a home that has some funky smells going on in it. I opened this up in the bedroom, and since then I haven’t smelled anything bad on my whole upper floor! Every now and again I catch a clean scent, but for the most part it just smells like nothing. The absence of an odor, which is just what I was hoping for!
312. Nice unit - except the bracket is too narrow to hold WaterPic and similar showerheads which renders it useless for me.Too bad, really, that the distributor and manufacturer don't take the time to let potential purchasers know this, because they refuse to take returns on this item.Too bad, really, because the unit is otherwise acceptable. The suction cup adheres well and the bracket allows a fair range of adjustment gfor the showerhead - if you have one that fits the bracket.Jerry
313. I am very happy with this supplement. I have purchased from this company before and have never had issues. Magnesium is great to help with muscle soreness.
314. It's was ok. Wasn't thick enough and doesn't wrap all the way around table. I've had better ones.
315. Seems silly to write a review for a sleep mask, but this one is worth it -- and I feel obligated to share it with ya all who are shopping for one.  I have been a sleep-mask addict for 10 years (that's what having a child can do to you, evidently). I literally cannot fall asleep without one. This &#34;Earth Therapeutics&#34; is the one and only for me (but I have 5 of them, ha ha!) Sleep masks are either too slippery, don't stay on, too transparent, not enough coverage, too uncomfortablethick (too much coverage), or too small or too big or not adjustable around my head to fit right. It's neat that it has a soft side (I love during cooler weather) and a satin side (great for warmer weather). It's the perfect size ... not too little but not too big. I don't like to notice the sleep mask, it has to feel natural. I tried the memory-foam type ones and ones that seem sort of molded for &#34;comfort,&#34; and they were awful. What's more -- they last. They last through washes, the velcro and elastic are not &#34;cheap,&#34; they are strong and stay solid. I have had the same mask (my first one, a pink one, which was a gift) for over 5 years and it's still going strong. I have 5 of them just to rotate and keep them washed to keep my skin clean at night. I can't even recommend a runner-up ... this is the end-all, be-all.P.S. If you try the masks with the headphones (so you can listen to tunes as you fall asleep), I just want to say how disappointed I was. I couldn't find a good, comfortable mask with built-in headphones. So when I want music at night, I just use headphones separately. Let me know if you find a great Earth Therapeutics light-weight sleep mask with built in headphones that don't add bulk and annoyance, ha ha!
316. It works!!
317. These are very poorly made and thin material. Would not stay up and do nothing to help with knee pain.
318. Normally I just love gummy vitamins but these don't taste very good.  I like the vitamins and omega-3's they contain, all that is very good.  They just don't taste good.  I immediately get a fishy flavor (got to be from the algae they are made from) followed by some serious tartness.  Though they are still palatable, why consume these when there are other gummy vitamins that are just as good and taste a lot better?  If you don't mind tartness and a little fishy flavor then I highly recommend these.
319. Looks like this Hibiscus powder is new on the market and I decided to give it a try. It shipped quickly and was packaged well. I found it to be of a very good quality, it has a nice intense color and smells like freshly ground. This is a true super-food with tons of good benefits. It works great on my hair and I also like adding it to my morning smoothies and teas. Definitely I would recommend it!
320. We really like this mountain falls 30 Spf sun screen.Made in USA.Love the scent. Its fresh and clean. Seems to go in the skin, is not greasy. and  My skin does not feel dry after using this,as other SPF have left my skin feeling.Apply 15 mins before going out in the sun.If swimming,  reapply after 80 mins.We live on a river in California, and its hot and sunny here. I live on a river.I put this on 3 children .One is a red head, blue eyes, One child has platinum blonde hair, and fair.The children had on  tee shirts ,but using this they did notGet Sunburned around the neck or arms being in the river. A bit red yes, but Not sunburned.You can get sunburned through the window while driving.I put sunscreen on my hands for years, and have very little brown spots on my hands for my age.
321. Looking to get some “good for you” stuff added to my routine, I decided to get this.Now, for the price – I’m not exactly impressed. It does smell rank, but when I mixed it with milk, it tasted pretty good. Even my mother was impressed.I did feel a bit more energetic and it was easy to use.This isn’t something I would get again, but it wasn’t as bad as I thought for my first protein powder go around.
322. This is good. I keep it on my desk and chew it to get rid of coffee breath. Ha.
323. Helped with anxiety, stress, and relaxation. Highly recommended!  Very good quality.
324. Useless as a smoothing brush on curly hair or regular hair. Tried it on child's long hair, it just got tangled in it. Tried it on my average hair, and it did nothing.
325. Like this hard-to-find mouthwash so much. Leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean. Tart taste. Just right, though
326. I feel that taking these towards evening helps me to sleep better. It takes the edge off some of those racing thoughts that happened to many of us at night. Along with melatonin, this product is helping get some Z's.
327. Repeat buy. Helps me keep up immunity working in healthcare
328. VERY CHEAP, does not give correct weight. Total waist of money....
329. This is better than nothing. I have a garden tub with nonslip bottom. No one would be able to sit in a tub with a nonslip surface. It doesn’t stick too well on the fiberglass but I can deal with that. Overall, it makes the tub very inviting and serves my purpose.
330. This is a great product. I have tried several different straightening devices to straighten my beard this one is the best one. Definitely worth the money. It heats up quickly and if you forget to turn it off they even have a automatic shut-off
331. Had to throw them away because they smelled like smoke so bad. The box was yellow but unopened.
332. Pretty nice device and my face felt relaxed after the massage. Took me a minute to figure out of to use this device but after the learning phase went into action. Got my face muscle to relax and did a bit in the neck also. Take a while to get used to this device but is worth it. Good quality and came in a nice box.
333. I  tried to remove the balls off of a sweater and a T-shirt. It damaged the sweater so bad I had to buy my son a new one. It’s like running piece of metal with jagged teeth on your clothes.
334. This Shiatsu Neck and Back Massager has 4 massage nods help get a nice deep muscle massage and an added heat option to help blood circulation.  It has a car charger that allows you to operate it in your car and a strap to secure it.  This comes with a massager pillow, power cord, car adapter and  easy to understand directionsI have a lot of back and neck pain and boy does this help it.  It just massaged the tightness and pain from them.  It has strong. powerful rollers and a one minute timer which switches directions of the rollers after a minute.This is not cordless, you must be near an outlet to use this.I received this neck and back massager to use, review and to give my honest opinion about it.
335. In short: open reservoir cup makes it easy to add water, keep clean, and to allow dry between uses. Can adjust strength. Slim design makes it easy to maneuver around mouth. Takes up little room. Can be packed up for on the go use. Loud, but similar to my corded tank style.I use water flossers all the time. The best (to me) is a particular name brand that has a tank, and is plugged in. I keep that in my main bathroom that has a plug nearby. Since I rely greatly on water flossing, I wanted to have one in my 1st floor bathroom, which is like the size of a closet, and has no counter, and no plugs. So, I have been tried cordless flossers for use in that bathroom.Here is the thing I find with most of them: the water reservoirs are bulky and are hard to clean. I dont care that they dont hold much water. That is easy enough to deal with, but to have an enclosed cup that really can ever be cleaned out? gross. Then I tried one where there , and that works really well for my needs. That one wins out over this due to one aspect- it is fully cordless. When I saw this Hangsun water flosser I decided to try it--it has appearance of regular plug in, but an open water top that makes me feel better about it drying between uses. I didnt need another flosser, but I wanted to find out more about it and report back in a review.SO, this may be for you if you are (like me) in wanting a CORDLESS* flosser with an open water reservoir. I can easily add more water to it, it is easy to clean, and it dries between uses. Charge has been long lasting, so I like that I dont need to fuss. It is nice for use in no-plug areas. While cordless, I still feel attached, as I need to set the base down. Doubt I would use this in shower. With my other one, I may need to supply my own cup for water, but it can be any size, and I can use it in shower just by cupping my hand.Kinda loud-- similar to my plug in name brand one.I tend to only ever use one head- the slightly curved one. Havent tried the other options, and likely wont.Of the half dozen cordless flossers I have tried (including a name brand cordless), I like this one, and the one I linked to the best. I use them secondary to my plug in.
336. I'm a big fan of mint and a big fan of chocolate.  Many see Girl Scout Thin Mints as the apex of chocolate-mint cookiedom, but I was looking for something more.  I think I've found it in these York Peppermint Pattie cookies.  The cookies consist of a chocolate cookie, covered with mint creme and dipped in chocolate.  Here's what's so great about them.  First, these cookies are dipped in dark chocolate, which I, personally, prefer to milk chocolate.  Second, they have a nice layer of mint creme, which gives a nice texture compliment to the crunchy cookie.  Third, the mint creme is a true, strong peppermint- great for those who love their mint.  Overall, this is a great cookie.  I'd happily munch one anytime.
337. I am a size 12 and it barely fit
338. Pros:- made in USA- no smell or after taste- veggie based capsules- male vitality blend- immune blend- antioxidant blendCons:- larger sized- only 30 day supply even though you get 60 capsules
339. Is what your back muscles and spine will say!Be smart, use as advised. Made of dark greyblack Styrofoam.
340. I absolutely love this. Smells so good and makes for a very good nights sleep. I just spray the bed every night
341. I used to love this alpiste milk but for some reason they added guar gum and now it’s too thick, i liked the previous one, it was a much lighter version, so much better, I hope they can bring it back!For those who do enjoy thicker milks, this is great for liver cleanse, loosing, and keeping extra weight off.
342. I'm so glad I got these! They last just as long as the original battery, and it's invaluable to have extra batteries when you're places without electricity such as camping trips! If you have the camera, it's worth the few bucks to get the extra batteries. I got an exceptional price!
343. Received the device a couple of days ago.  Stumbled around a little bit to get the hang of it but it's easy when you know what you are doing.  Purchased this one because of the many positive reviews.  Good choice.  I'm just wearing it now to see how I do normally.  I can't believe I am such a low stepper.  No wonder I've seen a weight gain.  Darn the reality of sitting at a computer all day.  When you can &#34;see&#34; for yourself what you are doing or more importantly NOT doing it really is a motivator.  Grandma was slow but she was old - I hope to reverse some of that old saying.
344. I got this free at CVS using extra bucks, but that price still seems too high. Mine had no mechanical problems, and the vibrations were pretty strong. It shook the entire table, which makes me wonder if it should be containing that vibration and channeling it into the jewelry more efficiently. It’s important to note that the cvs price was only 7.99, and I got it half off after Christmas for basically four bucks. I tried it first with just warm water. No change, my jewelry still had some grime. Then tried with a drop of Dawn, same result. The photo in my review is after two cycles, the debris in the lid is from dropping it while trying to open it, that wasn’t actually removed by the device. I also experienced difficulty removing the lid, but i was able to get it apart with just my hands. Save your money, don’t get it.
345. I cannot tell if it’s picking up anything. Dirt is still there after spraying and wiping... it smells great though.
346. Pro:Secure fitComfortable to wear4 LayersCons:Cannot think of any !!
347. I was hoping this was the original formula, but it is not. I used this detergent with my last 2 kids so I know the smell of it, and this one is not the same. I loved the old smell, which last longer on the clothes after washing. This one fades away; I can barely smell it after the clothes come out of the washer. Also, the original formula is much more concentrated, therefore you only need to use a little bit. I used more with this one. As for packaging, it arrived well packaged in plastic so there was NO leak.
348. Works exactly as advertised, zero smoke.  Not sure how long it lasts but out of the package I’d call it a miracle product.  Surprise bonus was the smoke buddy keychain, great entertainment posing him after using the smoke buddy.
349. When I decided to order them, I must have misread the directions.  Once I received them, I discovered that the daily amount is three.  That  means a package is a twenty day supply.  To me that is too expensive and the taste really isn't that great.  I didn't take them long enough to determine how helpful they will be.
350. WOW these are amazing.
351. I bought this as a replacement to my original strap and it works great!
352. Works well in dishwasher and leaves dishes and glassware clean and sparkly. Have used this product for years.
353. I purchased this scale on April 10, 2016. Today is May 16, 2017 and my scale no longer works. I changed the batteries when they died and now when you stand on the scale it says scanning, step off, thinking and then err. Like many others I reset the scale, reset it up, left batteries out etc. I sought out the help page on Fitbit. 5 pages of people with the same problem. No response from Fitbit. I am very angry that my 13 month old $123 scale no longer works. I just bought a $17 digital scale to replace this. Bad show Fitbit.6117 Update: Fitbit reached out to me and sent me a replacement scale no charge after we tried a few things to reboot my original scale. Their customer service has been fantastic and was wonderful to work with. I really appreciate the good faith and of course the new scale. I will gladly purchase their products again.
354. I received this set undamaged and in good working order. I tried the different heads included, and have to say that it definitely works as intended. You are using electricity, so please follow all safety guidelines and do not use it for things it was not intended. Much like a tens unit, this unit sends current into the skin. At its lowest settings, you merely feel a slight pleasant vibration. I lack the courage to try it at its highest setting because it would surely give a pretty significant jolt. In between those extremes, there are several settings that create a good working base for a variety of uses. For instance, it gives instructions on aging or delicate skin, when applying serums, and when trying to alleviate pain.The booklet is pretty clear on its warnings, suggestions, and instructions. The box it came in has a magnetic closure, dense foam to cradle the different FRAGILE glass heads, and the unit itself. It will take some experimentation with to find the optimum level of comfort and efficacy.
355. Butter, no pecan. Blcch!
356. It's not bad. I haven't felt any 'results' as others have so I am going on faith that it will deliver benefits over time. You must mix it with berries or something, the taste by itself is a little rustic for me. I make it as a keto smoothie with some heavy whipping cream, fruit, water, a touch of stevia. Doable.
357. It’s much thinner than I was hoping for but should do the trick if I double or triple layer it.  But that will only make the usable length 13 what is listed.:
358. just as shown and just as stated, the suction cups could be better but the price was right
359. I like how this makes me feel , great stuff.
360. Was having good success with Bulletproof Stress Gummies, but they contained "malitol" so I started looking for a viable substitute.  THIS brand seemed pretty close.  Same "Sensoril Ashwagandha" just more, same l-theanine, a little more B6, plus the addition of GABA and magnesium.I find this blend helps with anxiety that started for me with peri-menopause.  The kind of irrational anxiety that you KNOW is just anxiety ... the sudden dwelling on all things bad & stressful, the sense of impending doom ... THIS blend helps a LOT with that.  I also find it useful as my brains leans toward overstimulation ... I probably would have been labeled "autistic" as a 70s child had it been a thing.  My brain does not shift gears well.  It is not good at surprises.  Although I cope and try to be rational when hubs asks me to do something suddenly, my brain just won't let me sometimes.  I call it my "gears jamming" ... THIS supplement helps that.  It backs my brain down of the ledge and makes me think reasonably again.Overall ... super pleased with these.  They are just what I was looking for.
361. This is really great stuff.  It is natural.  It works.  I learned about it years ago when I was going to fly.  Now I fly more often and am in a car traveling on all kinds of roads and in mountains at times and it is just really wonderful to help keep motion sickness away.  It even works on ships as well.  his is really a wonderful find.  it is simple, nothing I have to wear like a wrist thing, not a pill where I could have side effects just simply an oil I put behind my ears.  I make sure I am always stocked up on this wonderful stuff.  I suggest it to anyone who may have a need.
362. You can't expect quality products if it's super cheap, especially organic Acerola. I take the Acerola tabs but sometimes I rather just mix it in my drinks. This is very tart so I recommend mixing it with juice and also using a whisk. It can clump very easily. It really does give me energy. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so this is a great alternative to energy drinks. Doesn't mess with my glucose levels and I don't crash on this. The benefits of Acerola are amazing and I recall hardly getting sick living in Puerto Rico, because we had a large Acerola tree in our back yard. My mom use to juice them and we ate them as a family on a daily basis. Miss that tree!
363. My son has chafing issues and this fixed his problem. Desitin is very messy but this stuff dries and helps the skin glide when rubbing together. He hasn't had pain ever since I bought this.
364. This review is more to clarify someone else’s review bc they didn’t understand understand the labeling!  It shows 1000mg as advertised & another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium!  I realize not everyone takes chemistry, but 4 ppl liked his review & so misinformation is spreading.  This works. If however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr & ask for a medication called Linzess which works must better & must faster, but is unnecessary for most people.  If magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food & drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.  Staying hydrated will really help.  Before switching to Linzess I used to take one 1,000 mg pill am & pm every day with meals & always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid.
365. I really like these. They are similar to other brands but cheaper and I feel like they work better than other brands.They are somewhat hard to remove but thats with any brand. I did notice a whiter smile.
366. These work okay. I used them twice and they are a bit awkward at first but you have to wear a long sleeve tee or other type of sweater otherwise they are noticeable. Take a little while to get used to but after a few minutes they prove to be comfortable.
367. Awesome! Heavy! Very good quality! It's so nice to have something to use for all my oils. Should probably get another one soon
368. Love this mask.  Fits well without any gaps
369. I was nervous ordering these but they came perfect for my items I sell. The color is accurate and bags are not to thin. Great for lip gloss
370. Very uncomfortable.
371. These little brooms are awesome! Work better than any I've ever purchased! The price is also great as you get two sets! I love mine!
372. Remote control worked great
373. Not Recommended
374. I had a brick hearth under an old wood burner, removed the wood burner and installed a propane stove, several bricks and the mortar in some areas were a mess, I liked the old brick but had to do a bunch of repairs then grind off the excess mortar and some high spots in the brick. The result was some brick looked brand new, some mortar was pale and newly ground down the whole thing looked really rough, I used less than 13 of the bottle applied with a cheap paint brush, it now looks like the whole thing was nicely done 25 or more years ago. I can't believe how well this stuff works. The real test of its look is, Momma loves it!
375. I use files to file my 4 month old's nails instead of clipping them, and I absolutely love glass files the best! They stand up to the test of time, and are so nice and solid. Very thankful to have found these!
376. This is my favorite tissue.  I suffer from allergies and when the season is at its worst, I need this tissue to keep me from getting a sore nose.  This is a wonderful tissue!
377. Mybat is once again perfect for my new phone...3 phones in 5 years. The phone cover is 13 of the price at the phone seller place.This is my second Mybat phone cover and perfecto again.  See you again in two years, I hope.More.  Ok.  The cover flips over the phone and the inside has 3 sections to drop a credit card  or a pic of your pet armadillo.
378. I mixed a heaping scoopful in some cold, filtered water and it took some stirring but finally seemed to dissolve.  It turned the water a beautiful cherry red but it did not taste like cherries.  It tastes a lot like beets (since beets are the primary ingredient) and I could detect the flavor of the soil they were grown in.  I've grown organic beets in my raised beds and I never could get the dirt taste completely out of them so I'm not complaining.  As far as sweetness goes, there was very little despite it being sweetened with Stevia.  I will be putting this into my smoothies and kefir smoothies from now on since it's flavor is not all that good but the ingredients are top notch.
379. Loved this pattern!  Washed and used it and no issues, worked as intended.
380. These work great for me. I have tried so many I wont buy anything else ever again.
381. This is significantly better than any recorded white noise that I've ever found.  This product actually pushes air, instead of just playing a recorded noise, and it works perfectly for someone who needs noise to studyworksleepetc.If you are looking for your sound machine to multitask, i.e. also be an alarm clock, this is not for you, but I would purchase this and an additional alarm clock because it's that good!
382. Great scent, you only need 1-2 drops of oil for a strong scent 😀
383. I really loved this product. By far the best one I've owned. It looked great with my mascara. I could not be happier with it.
384. I find my focus increased and my energy way up when I take 2 capsules. I appreciate that the ingredients are listed with amounts rather than a proprietary blend of ingredients.I’m a huge fan! I also noticed my appetite greatly reduced.
385. It helps take some pressure off my back...The only reason why I have 3 stars is because I can't sit with this belt for more than 15 or it starts to give me cramps and allot of pressure on my stomach ...So Everytime you sit down you have to take it off, that's the only bad thing
386.  These really aren't too shabby. The cleaning sheets are as expected--I read through the product description before ordering.  I think I have used something similar in the past as it felt rather intuitive to use. Just add a sheet to water, it instantly dissolves. I think 1 sheet per gallon, give or take. Can be stuffed into a cleaning bottle for a spray solution, or can be added to a bucket. Smells nice, works well. Small pressure zip plastic packaging. Little footprint. Really no waste.I have used it primarily on counter tops and tubs. While it mentions floors and walls, I just use it as a basic cleaner--seems gentle enough. My rag picks up a lot of dirt, so I know it is effective. Current price of $5 for 30 sheets makes this a budget friendly option, especially if looking for something that doesn't take up much space, or plan to use it in a spray bottle. Of course, there are liquid concentrates that would offer same. But hey, I thought it worth pointing out.I really think it is an ok product!Lack of directions is a concern, though. I dont mind information in another language other than English. If I can't figure it out, then using a translator app, I pass my phone over it.  Odd thing is, there aren't any instructions. The most info you get on this product is what you see here on the product page. There is no workable information printed on the package. So I dont down rate because of the info not being in English, I down rate because there simply is no info! I will include a picture of the translated text. But even so, I think nearly anyone couldshould be able to figure this product out."Water-Soluble Cleaning Sheet: Concentrated cleaning sheet will quickly dissolves upon contact with water and is immediately ready for your cleanup job"I DO  like these cleaning sheets. I clean homes for a living, and while I dont always need my own cleaners, I do keep a few in my tool kit. Having the option of mixing something up on the go, and having no added weight or mess to carry around is highly appealing.  I would even tear off half a sheet and add it directly to a toilet. It does dissolve instantly, easily, and smells good and fresh. Not too strong. No need to rinse.lovely product, overall. 4 stars
387. Bought as a gift for my husband. He loves them
388. My elderly disabled mother (5' 225 lbs.)  has no issues using this.  It is sturdy and very helpful for her getting in and out of her bed.
389. This is a nice ice roller. It rollsspins without effort and doesn’t stick, even when very cold. Compared to another I have, this handle is easier to hold as it’s made for a normal grip (I have another one where the handle is somewhat triangle shaped). The freezer case is especially nice, as you can store it without worry of food contact. It doesn’t take up much room in the freezer. I recommend this model.
390. Got this for my husband so he can have his meds really for the month. And he likes this makes it so much nicer than doing them by the week.  He's happy.  And it works so well and with the little compartments being able to come out to take your pills that is nice as well.  You don't have to mess with trying to get your pills out by holding the whole thing.
391. I purchased this for my husband as he was looking to try a new creatine. He’s been taking it daily and has so far seen some pretty decent results. The taste is good, dissolves fairly well in water (which often times is a challenge with creatine in general). Overall it’s a little early to really tell how well this is working out, but it seems to be just fine. I’ll update the review with more info once more time has passed from taking it!
392. I have IBS. it sucks. being regular is apparently more important that i thought it would be. wtf right? anyway i take fiber gummies because of this. Theyre yummy. dont leave them in the sun though. its gummy it will melt.
393. Bought for older relative who was having issues with mouth sores.
394. Works like it's supposed to.
395. I love them, nicer than the black ones.  Been using them for more then 3 years.
396. This sleep mask is one of the most adorable ones I've ever seen. It has a 3D effect because the floppy ears are attached separately to the mask and jut out. It's really cute and would be appreciated by dog lovers as well as fans of the Disney movie. The price is a little high for this type of thing but otherwise it's a fun sleep mask, especially for children. Now if only they made a cat version based on "the Aristocats"
397. We wanted a first aid bag that we could fill for our dog. Its roomy and just what we needed.
398. This Freshcap Unwind instant drink mix tastes very good.  It's slightly sweet and no where near being too sweet.  Some people may want to add a little more sweetener to it.  I mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it completely dissolved leaving no mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup.  It nearly has the color of coffee and when I added a little cream to it it looked exactly like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but without the caffeine.  The product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix (I guess that means Reishi and Chaga) but it doesn't say per serving.  Nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving.  I'm assuming that you get 1000 mg of Reishi and Chaga per tube.  I looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules I have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so I guess one tube also contains 1000 mg.  Overall I think this is a good product, especially useful right before bedtime to promote a better night's sleep, and it tastes good too.
399. I do not often eat nutrition bars but when I need to, these are the ones I select.  They are not too sweet, chock full of good little crunchy things and priced well.  I cannot find them in retail stores even tho I shop at "organic" groceries and wonder why they are not more widely available.
400. My French class was reading a few of the children's stories upon which this film is based.  After watching the film, the consensus was this is a good film, if not great.  Might be better suited for an audience of children than adults.  That is probably for whom it was intended.
401. But I don't get a lot of support from it. For your knee, you need more support than what this brace offers. The side supports are not metal, they are a plastic and bend easily enough. I don't fight the fit to be very good and am disappointed in this knee brace.
402. I have used sea moss Gummies before,  but I must admit that I was a little scared to try the real thing.  Since I like to keep my diet in the raw as much as possible,  I decided to give this a shot.  Honestly,  it's basically tasteless.  It has a very faint oceany flavor that I barely notice.  If I put it in a smoothie,  I don't notice it at all.  The texture reminds me of chia seed jam.  It works really well as a thickener in smoothie bowls and pudding. If you are gluten free,  it's a good way to thicken soups as well.  The serving size is very low so this bag should last a long time.
403. I had given her mom one previously but she said she had never seen it because mommy keeps everything for herself. That is a 12 year old's opinion. So, I got her this one and if she can't get those blackheads our of her face with the machine, then she use the tools that are included.
404. always use them extra soft
405. I found that this traction device is of the utmost highest quality than all the rest. Also if you have any questions you can contact the company and they will assist you.  My surgery liked it so good the he was going to recommend it to his other patients.  It is easy to adjust up and down and very comfortable as much as traction can be. I have tried several others and this is by far the best for a soft traction device.
406. I used it maybe 10 times and it stopped working. I used a small torx screwdriver and took the screw out of the bottom and used a small flat screw driver to put in the slot to slide the cutter head off of the plastic base. I took my old razor head (tabs broke off like everyone elses) and compared and they are very similar. But whatever grease they are using fails pretty quickly and becomes sticky causing the hair to get stuck. I suppose you could clean their grease off and use a white lithium grease or something and it would work fine but I just decided to swap my old OEM cutter head into the new plastic base. Works great now!
407. (4.5)These Zep cleaners that came in the Zep cleaning bundle work perfectly. Just like brand names, if not better than some.This bundle comes with an all purpose cleaner and a streak free glass cleaner. The all purpose cleaner is a degreaser as well and it works brilliantly! We had grease splatter on the stove top and I was dreading the clean up but figured it would be a great test for this stuff. I gave it a spray, let it sit for 60 seconds, attempted a wipe up, and wow! The grease came right up. I was impressed. I wasn't 100% in love with the smell but the cleaning power sold me.The glass cleaner I would definitely say is in line with other blue glass cleaners. It only streaked if I wiped it really poorly (I can streak any windowmirrorglass surface imaginable, I am so bad at that). It had the normal smell that you would expect. I liked it a lot.I thought both these cleaners were very good. I'm not sure about the price and how it compares to other cleaners though. Even though I definitely recommend these for their cleaning power, I did have to take just a tad off for the slightly higher cost.
408. I ordered this because I have a hip replacement coming up and, after checking out the walkers Medicare would provide for me, decided this is a much better option. While I've only tried it out so far, I am pleased with its appearance and solidity. It is very sturdy and, with the back wheels being further apart than are the front wheels, there is more room for me. Another feature that I really like is that I can pull up on the strap in the middle of the seat and fit it through a narrow bathroom door, while still using it for support. While this is a heavy nylon seat--and not padded--it and the back fit me well and provide solid lumbar support. Someone else looked at it today and was quite impressed. She said they paid over $500 for a walker for her brother that was flimsy, with metal that quickly bent, so that the thing was useless. She plans to get one of these for her mother. The only downside seems to be that the included cupholder can't be put on without loosening a strange-looking screw--we have to find a screwdriver that will fit it. A cane holder is also included. The velcro-attached bag is good sized. If you want to go to the hassle of removing 8 screw--gizmos with large plastic heads (they are easy to do) and lower the arms, it will fit in the included bag.
409. Perfect, we need this because the toilet is very low, good product
410.  This is the 56th BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE- One BP unit- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet- One large cuff- One cloth carry pouch- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA BatteriesFEATURES- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.- The display is large.- Accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors.- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.NEGATIVES- The cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance.- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator. What happens is that after three readings, the first number displayed is the average. The next three numbers and beyond are the readings. Once I cycle through all the readings, the average is never displayed again unless I turn off the unit and then press the memory button again.- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.For those who are interested, I attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5-star monitors. These monitors I consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others I tested. I listed two 4-star monitors because they have unique features such as Spanish speaking or Bluetooth. Each one of these monitors is accurate and I would highly recommend any of them. – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. It does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. The arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people.  – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. Accuracy is spot on, which is atypical of wrist monitors.  – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor.  -This is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources (4 AAA batteries or AC cable), and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each. (4.5 stars) - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. The LCD Display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green, yellow, and red based on the hypertension level—which is EXCELLENT. There are two power options. It takes four AAA batteries or a USB Type C cable (both are included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in AMPM (not military time). The cuff size is large. There is an irregular heartbeat indicator. Accuracy is spot on.  – This is one unique monitor. The monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the iOS or Android app (viHealth). The cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small. Operation is simple. This is rechargeable and comes with the USB Type C cable for charging. There is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app. There is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app. In fact, the readings can be associated with multiple users (number and amount unknown). The date and time are automated through the Bluetooth pairing with the app. As of June 2022, the app is quirky and does not always connect. The BP unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone. The  is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulation(TENS) option. (Both are 4 stars) - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. The LCD Display is large and easy to read. There are two power options of either four AA batteries (NOT included) or a micro-USB cable (included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in 24-hour clock (military time) only. The cuff size is large and will fit most users. There is also voice broadcast mode and two alarm options. This does not have an irregular heartbeat indicator.  (4.5 stars)
411. Did not work.  I returned this item
412. I had high hopes for this as I suffer from neck pain that radiates up into my head at times. May be stress maybe misalignment. Not sure but it didn’t help me with my problem. It’s possible it needs to be used for a longer period of time to get any results but it’s very uncomfortable and a few times I felt  like it almost made it worse. Maybe it was just not  a good match for my problem but for my personal experience I cannot say it helped.
413. This is a good kit that has the heavy duty metal rasp and the finer sandpaper type on the 2 sided tool.  My husbands feet get cracked on heelscalluses during winter and mine more so in summer from wearing sandals..This is the perfect thing for using in the shower or just sitting down and taking care of yr feet.  The nail brush also included, is used almost every day and really is handy to have.
414. If I could give this 10 Stars I would! This is the second product I purchased to clean our Napoleon wood burning fireplace glass doors. The first product required harsh scrubbing and many reapplications to get the soot off. With this product the soot practically falls off, no scrubbing, absolutely effortless. Amazing product.
415. Just received this and so far love it! It had a charge, but I charged it overnight in my phone charger and used every accessory the next day. It still had plenty of power left 15-20min. of playing around with it. No pain with any and the facial hair remover worked great (no redness or hair seen 2 days later). I’m 53, dark haired with light complexion. The nose trimmer piece came apart when I went to put it on and it was tricky putting it back together, but I eventually got it. Not my favorite to use, but it works! Not sure about the eyebrow trimmer but I didn’t buy it for that. I didn’t try the body shaver as I had shaved my legs & underarms that day. So far I am very happy with this purchase and feel it’s a great buy overall! Would definitely recommend
416. A great collection of Ingredients in one mix ... I'm a 330 lb Male and 1 dose Gives me a good (non-jittery) energy boost, and even if I'm hungry I won't want to eat_ I don't workout, I just  take this at work about mid-shift since I have a Physically fast paced job and it keeps me going goodTHE TASTE:Rotten Raspberry - Lemon RindYeah, it's bad....However - with a simple trick you can get it tasting actually good....REMEDY For Bad Taste:When I mix me a concoction of this stuff I use an 18.5 OZ PLASTIC BOTTLE and fill it 60% full of FILTERED WATER_I use a KITCHEN FUNNEL and scoop into the bottle 1-12 scoops of the ROOTZ MIX and shake well_Get some POWDERED WELCH'S GRAPE DRINK MIX (it's actually low sugar per scoop), and scoop about only 12 - 34 a Scoop (provided in container) into the bottle via Funnel_ Shake well, fill up with Filtered Water, shake well again_This will neutralize the awful bitterness & tartness without making it sweet or loading it with sugar_If you prefer it sweet you can add a little more Grape Mix_As for a Remedy for the graininess .... If it's annoying then get a small Marble Mocaljete and pummel the powder finer_ I haven't done this yet but it's a logical solutionI only gave it 4 *'s because it seems that the makers could easily remedy the terrible taste & graininess pretty easily so for lack of a little effort I couldn't rate it 5*
417. Pro: easy to use and lightweightCon: just keeps me from moving my head without turning my shoulders. Neck brace. Doesn't pull my neck up for adjustment like I thought it would.
418. This is something my husband takes with his vitamin regiment.  He likes the taste.
419. This is a very nice toothpaste. It is definitely funky using toothpaste that is black but you get used to it. It tastes pretty good and cleanse your teeth very well. I would recommend mixing it up with regular toothpaste though because it can strip your teeth because of the charcoal. It does have some bad breath eliminating features which I like and it can help whiten your teeth, don't expect to have like bright white teeth because of this but it can neutralize some stains which is nice. I really like this one but I am not making this my own and only toothpaste but actually rotate it with another one I use.
420. Complete waste of money does nothing just like wearing a regular pair of socks
421. This is a great product ! Very powerful , please follow the mixing and use instructions .
422. The product you get comes in three syringes. You apply 1ml to a spoon and eat the gel. It's fussy, and kind of weirdly flavored. The whole syringe thing is weird. It is best refrigerated after you open each syringe. Yes, I believe it is a good product and effective! However, the delivery system is really most suitable for people who have syringe fetishes and a lot of time on their hands. I'd much prefer to have had the product in a softgel.
423. I got this for my wife who was in the process to quit smoking.  She said the setup for this device was straight forward and the app is easy to use. The device is accurate, if she had a cigarette, the CO 2 numbers would be higher. For her, the CO2 number was a clear reminder of the progress that she was making. Overall she recommends this as it helped her quit smoking.
424. I was so glad to find this supplement at this high dose.  I'm taking this several times a day now, every day, and can tell it is beginning to help with insomnia, foggy feeling, and concentration.  The main purpose in taking this, however, is long term, as it is supposed to prevent disabling memory loss.  And I'll do anything I can for that.  This brand seems to be top quality, and to know what they're talking about.
425. It feeds your body what it might be lacking. Its overall something should be apart of your daily routine. I would get it again
426. Came in my monthly box. Works as intended. Box wasn't damaged. Seals were intact.
427. These are posted & listed with "33% more loads" with 66 as total.  I received 2 of the regular size with 25 loads (50 total loads).  Please correct the listing to reflect the normal size bottles.
428. The foot bath is nicely designed. Only issue I have is that I like the temperature at 90 degrees. Even when I set the temperature to 90 degrees, it heats up to more than 100 degrees (see photo). There may be an issue with the thermostat.
429. It’s SO hard to find a chapstick that is both cruelty free and vegan, so while I did consider these a bit pricy for chapstick it’s definitely worth it!!! Most of the flavors are amazing- I especially love the peach coconut one. However, the patchouli one is kind of strange. It smellstastes like I just smeared incense on my lips, and not in a good way. It almost has a smell that seems like it should not be going on my lips. Like I said though, the other scents are amazing and very moisturizing. Definitely will be buying more of these!
430. Too too strong to wear I get a headache and lose balance and eyes need to re-adjust
431. works well, nice good deal
432. This product contains lead! Completely shocked it’s still on the market and being sold. Disgusted that this product is being sold on amazon
433. Just right shape for shoulders, and it holds heat well
434. This powder mixes in well, although the directions say to mix in two whole scoops. It tastes pretty good, except that it does have a bit of that protein flavor.All in all, it's pretty decent for the price.
435. The rolls are tiny, the paper a bit harsh, but it does the job.
436. These are my favorite whitening strips!!! I have purchased them twice now. I love how gentle they are because my teeth are a little sensitive, and I cannot handle the products that come with LED lights or professional whitening done by a dentist. I have also tried charcoal whitening products, and I found them to be too abrasive. Other brands of whitening strips, such as Crest, I have found too harsh. Mr. Bright strips can be left on for 10-30 minutes, and you can use them occasionally for a "touch-up" or consecutively for the full 14 days. I had to write a review for this product because I recommend it to everyone. Do not expect dramatic results because they are gentle and an OTC item, but they are definitely worth it. I think the results are noticeable, and they last for a few months. I tend to use these a week before a special event or if I just feel like my teeth are looking dull.
437. These are made in China and the quality shows.  The sound is acceptable but not great.  The headphones get hot at times and I am worried about that.  I don't think these are worth $26 dollars but it seems like that is the lowest price going for these.  If you are looking for a cheap headset for a young kid I would get these but don't expect much from them.
438. First of all I’m a chiropractor that specializes in corrective care and this is my new absolute favorite traction device. First of all it’s adjustable so you’ll be able to customize the perfect fit for yourself. And as far as the design goes… It’s comfortable and snug. I noticed immediate relief in tension and increased range of motion. Bravo ChiroLux.
439. I think we've used about every wipe there is to use between the 3 of my children(8 months to 5 years). With newborns, Pampers was my choice. I had to change diapers often, and they worked great at working against diaper rash. Admittedly, though, as my children got older, we gravitated toward Huggies wipes. Pampers seems to have different kinds of wipes. There was one kind that seemed so slimy, we couldn't bear to use it, and it seemed that no matter how hard we tried we ended up with that particular one. We keep wipes just about everywhere and use them on our hands, too(particularly during car rides). We prefer Huggies when it comes to hand use.These are great, though, when it comes to backsides! They ARE a little more on the slimy side than Huggies, but these are more durable. With Huggies wipes, they're constantly tearing or we end up pulling out 4 wipes stuck together.These seem to come apart(from each other)much better. You can tug and pull on these and see just how much more durable they are. We generally have better coupons from Pampers, so we usually end up with Pampers wipes. I'll be honest, though, and say that when we have the coupons, we get Huggies wipes. We like them both for different reasons! We ONLY use one of the two, though. From my experience and opinion, just forget generic brands when it comes to wipes.If your little one has a sensitive backside, though, I highly recommend these! These ARE scented, so if that bothers you, there's the unscented sensitive kind, too.
440. These are great!  They really help with polishing up your skin for the summer!
441. Handy and usefulHolds up well
442. Lots of room for morning and evening medications. Easy to open and stays closed. The cover is good for hiding your pills when you are on vacation. The cover is pretty but I expect it to eventually peel due to being PU leather
443. One of the best tasting low carb bars out there, definitely in the top 5.  Grenade knows how to make a good tasting bar and has spread that knowledge across all flavors - very good!
444. Been looking like crazy for a c-ring of this material... no, it is not just silicone... it is special and it makes the difference! I will order 3 more... (cause I know this one will be stolen)
445. These are really nice maracas. Off to order another pair!
446. Excellent value, low cost, works great.I'm a large person and it covers me perfectly.Very soft, warm and easy to use, no problem with wires getting tangled or feeling hard, uncomfortable while wearing.Can pull down lower to cover top of legs or put all of it on legs for a nice, warm blanketHighly recommend.
447. Package arrived in great condition. Nice amount for the low price. Love these Puffs.
448. I got this for my husband because it has a 550 lb weight capacity so I figured it would be pretty durable. When it arrived, I assembled it and sat on it to try it out. One of the wheels immediately broke… and I am nowhere close to 550 lbs!  I tried to return it but amazon referred me to the manufacturer. The link they provided just took me to the sales website. The phone number rang to a message service. I bought my own set of replacement wheels and it’s working out ok now.
449. they're pretty but don't really affect the smoking experience. the only time you taste it is if you lick it directly
450. Light weight, love the colors and they do not bother my neck when I am wearing them.
451. Really sad this heating pad didn't heat. Very soft and packaged with it's own nylon sleeve, but that doesn't bring relief to achy muscles. Sadly had to return.
452. Started with the spinach and kale chips, the lipo3 spray and the supergreens with beneful. I usually don't eat anything when I am fasting, but I have been having difficulty getting back on track and this should help. After this is out, my South Beach supplies should be here and I can continue eating healthy and lose the weight I wish to lose. By the way, the supergreens are just how I like them. No yucky flavorings to hide the natural grass and chlorella taste.
453. The only thing I really use out of this set is the glass nail file. It works incredibly well. The other multicolored files just take up space. Wasn’t pleased with them.
454. I do my own nail tips and I would recommend this product.
455. I have tried a few different versions of neck traction devicesneck stretchers and have found they all are quite similar with some slight variations in size and design.This one is slightly smaller than others, something that works well for me at 5’-4”. Like the others, it is not soft despite what it may look like. The foam is very hard, as it’s intended to be, in order to support your head and neck and to provide a thorough stretch. There are also some “pressure nodes” on the device which are really just bumps in the foam but are positioned to provide a bit of acupressure and massage while you’re lying on it. Personally, I don’t notice the bumps, but it’s possible they’re doing their job.If you’re new to this type of neck device, know that it takes a while to get used to it. When I first started, it was quite painful, and I managed only a couple of minutes at a time. Now, I use it once or twice a day for about ten minutes at a time. The benefits are immediately noticeable as it relieves the tension in my neck and shoulders that always develops after a day spent at my computer.This particular device, unlike others I have used, comes with a zippered carryingstorage bag, as well as an eye mask and ear plugs. None of these are crucial to the neck traction device, but are nice extras. Some reviewers noted a bad smell when they received their device. I had no such issues with mine.If  you’re looking for a way to relieve neck and shoulder pain without resorting to medication, this is definitely worth a try.
456. I bought this spray to try in my husband's work boots. The scent is a little strong but it seems to do the trick. I just spray the inside of his boots after work and generally the next day, his feet don't smell. The smell could be a little overwhelming for those sensitive to scents.
457. Very cheap and it’s shows, but get the job done
458. Works great so far! I put it on charge before use. Didnt take long, and light turns green when its charged.Lay the clothes flat, turned it on and went over a couple shirts with it in a circular motion. You could hear it when it cuts off a lint ball! Its not loud, Its easy to use, and safe to have around kids because there are no sharp pieces exposed unless you open it to clean it out.Cleaning is also easy- you just unscrew the top and guide the included brush along the sides of it and toss the lint. I actually was shocked at how much came off just a couple of shirts. I'm glad this works because alot of my clothes started to look worn and ugly with the pilling. I've tried an actual razor but that was a pain in the bum. So I'm happy with this product and I've had no issues so far!
459. One thing about, senna gon make you GO! It gets the job done. I mixed it with honey and lemon.
460. It cleaned my shower wonderfully
461. After weighing 250 pounds for the last six years--including during periods when I ate less andor increased my exercise and lost NO weight, I have dropped to 230 in only three months using MCG. I eat whatever I want--although I am dramatically less hungry than I ever used to be and I have virtually no cravings for sweets (unheard-of for me) and I am not exercising at all. Just as a matter of documentation, I'm 46 and 6'4.I have 30 more pounds to lose, and the only reason this is a four-star review instead of a 5-star review is that my weight loss does appear to have stopped. It's been difficult to find clear guidance on whether it's safe to take more of the supplement, and if so, how much more, and that, too, is frustrating. I don't know anything about other brands of this stuff, although I saw a Consumer something or other report in which a couple of the other &#34;top&#34; brands were found by laboratory analysis to have either less or NONE of the active ingredient in them. This particular brand was not included in that study at all.I'm not brand loyal by any means--I don't give a darn who makes it and am more than happy to switch if I find a cheaper manufacturer--but I have stuck with Miracle because it worked at least this far (and I still have three bottles left).To those who tried this and had no benefit, I don't know what to say other than that I am sorry for your lack of results. I regularly eat steak, chicken, salmon and halibut, rice, homemade pasta, quality cheese, organic fresh fruits and veggies, dry roast almonds, homemade ice cream and homemade cherry pie (a no sugar added recipe for the latter) and I drink about 2 cups of Twining's Green Tea every day. As I said about, I find I'm hungry for (and thus just comfortably eat) much less of these foods at eat sitting than ever before, and have been happy to do so. The supplement is expensive, but I have saved a ton of money taking dinner leftovers to work for lunch the next day.Assuming I continue to have curbed cravings and reduced appetite, and assuming my weight loss resumes soon, I really couldn't be happier. It's hard for me to imagine that this is just a fluke, after trying to budge my weight unsuccessfully for six years and then lose 20 pounds in 90 days. Will it all come back ifwhen I stop taking the supplement? Is the supplement safe to take long-term to keep my weight down, if the cravings return? As far as I can tell, nobody knows yet.If anybody cares, I'll be happy to post an update as time continues to pass. Today is May 25, 2014.
462. I really like this brand of contact lens cleaner. Works the best for me.
463. So, this is not regular powdered horsetail like you would normally buy.  This is 7%, so that means they add extra extract, which is going to make this stronger and extremely bitter. Since I eat my herbs like food, I don't want this extra extract added to it - the taste is overwhelming and bitter.  Plus, it's not green.  Good, fresh, dried horsetail powder is supposed to be green.  This is also from China.  I normally get my powdered horsetail grass from Starwest Herbs, and it's organic and from Croatia and tastes wonderful and fresh.  This stuff...tastes gross, wrong color, not organic and from China.  I bought this because it was cheaper than the Starwest, so I thought I'd give it a try.  But totally not worth it - you get what you pay for.  I'm going back to the more expensive horsetail from Starwest which is exactly the way horsetail is supposed to look and taste.  I like BulkSupplements normally - for supplements and amino acids, vitamins, minerals and chemical-type stuff.  I highly recommend Bulk Supplements for vitamins and supplements their quality is good and the price is excellent.  For herbs, I would recommend Starwest or Frontier - definitely not BulkSupplements.
464. Works well!
465. this is my 3-4th order, I am using it for my cats with renal issues, so far it seems to really be helpful, I just add it to the daily drinking water and all drink from it.  so the do not mind any taste if there is  one.  it dissolves easily in water.
466. Bought these due to the coating, hoping they would help in the lower gut. Did nothing, if fact sometimes they pass right through whole & undigested 12 hours later..
467. Purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder.  It IS less messy than regular powder, however, it doesn't work as well.  And it is oddly... greasy?  He reports that it is lotiony in a weird way.  Since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry.  If it's lotiony or greasy, not so much.If you're hoping for a replacement for powder - this isn't it - at least in my husband's opinion.
468. So glad to have found this supplement in a large quantity at a low price! It is the exact same supplement I was getting at my drug store at a much higher price!
469. I have one heaping teaspoon a day and it's like eating 3 lbs of carrots.  Could you eat 3 lbs of carrot a day...? I know I can't.A great product!
470. Since I plugged this in a week ago, and my litter box cleaning days have not changed, I am having no odor at all  - revealing the existence of a cat in my house.  It makes almost no noise and the only indication that it is on is a soft blue light and a slight breeze.  I can’t attest to it creating a germless environment - how do you test that -  but just for the odor management, this is worth the price.  We are in the midst of allergy season, and I haven’t experienced  any lessening of symptoms, so it may not be much help with allergies.  If you have a cat or dog though, this is a winner!
471. Super big bottles and ample amount for the price.  I was already familiar with this brand and have trusted it.  Easy to swallow.  No fishy aftertaste or "burps".  Really, no complaints or regrets.
472. These were great for my birthday, I definitely would recommend it for anyone looking for decorations!
473. These hemostats are VERY hard to open and close, almost impossible to do with one hand. I've used many different pairs of hemostats over the years and these are really just terrible.
474. So far my husband loves this dental plaque remover. This is not going to take the place of your dental hygienist, but it will help maintain in between. My husband has crooked teeth so this helps.The instructions are pretty much non-existent, so that is huge minus when it comes to this product. You would basically have to figure it all out on your own.Overall the product seems to work, but time will tell. Just need to have better instructionsNOTE: Take off the flimsy rubber tips first.
475. Not good nail cutters.
476. Men's Potty Portable Pee Bottle, Portable Urinals for Men, Reusable Male Pee Bottle Camping Toilet Thicken Men's Potty . Nice to have in an emergency. I am putting this in my emergency kit to save for an emergency.  OZ
477. Love it!! It works!!! No bug bites or sunburns plus no Icky bug spray smell. I use it on my 8 month old, and no rash or reactions.
478. Works well and price is good
479. I had to return this item as the handle was stuck and would not come out of the case.  It was totally stuck and would not budge.  I wrote to Frank Shaving Company in China and they were not helpful. I bought another WSP Monarch Silver Tip Badger to replace the returned item.
480. Not bad better then my car seat
481. Some people only refer to facial tissue with one word. Don't be like those people.Pros: - Softer than the eponym - Better Boxes than the eponymCons: - Why are you reading this, add them to your subscriptions - Seriously stop - I'm leaving this review while my wife watches some singing show. I wonder who is under this Rhino mask?
482. Product was received on time and in great condition. I’m a satisfied customer. MLS
483. Thank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.My mother and I suffer from chronic pain – knees, back, shoulder.Part of pain management is heat therapy. In some cases – moist heat.It is difficult to get a “moist” heating pad. And, it’s also difficult to get it to contour or FIT the difficult areas – knees, shoulder … ankle. Either you’re awkwardly sitting, laying, or balancing something.I’d been seeing and hearing about these “microwave” packs and took a chance on it.This was a dual pack so that meant one for my almost 70 year old mom (who lives with me) and one for me.First thing that struck me when I got the package – WHAT THE HECK DID I ORDER? It was HEAVY. I almost worried that perhaps I’d gotten something I couldn’t use.I took one, and gave one to my mother.She was the first to use it. She LOVED it! Only 120 seconds (2 minutes) in the microwave and it lasts for about 10 minutes. She can place it on her shoulder and it stays put. The moist heat does the trick in alleviating pain.A few days after she tried hers, my knee was in horrific pain. It was so bad I was dragging it around. So, I warmed mine up. And, as hers didn’t get that warm – I went three (3) minutes. I wrapped it around my knee with the Velcro, and …. WOW! It was HOT! I could barely tolerate it. So, this really gets hot. I’ve had regular heating pads on HIGH heat and barely felt it. This – I FELT IT!I didn’t have it on that long, but I can state – this gets warm! And, it stays warm.The Velcro closure is heavy duty and I felt like I might end up tearing the poor thing. The weight makes sure it stays in place.We love it and honestly, it might the last heating pad we ever get! Also – they’re HUGE!
484. I absolutely LOVE these prerolls. First off, they are made out of natural cotton cellulose, water, and glycerin - all natural ingredients - NOT plastic - and they smoke sooooo well!! I highly recommend purchasing ;)
485. I have been wanting to buy a Henry mask for a while. Finally, I bought one. It is so well-designed and fits my face nicely! They are breathable as described. Also, they are stylish. The straps are very comfortable and do not aggravate me. I will be buying more of these masks.
486. I hate vinegar(any).  I read it is good for so many things I thought I would give it a try.
487. Works good for my mother who is 91.
488. I bought this because I read that it helps with constipation issues. After taking this supplement for several days I found my constipation issue were much worse and I was bloating a lot. I would not recommend this supplement if your looking to alleviate constipation.
489. Seems to be legit.  I get a little nervous buying from 3rd parties due to possible knock offs.
490. My husband said he was not impressed by this flavor and it took a lot to get a hint of the orange. He did say he got a hit of orange creamsicle taste but it too a great deal of the product to get that hint. Also this product is not part of prime and the shipping cost was more then the price I paid so not a great bargain unless you were to buy many more flavors. This is not the first Capella flavor he has tried and while they indeed taste like the descriptions it takes a great deal more product to achieve then other brands. Now this is in reference to using it to make homemade vape juice and I'm sure if using for food purposes the flavor would be must stronger. All in all, it's just ok, and will not be ordering again.
491. Acai is great if you want to reduce your appetite. If you eat for pleasure then it might not work as well. I found that in two months of taking this supplement I didn't lose a great deal of weight (as reported in some reviews) but I did see dramatic results in the clarity and radiance of my skin. This supplement contains powerful antioxidants which protect the cells from free radicals. So if you are interested in skin health then I can recommend this to you. For me it hasn't helped me lose weight in a dramatic way as advertised in many blogs.~The Rebecca Review
492. These pads work great nice
493. This glasses strap stays on the glasses even with thin ear pieces.  I would order it again.
494. love this, its'  all natural, its lasts a very long time, have found a way to make this to save money
495. Works good my legs are so soft after I use this
496. Compact classy little pill case. Not much else to say. It’s so simple, but looks nice on my keychain with brown leather and other brass items.
497. Cute packaging and I like the scooper because it makes it really easy to fill my water bottles. This cherry flavor is really off. It has a weird aftertaste that's sort of plasticky.I drink caffeine powder mixes daily and this wasn't what I expected. It didn't smell weird to me like another person commented but the flavor isn't good at all.  The other flavors might be better.
498. Best stuff ever.  Can't be without.  Good for joints.  I feel and look hydrated. Highly recommended.
499. These socks are great. The fabric is soft, smooth, lovely. feels really nice next to my skin. I love how colorful & fun these compression socks are because all I've found up until now were just drab tan, black or white stockings that looked hideous. Just because I have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities (feet, calves) doesn't mean I want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose. These are so cute, bright & colorful. The only downside is that I am wearing these due to leg swelling & when my calves are real swollen (which is often unfortunately), the design on some of these socks gets stretched out, making it so you lose the very thing that makes these so pretty. The design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost at times & not so colorful. This hasn't happened on all the one's I've purchased (I have about 6 pairs). but definitely on some of them. If you're very thin or don't experience much swelling this probably won't be a problem at all. A solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes. Maybe just small & large.
500. I like these Pacific gloves, there nicer then other gloves I have bought before.The gloves are very comfortable, not the heavy thick ones  that I have bought at the grocery store before, thatHave always been too big, clumsy,  and uncomfortable, and I usually would only use about 3 times and forget about them.These are a size medium, fit me, but the small would have been better, I have long thin fingers.The inside is soft and actually feels good.I use these Pacific gloves for doing the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, and washing my heavy cast iron pans.These gloves Get a good grip on heavy cookware.I also like the sleeves  are long, and the water does not run inside, and I use them for gardening.Good price for two utility gloves.
501. Not for me. Stomach upset.
502. I love this dry brush!  I’ve never heard of dry brushing before but I’m glad I did!  The dry brush is very invigorating.  I used it on the backs of my arms and legs and my back in circular motions. (I wish now I had bought the handle, my husband helped me) It felt so good and left my skin with a rosy glow.  After showering I felt the circulation much improved in all the areas I brushed.  First day it just felt good. The second time I used it I noticed my skin tightening a bit and the skin on my arms felt softer, Even my lotion seemed to absorb better.  I’m very satisfied with the construction of the brush also.  It’s well worth what I paid.  The strap is secure and it has a groove in the back to attach a handle, which I’m purchasing right away!
503. These are surprisingly thicker than I imagined but still allowed me enough maneuverability to get dishes and household cleaning done. My hands are on the smaller side so this is always an ongoing issue. For being as sturdy as they are, I like that I could still use them. These gloves provide a great alternative to anyone with latex issues. Only used these for a week or so but there are no signs of wear on them as yet.
504. This flavor is scrumptious, very soft and creamy, almost feels like a full calorie, full sugar dessert, but without all the carbs and sugars. Very satisfying to me. just remember to warm them in a micro for just a few seconds that's the big catch so don't plan on using them for on the go unless you leave them someplace warm where they will stay soft.
505. Great pads and they wash up nice... Only issue is that since the cleaning agents are in the disposable pads from irobot you get just plain water unless you spray your floors with cleaner.. I used the wet mop pads to get the sticky dirty stuff and then used a disposable to get the floors clean by running the mop again.
506. These detergent packs have a REALLY awful odor when you open the container.  I didn't want them to be "scented" and they aren't but they have an off-putting odor for sure.  They do not make the dishes or the air smell bad, thankfully.  They also work very well and do not leave any residue on the dishes.  4 stars for that smell...bleh
507. Great product, only issue is getting it on the walker so it's stable and also I suggest having a two sided rubber trivit (like a jar opener) to reduce anything sliding on the tray when you walk.
508. I have been using this for grilling and salads and it tastes great. I am not too crazy about the plastic bottle though, so I used it to top off a glass bottle that I had previously used and will continue to add to that one. It has a very smooth taste and many, many uses!
509. This massager is ok - I can recline in my zero-gravity chair and it's pretty nice behind my low back, holds up to my weight but I can tell it's starting to struggle a little as opposed to another brand I have that doesn't give in at all. I also wouldn't advertise it as a neck massager - it's too wide for the neck. Scrapes the outline of the traps but that's about it, not bad on upper back. It's a one-trick pony but that's what these little massage pillows are. It's a 3.5 - pretty good, not great, and compared to another one I've reviewed, slightly underwhelming enough to not give it a 4.
510. Works as intended
511.  This is an attractive and giftable set of six bath bombs. The Amazon site says the four fragrances are Lavender, Vanilla, Rose, and Orange but it was hard for me to detect those aromas. They all smell nice  but the fragrance difference is super subtle. They are made with essential oils.I tried the greenishbluishyellow bomb in my foot bath. I used hot to tepid water and suds were created in the foot bath and the bomb fizzed as shown in the video. It eventually (in about 10 minutes) dissolved in the water as I bathed my feet. My feet felt clean and I liked the subtle scent. My feet also came out feeling  soft. Unfortunately, there was a slight adherence of the green color of the bomb to my ankles and heels but it was ever so slight. A white bathtub might develop a slight ring of color around it from these bombs but I suspect it would immediately wash off. Insofar as "performance," these bombs are really good. Luckily I had a strainer in my sink because I had no idea there was a surprise miniature animal figurine in these. I had a little dinosaur in mine. Although no price is listed, I suspect these will be priced between $16.99 and 18.99.
512. I need dark to sleep.  These do the job, blocking light perfectly and comfortably.
513.  Cute nail trimmer. Gets the job done
514. They were all tangled up together in a baggy. They are awfully thin and of poor quality. Several of them broke after 2 or 3 uses. They were packaged in a sloppy manner.
515. I take it with meals (especially ones that are heavy in fat) and it helps with digestion... I used to get bloated and my motility (bowel movements) would be slow.. but taking this product along with my main meals gets ride of the bloating... also I feel a little more energy  in a sense that since I am not bloated all the time, I have an easier time to move around and be active...
516. I compared this with elderberry Emergen-C (EC).  The ingredients are similar as far as sugar 5g, Vit. D3 125% and 50mg elderberry.  This one has 25mg zinc(227%) compared with 10mg with EC; Vitamin C is low at 270mg, 1000mg EC. I like more VIt. C.  This one does have turmeric root extract 140mg which scores with me.  Salt is the 4th ingredient with 23% of daily sodium, 29% chloride.  That's a lot for me.  I definitely taste it.You absolutely need to mix this in 16ou of water.  It doesn't fizz.  Stir it.  Mild citrus taste.  Overall, not my cup of sport's drink or immunity drink.  I think if you're out sweating hard, like a lineman in a football game, or prefer more NaCl than this will work for you.  The ingredients and packaging otherwise look good.
517. You cannot curl lashes with this product, but the customer service is great, I returned without any problems
518. Nice large 21oz. bottle of a body lotion I have not heard of before!The scent is Cherry Almond. The first scent I smelled when using this is Cherry, which is not my favorite.I like Almond better, but the scent does not last long.This is not a greasy lotion. It goes into my skin ,my legs and hands have been very dry, and my other lotionsWhere not helping much.But this Mountain Falls seems to help to soften my hands, and the do look better in a short time.I'm not a fan of some of the ingredients in this,  so I was surprised my hands do not look so old After using this a fewtimes a day.Came nicely packaged and no leaks, but The trouble I had with this bottle was getting the pump to come up ,soI could use this..not deducting for that.
519. Not more than a glorified piece of velcro. Not what was expected.
520. This has really helped with the stye’s in my eyes. I had about 2 on the rim of my upper eye lid and one on the rim of my lower eye lid. And I had a couple of styes on my other eye too. I used to apply this oil 2-3 times a day with a Q Tip. After going through a couple of bottles I found they had all disappeared one after the other over a period of 1-2 months. No side effects nothing
521. I loved it! I just barely got it. It arrived pretty fast... it looks WAY better then I thought it would, feels and looks high end. It works waayyy better than some high ends eyelash curlers I have had & can be compared to other ones that I bought for a ridiculous price. I super recomend this one.. You get a great product for an amazing price.
522. I buy a LOT of turmeric powder either from Amazon or from my nearest multi-cultural food market.  I make what is called, "Golden Paste" out of turmeric, coconut oil, water and freshly ground black pepper.  It has helped me and my husband immensely with bone and joint health.  I'm 62 and play very competitive tennis, singles and doubles against opponents less than half my age and I often win.  I am a true believer in the miracle of Golden Paste as my previously super sore and creaky knees have been transformed into those of a 25 year old's - no kidding.  Please google "golden paste" and see how easy it is to make at home and give it a try.  When this ORGANIC turmeric came up on my list of items I could review it took less than a nano second to select it.  I think it's wonderful, it comes in 3 smaller bags instead of one big one and it seems to be among the best organic turmeric I've used.
523. These work great to wipe... if you can keep hold of them! They slide all around and they dry out pretty fast. I think if they were each maybe twice as big, it wouldn’t be so difficult to use these to remove nail polish. I have to stack 2 together to effectively remove the nail polish. But they ARE lint free, there no problem there!
524. while packaged attractively and according to the company website - all organic ingredients, it is not clear how much evidence there is for the long-term (or short term) effectiveness of the aromatherapy blends.  This particular blend is heavy on ginger but dissipates very quickly.  While no doubt the initial whiff provides a positive awakening energy, it doesnt linger long enough to be able to notice significant change in mood or any symptoms.  Unsure if at this price point, it provides significant advantage over using one's own blends in diffusers.
525. I was ready to throw my shoes in the garbage. This saved them after 2 applications!
526. Christmas hat that is cute and fits nicely
527. Bought this for my daughters law and she just loves it. She gets to practice at home away from her job. She was pleased so I am satisfied. The delivery was quick and the packaging who great.
528. These are so handy to have around, especially if you're really into health and beauty stuff. They are on the thin side when you open them up and remind me of gauze (just a little thicker and more absorbent), but I find they're very useful folded (as is in the container).I use these with my toner or just to blot my face after washing and before adding my serum. I also use them to wrap up open beauty products so that they don't get all dusty or damaged (ie. brushes); in that way, they're best opened up and wrapped around the item.This is a huge pack so if you just use 1-2 a day, like me, it's going to last a good amount of time. These are also good when doing mild chemical peels at home - for applying the peelserum to your face. Much like cotton ballsrounds, these are a must-have for any beauty enthusiast.A discounted sample was provided for evaluation and unbiased review.
529. For my condition, the Male Comfort fit  Advantage is Easy to use and easy to empty and clean in the morning.
530. I finally have to admit that I'm getting older and my feet hurt. When I wear boots in particular,  after a couple of hours in I have to take them off or sit down because the balls of my feet will burn and it's just uncomfortable.I have some knee damage and I broke my foot a few years ago so these days even more than before, I am aware of how uncomfortable feet affect my mood,  my posture and my balance.When you are not walking straight and even late  it can affect your hip and lower back as well . These insoles are an absolute godsend. In my pictures you'll see how much thicker they are near the balls of the feet than the ones you get at the store,  or even the custom ones I had made at a local store. Nothing beats these for comfort. The gel is thick and distributes evenly in such a way that I feel like I'm wearing my slippers all day. I live in South Texas, where boots are an absolute staple, in the summer or winter, and these insoles have made such a difference!You will have to cut them down to size just like with most insoles that you buy at the store,  and since they are thicker than any others I have ever bought, I do need to wear thinner socks. But since boots (western ones, in particular) tend to be a little roomier,  these insoles work perfectly with them.I don't know what negative ion technology is but I really don't need to know the details. All I need to know is that these will stay in my boots and I will replace them every six months as recommended because I've never been more comfortable in my boots! After wearing them the first day, my daughter borrowed them from me and put them in her shoes because she was planning on a long day at school and work. She too was amazed...at 23 years old she has discovered that gel insoles are not just for old ladies like her mom. :)I never thought I'd be sitting here riding along review about my feet come on my boots or insoles, but here I am raving about my latest discovery! I can definitely recommend this to anyone.
531. Was suppose to come with a case and it didn't and it doesn't work good at all.
532. Bright colors on black background on a good sized poster.  Colors pop!  Only complaint would be that I wish was more detailed.  The 6" x 4" book cover to accompany the poster has more detail, just harder to see.  For a beginner is perfect.
533. Great product!  I recently purchased and used Emmy's Best Pet Odor & Stain Eraser.  My dog was a naughty puppy and urinated in our family room and the odor was strong. After receiving the product, I carefully followed the instructions that came with it.  The results are astounding, it worked! There is no more odor, no more stain, and my dog does not show any interest in returning to the spot.  I will be a repeat customer.
534. This is great for when I get really wound up, tackling too many projects at once, when my body is tired but my brain won't shut down to sleep, and when I can't stay asleep for a good night's rest. I like that it is a natural source of melatonin (plain melatonin is synthesized because it occurs in such small amounts naturally). I take this amino acid with others to support my health. I trust Source Naturals; I haven't found any problems with their products on Consumer Lab's website. I've been taking L-Tryptophan for a couple years intermittently, and daily for the past three months.
535. I read the reviews and was scared it might break when installing so I called Drive Medical and a tech walked me through each step. Not only that but he took the model number and installed one with me while we were on the phone. That way he was able to give more detailed instructions when the upper washer seemed to not fit. Well it got installed in about 5 minutes with no tools and is perfect for me. There are more expensive models but this has all the features recommended by my occupational therapist. In fact, she installed it with me. She thought it important for me to have an onoff switch in the handle and the ability to divert water into the regular shower head as needed. It's the perfect length, color and very easy for me to handle. Plus, it came in 24 hours and I didn't pay extra!
536. I recommend this to everyone. This is a life saver!!!! If you have a baby or a child that has nose discharge or is congested I would definitely use this. It saves time and energy. It has different settings for suction and easy to clean.
537. Very happy.  Good quality,  packaging and product. Quick delivery.
538. For the money it’s really worth it plus more. I’ve not had any issues with it and I’ve had it for a year. It helps so much.
539. I followed the instructions and this product seemed to help my slow kitchen drain.  It has been about two weeks now since I finished using it and everything seems to be working well. I will get more and use it as maintenance to keep my drain clear. I really liked that it was so easy to use and each dose was in it's own bottle. So all I had to do was shake it and pour the liquid down the drain. No mixing or measuring.
540.  i’ve went through about 4 foot spa machines and this by far is the best and i will surely keep. it is big. enough space for my husband who is a size 11 and he says he still has a lot of room. second, i love the remote control AND drain. something i’ve not really considered and am glad i got this. honestly, i got this on a whim. thinking i’d just return it if I end up not liking it. did not read that it had a remote lol. as you see in the video it works so hooray! the drain is kinda slow BUT dont let that stop you. if spillage is your concern, this drains slowly and no spills. third, the heater works!! unlike some that only retain the heat, this one really heats up the water for you. I know because i put cold tap water and heated it to 40. fourth… i loooove the rollers at the bottom. this made filling up and then moving it near the couch so easy. NO carrying for me, less mess, less spillage. fifth, the cover and the tools that came with it. they are useful bonuses. if you are like me who like to keep things dust free, the cover is something that you will surely appreciate. and of course the tools.. at first i didnt use them but they helped to get the smaller areas of my husband’s feet. i dont know how to use all of them but im sure they will all play a role someday lol. overall, recommend. steep price BUT it isn’t your regular foot spa. it is worth it i promise!
541. Very comfortable to wear. They really are as comfortable as a pair of glasses, even with a shield attached.Unfortunately, there is such a gap on each side, I would not wear this without a mask underneath. These face shields would be useful if you are only expecting something to splatter right between your eyes, or in the exact middle of your face. Nowhere else.So these are fine, depending on the level of protection you're looking for.The shields attach with a pull-off tape that sticks to the eyeglass portion.
542. I like that it has a backlight for easy reading. It is also quite accurate.
543. These masks are soft and comfortable to wear, but I wear eyeglasses and these masks do nothing to prevent fogging when you are wearing the mask. Although the fabric is 2 ply, your breath freely passes through the fabric and causes instant eyeglass fogging whenever the temperatures are cool. Since I live in Minnesota, cold temperatures are a constant issue. Very disappointed. I expected more from this purchase
544. This toothbrush is just OK, rated 3 stars. The toothbrush base itself feels very lightweight and cheap. The heads are very hard to get on, and the bristles feel pretty cheap and soft. The toothbrush does have a few different types of "modes" of vibration patterns, but I'm not sure how that would benefit the user.
545. They could be a little thicker so they hold the loop better
546. This is great for my contacts!  I use it to rinse off the contact solution they stay in each night. And I love being able to get 3 cans at once.
547. Disappointed! And frustrated with myself for being fooled by great marketing. “Blueberry Bliss” is actually soy and different kinds of sugar in a bar. They taste just ok, and are NOT a healthy alternative to other sweets. Just another bar full of soy and other crap. Don’t waste your money! NOTHING “blissful” about this bar.I hope I’ve finally learned my lesson! Most bars are junk.
548. I have very dry skin, and this cream works wonders. Lasts 24 hours on my body but due to washing my hands so much, I have to re-apply several times a day. Well worth the price.
549. Doesn't always give accurate numbers
550. We are enjoying this as a thickening agent, from pudding to finger jello.
551. Bath wrap
552. Super comfortable. Makes traveling long distances in the vehicle much less painful for my hips and sacroiliac joints. I love it. My husband tried the cushion and enjoyed it so much that he wanted one. Now he loves his, too.
553. I love that they won’t able to slide off my glasses!!!
554.  This is a white noise sound machine with a total of 6 sounds. It "sits up" like an alarm clock. I love that it is battery operated. I charged it overnight. This comes with a USB cable (not the typical micro USB; perhaps type C), the unit itself, and an instruction pamphlet. Operation is simple as per my video. Press and hold the onoff button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off.  Rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, and bonfire. All but one sound is pure annoying noise.The timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes. Each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off, it means the timer is off.There is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on. The nightlight button is in the center top. There are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light.  The first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial. The second press turns on one side of dots, then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off. The next press keeps all the dots lit. This is what they call breathing lights.The volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volume.The current price of $16.19 ($26.99 minus 40%) would be extremely reasonable for this if I liked it but I do not. It has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights. I like the look of this and that it is battery operated. I also like the simple operation. However, the two most important features (nightlight and sound) are lackluster in my opinion.
555. These bars literally make you forget you're eating them for energy.  They taste more like a snack food, but they work wonders.  The variety pack is a great way to try new flavors too.
556. One pair actually went too far into my ear, was able to get it out with tweezer. The bigger set does not block out most noise.
557. This works like a dream. Simple, perfect curls. But there is a huge problem. It doesn't stay charged to curl your whole head. I got a little over halfway done and the battery died. It was only on for about 20 minutes. Who has time to stop and recharge halfway through styling?? So sad because it works great but the battery dying is unacceptable.
558. Gets the job done and the spray smells wonderful! Nice microfiber towel too!  You'll definitely want this product to keep your yoga mat clean!
559. Good for my yard waste.
560. Excellent bee pollen! Good to eat by the spoonful, if you can afford it. Very satisfying. If it was half the price I would add it to half my dishes!
561.  I bought this unit because I have a lot of shoulder and neck pain. This is my second TENS unit and it is definitely better than the first one I had. I am very nearsighted and 70 years old and I can easily read the screen on this one. I don't have to get out my magnifying glass to read the screen,  which is very important when you're uncomfortable  and trying to get some relief.It arrived packaged very well as you can see from the video I attached and even fits back into the box which is unusual! I will keep this unit and a few pads and the manual in the enclosed pouch and store it right by my recliner. That way I can keep the box in my closet and just have the tidy pouch sitting right by my chair where I need it. I usually use the pads for 30 minutes and find that my neck and shoulders are much improved. The pads stay sticky after many uses so this unit will be by my side for a long time! My sister tried it out  I was so impressed she pulled out her phone and ordered one right from the recliner! This saves me a lot of trips to the chiropractor and lot of co-pays.  It definitely pays for itself quickly. It was an excellent purchase.
562. The low pressure from this replacement renders  the machine useless.Update: within 3 months of purchasing, the bigger side button sticks, which most certainly renders the machine useless.
563. This doesnt smell as strong as some others but it is a large quantity of eucalyptus oil for the price
564. We live in Savannah Georgia. This is the only thing that keeps the bugs sand gnats away. It is little oily but it works.
565. great price, works as expected
566. The opening isn't as wide as expected.  I would look elsewhere if you are looking for a toenail cutter for thick nails.  I will have to keep looking.
567. Great product i thought the bottle was glass not plastic. But i love that its not easy to break and looks very expensive. Easy to swallow.
568. These don't work as well as I remember them working as a kid, but does the job. 12 even 14 tablet works just as well as a whole. Fun for the kids, but I won't order them again - not worth the price!
569. This was a test with something I am not real femilure with.  Not a product for me, but I have seen my mom use them before.
570. Used them when I had to stand for a long time.  Helps my feet a lot
571. The vitamin C in these gummies is ascorbic acid and scientific research says that's not really vitamin C.  I think the best ingredient in these gummies is the zinc.  Zinc is a good at helping the immune system to fight off cold viruses.  These gummies taste great and I could eat the entire bottle in one sitting if I didn't exercise control, but I'm not too keen on the vitamin C source.
572. Great product and reasonable price for the quality.
573. Love that this is compostable!  Gets way more junk out of my teeth than Glide Floss (TMI, I know!)
574. They might have more Omega-3s but it's really hard to see any actual effect vs other pills.  These aren't quite as big as some but not as small as others.
575. Perfect for icing my lower back when inflamed with arthritis!
576. very thin do not fit well
577. These panties are hands down the most comfortable undies I've owned, period. The sizing is perfect and they don't ride up or down, ever.  You can tell these are quality-made panties as the texture feels sturdy, yet they are incredibly soft to touch. I can tell they will last. Also, another great feature about these panties is that they don't show the panty line when you're wearing tight pants. For such comfortable wear, you will not look like you're wearing granny panties!I bought these for $39.90 (and it appears the price has gone down a bit - now $36.90), but I will definitely be purchasing another pair here in a couple of months.
578. What a fabulous foot-care product this is! The metallic turquoise coating of this handheld file device is visually attractive, and the ergonomic design gives it a shape that’s extremely easy to grip and comfortably hold. The bottom surface features a whole sea of circular nano-blades that painlessly file away rough and dry skin in an instant, and then the powdered skin particles immediately rinse away with ease! The foot scrubber arrives with a drawstring plastic pouch that’s great for storage between uses, and I would highly recommend this affordable product to all my friends and family. I’m so impressed with this one!
579. Bought this as a gift for a hockey playing 12 year old grandson.  Since we have the Blue Orange version, I know he will love playing it with teammates on their trips out of town.
580. So tasty and they help
581. Your job won't let you use smokeless tobacco on the job?  No worries, friend!  Get some of these Teaza pouches and they'll help get you through the day.  They taste good and (temporarily) satisfy cravings.
582. Let’s face it, unlike men, it can be difficult for a woman to go to the bathroom outside. We purchased some acreage and needed something that would be easy to use with our Luggable Loo. This product was convenient and did a pretty good job controlling waste smell.
583. These clippers are sold under various brand names but have one thing in common-they do the job. Regular clippers that are of the same design always used to scare me because for what ever reason they were too imprecise and often ended up cutting into the nail's quick and frankly made me avoid clipping my nails until they were past due. Eventually I gave up using clippers and just used the scissors in my Swiss Army knife which lead to imprecise cuts that needed filing to look acceptable but at least they didn't draw blood.  Thick solid build that made me realize just how cheaply regular clippers were stamped out. The cutting edges are precisely machined and in the 8 years I have owned them there is no perceived dulling of the cutting edges.  The product should last a life time  A lot of time I have just held them and admired how precisely they were built and how attractive the results were. I own both sizes(toenaillarge and fingernailsmall) and find the small size hard to to get a firm grip on,I would recommend caution about  the small size regardless of your finger size and opt for the large regardless for both toe and fingernails. The only thing approaching second rate is the brand name decal stuck in the indentation, the clippers themselves should have Green Bell stamped on back. They sold as Seki Edge but are the same Green Bell clippers.
584. Had difficulty finding in retail stores. Pleased to have found it online. Really good product and easy to use. No harsh chemical smell and easy to rinse off leaving no residue.
585.  Not worth it at all. It's as if I didn't use anything. Yes it was on taught and tight. No, as you can see it let water in and soaked the  gauze that was covering the stiches that I had to keep dry
586. Product as described. I have straight super Fine long hair, it takes a while to detangle, even with this brush.. I wouldn't say it's a miracle but it's better than yanking through with a traditional brush
587. I was very dissapointed.  For the last year all I have heard is that wraps and herbal gels are the best thing since sliced bread.  Well, I was not impressed.  I applied the Herbal Body Wrap Gel sold by Forever Young to my thighs and arms.  The amazon ad said to just apply the gel to targeted areas.  Well I did.  I did twice a day.  I did this for a week.  Nothing.I was using this as a jumpstart to my new yoga and new lifestyle.  I know nothing is a golden pill to a perfect body, but seriously I did expect something.Disclosure:  I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.  The above review is my opinion.
588. Great product.  I've ordered this product several times for my great uncle who brushes his teeth too hard.
589. I like Ked this bottle but after using it on my glasses it seems to quit working. So I thought it was a glass cleaner. Never said that. So I cleaned my glasses first and spray lasted about 3-4 hours. Nice convienant bottle
590. I love this
591. I love my hot heart massager. It's re-usable and remains ready to use until you flex the internal metal button. The solution inside then crystallizes, producing heat in the process. The heart remains flexible even after the crystals have formed, making it suitable for hot massage.
592. Fit true to size.great quality. Comfortable. Non fading. Good price.goid timing. BUT after wearing 4 times started to see holes in leg area disappointed.
593. This two-pack glove set is well made, comfortable and durable. The blue pair has a thin flocked lining that feels soft against my skin and the unlined gloves are very durable. I feared they may be too short to reach the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket, but they are plenty long and end about 3" below my elbow. The size medium was a perfect fit and even though they are thicker gloves they are still flexible and tactile. I recommend these!
594. There are 30 shiny gold boxes that are perfect for Christmas gifts, cookies, cupcakes, or other classy but lightweight gifts. They come in one piece and unfold easily into a reasonably-sized box. The bottom is interlocking and just unfolds easily into place. Each box should be able to fit about one to two pounds of cookies depending on the size of the cookie. I can even get an appropriately-sized tiny cake in this box. Overall, I think these are classy and well-made but they are thinner than I expected. Therefore, these are for lightweight items only. Also, I would recommend using tissue paper or foil on the bottom before using to carry treats to stabilize the box a bit. The current price of $17.99 is competitive as it comes to $.60 cents each box.
595. This summer, my pops ended up looking like Rudolph the red nose reindeer from the weightfriction of his glasses. Luckily, these were available & I got em for him. He's now back to his normal grouchy self, minus the red nose. :)
596. This shake tasted horrible. I tried mixing it with different things to mask the flavor, but it not help.
597. The stool is very easy to assemble. It rolls very easily over either floors or carpets. The cushion is comfy. I read some reviews complaining of its longevity. I hope mine holds up for a long time.
598. Convenient way to store & protect credit cards from fraud.  Easy push button opener.  Fits all my cards and slides easily into my pocket or purse.  Peace of mind.
599. Love 💘 this product.
600. I love Swanson products and this is a mainstay in our home for things like Poison Ivy prevention or treatment, certain pain, etc. ( do a search on Rhus Tox and what it is all for)
601. Wholly jump'in Judas does regular tissues after a couple of days of runny nose tear the space between your nose holes as raw as a bad fitting sneakers in a marathon? A couple days of sniffles is endurable but that raw skin under your nose lasts.These are the genuine best solution I've found. Do yourself a big favor with these.
602. Love this brand and their beautiful designsgood pricing. Great quality too. This is my third pair. :)
603. Wonderful or someone like me who uses them each morning, I have a box in every room in my house. couldn't  live without them on hand.
604. Well one size will fit most skinny people. I doubt thesewill accomodate plus sizes or curvy figures. That being said they are nicely made. The waist band is wide and textured. The insides are soft fleece while the exterior is smooth. They do stretch but not far. They are form fitting but comfortable. Instructions say to hand wash. Not in this lifetime. I laundered in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle. Turned out fine.
605. Blocks out all light but does not stop sounds completely.
606. We have been using Happy Bowls for the last couple of years and we wouldn't go camping without them.  These are the best invention since sliced cheese!
607. Hi,I purchased a large container of berry lemonade. I do like it. I only wish I know the source of color. It's blue. I'd prefer a more natural color.
608. I have been taking this liquid vitamin daily and at first the taste is not great at all. You eventually get used to the taste after a few days. I have already noticed an increase in my energy level since taking this!
609. I thought the smell was awful. My three kids tasted it and they all hated it. They usually love this kind of stuff. I give them lemon-flavored liquid fish oil, which they love, and it looks like we'll continue with that.Made with algae and it smells and tastes like it. The citrus flavor only seems to make it worse.
610. These are very soft and comfortable. I have wide hands and did not feel any restriction wearing them. I was able to keep them on all night. The gloves and Ancient Greek Remedy Oil helped my winter beaten, cooking, cleaning hands in one night. Better than any daytime hand cream, that really doesn’t fix the damaged skin.
611. Simple to use, easy to clean.  Unfortunately it uses a lot of water to create the vacuum, so that's a downside.  I could use siphoning as a means to change water in my tank but the distance to the sink from my tank is 30 feet, so it's a little difficult to make it happen easily, but could be in the future because of the water usage.
612. I love this soaker so much that I purchased more for family members!
613. I'm older and have some recurring pains - my right shoulder is the worst.  It is part of carpal tunnel syndrome from typing most of my life.  Some days my right shoulder feels like concrete has been poured in the joints, making my shoulder heavy and hard to move (plus painful).  I place a pad on the front, just above my armpit and then one pad on the back, usually around the outer edge of the shoulder blade.  I could attach two more pads, but usually two is enough.  I then choose a pattern, strength and time and let the TENS unit do the rest.  The electrical charge that passes aroundthrough the muscle mass in that area does help to ease the stiffness and pain.  I can't say how much this helps me - all I can say is that it DOES help and is a great way to relieve pain without using drugs.
614. Was great but some of the letters did not have a valve to put air in, so we could not blow up!!
615. Perfect weight and good quality!
616. I've had trouble making fermented vegetables w just sea salt so wanted to try a culture.  My veggies turned out great with this culture! Will be making more soon!
617. it's ok, but my hair dye was too thick - I couldn't use the bottle normally.kind of expensive.
618. It works great for scrubbing but the 360 swivel action has a mind of it's own.  It does not stay in a locked position.
619. Blended well into my smoothies. Not much taste difference with the other vegetables and things.
620. More of a dull gold vs bright gold
621. This Japanese style bench is a great addition to my bathroom, I love the ease of sitting under the shower and washing my legs and feet and not having to worry about balancing myself, Get one I think you will be very happy with this purchase.
622. I love this dental floss and I can't find it anywhere locally. I hope they haven't stopped making it already. This is the same kind my dentist's office gives me a sample of each time I go in for cleaning. It's the only floss that I can get comfortably in between my teeth.
623. All natural formula. Each "serving" contains 40 billion cfu (a serving is 2 capsules) - they promise a minimum potency of 20 billion could by the expiration date. Theres 60 capsules in the bottle. The probiotics strains listed (there are 4 of them) seem to be similar to others with names like bifidobacterium andclactobacillus, etc. The difference in this product being the "Macktrek bi-pass technology", which appears to refer to the specific blend and how it survives into your system. The capsules are easy to swallow gel caps and they're defined as "shelf stable", the bottle i got has an expiration date approximately 5 months from when I received them.
624. Our carafe was a nasty mess inside, but no more. This product is easy to use and extremely effective.
625. Used this to make my vanilla! LOVE THIS STUFF! Best vanilla ever! Would buy again!
626. I like this product. Works well.
627. As expected, but can't hang on the side of a wheelchair because it's too long and rubs against the wheel.
628. Product description was incorrect on size.  Was not even close on fitting!
629. Not sure why anyone would buy any others on here that do NOT have the correct ingredients. Spending money for no impact on whatever health issues you are having. This is really good and comes with instructions on how to brew it. It works!
630. These little cord locks make all the difference in mask fitting and comfort.  I use a tiny crochet hook to slip them on to the cord.  I make masks and people like this option on them.
631.  A very close personal friend of mine has recently lost a few of her furry kids that she has had for around 15 years. She has been really heart broken and it doesn't help that she has a few more kitties around the same age. She does cat rescue and even though she has several other kitties she takes it very hard when she loses 1 of her beloved pets.She doesn't have any children of her own so her animals are her babies. She also lost her beloved father a few years ago so she has had her share of sadness. So I have been thinking about making her a bracelet that would have  charms to do with cats and dogs and maybe something to do with her dad. Kind of like a remembrance bracelet.This wing charm is perfect to add to my remembrance bracelet.This is the  Flora Mcqueen Personalized Guardian Angel Wing Charm Birthstone Charms Mother Bracelet Charm FMC-2001by AnmaoPROS...---the wing means....gauadian angel---nickel free---stainless steel....so it won't rust---hole size is 4.8 mm to 5 mm---eco friendly---hypoallergenic---comes with a gift bag---fits pandora braceletsCONS...---absolutely noneI received this product to test  for free and I was only asked to give my honest opinion. I did not receive any type of compensation for doing so. All opinions are my own or that of my husband if he helped me to test it. If I have a change of mind after I have tested it longer I will come back and update my review whether good or bad.
632. The picture is not what I got. I got the short ones with the pointed end which are much poorer quality than the ones in the photo with the squared end.
633. I bought these for cleaning out little things around the house that you couldn’t get a cloth inside. They are very handy.
634. The product is awesome but the sellers sometimes cut the fabric into multiple pieces giving you a small cloth to use be careful.
635. I ordered the wrong size so I cannot tell you how well they work or don't work. I will have to wait to get a new grandbaby to find out. I will update when I can test them.
636. Well made, sturdy and easy to use. The doors open in the same direction making it easier to get out pills.  The boxes are the largest I’ve seen.  Only problem is that the pills can get stuck in groove between am and pm boxes, but each row can be lifted out easily to get the pills out of the groove.
637. Solid construction and efficient. This ear and nose trimmer does a nice job of trimming without any pulling or risk of injury. It's not terribly loud, either. Recommended.
638. got since we have cats. I liked that it only needed changed once a year and with just a light bulb. With the litter boxes I was hoping it would help with any smell. One of my cats also has asthma so hoped it would help her. Not sure it has really helped with any of that and have one in each room. I do not like that they added a coupon into each box and said for your purchases you would get this credit. Though it wasnt for each one and only for one yet put one in each box and didnt say for only one on them so didnt like the false advertising included. Wouldnt of bothered to enter all of them if it would of stated that.
639. Wasn't a very noticeable change
640. Hear these are just the best to use! Grabbed 3 packs
641. I believed this may help with leg cramps...not so sure.  I didn't notice any WOW effect.
642. Great deal. Good price and good quality. Will definitely purchase again.
643. More than likely if you are using this you are under the care of a doctor.  It is a fabulous dressing although admittedly expensive.  I wish mine lasted several days but a day is all I see to be able to get out of them before they need to be changed.It is GOOD that there is no adhesive border.  Wounds are typically irregular in shape and the entire area most be covered.  If you can not find one large enough you can use two together.  If there was an adhesive border it would then stick to the wound which would be harmful.  It is much easier to use your own adhesive which you know will not irritate your skin.  As my skin is easily irritated it is necessary I use an adhesive for fragile skin and many of the adhesive borders already in place end up damageing my skin
644. These makeup remover pads are nice because they have a white side and a black side. The black side is best for removing makeup and the white side is best for applying toner or whatever you use. I have other white ones that are totally stained with makeup even after being washed a dozen times. They are made of 70% bamboo and 30% cotton and come with a bag to wash. Make sure you tie that bag tight before machine washing or you will be spilling cotton pads everywhere. I did notice that the panda on the front of the packaging is the exact same logo as the WWF panda named “Chi Chi” and I’m sure that panda logo has a copyright.
645. Works well, does what is says and helps keep you feeling clean an dry.
646. I needed something to keep my medical stuff in at home.  This is holding 2 BP machines, O2 meter, glucometer in the outer pockets plus a few other things.  I like to be organized and have "like" things together.  I'm happy that all my medical equipment is together in one bag.
647. I love these, very clean eating and easy to transport because they do not melt in the heat. I carry one with me at all times.
648. If you need noise cancellation don't waste money in this. The silicone plugs... well. you can hear the same having them on or not, How it is even possible??? It doesn't matter the shapes, colors, nada. Having this things in the ear canal is like having earwax, BUT you can still hear with this ones inside.The waxy stuff... Almost the same as the regular foamy ones.I will keep trying to find some noise cancellation earplugs...
649. I have alot of black... Hate those little fuzz balls, and an a animal that sheds constantly I do love my dog lol,  I have used lint rollers also the little gagets that are battery operated takes forever and really doesnt do the trickThis is great for heavy material like hoodies, sweatshirts and leggings.  I wouldn't recommend on material that snags. Best lint and little fuzz removal. BUT THE TRICK for me hold the material taunt!!!
650.  I've tried laser treatment on my legs recently so I had to shave my legs with razor. Few days later new hairs showed up. They were not too long for waxing treatment that's why I've decided to try an epilator. Honestly, I was very skeptical because I couldn't believe that epilator can catch such small hairs. But it did! I will post before and after pictures so you can see how clear my leg was after using this epilator just for a few seconds! It removed my short hairs with the roots! I'm impressed! Definitely will be using it. It is lightweight so I will be taking it with me when traveling.
651. --Very clingy- truly grabs onto whatever it is being wrapped aroundonto; including itself. Be careful!--The material is thin. I have used other compostable cling wrap, and this is the thinnest I have used.--Comes with a slider cutter that you have to attach to box for use in cutting sheets of wrap.--A little tricky to dispense & cut.  Once I got a piece off the roll, I was able to effectively wrap some food. It was while it is still on the roll and trying to get some off that is slightly problematic for me. Perhaps with more use I will get the hand of it.-- If you can get a whole sheet off, then know that whatever you wrap, this will provide a good seal.I find that the compostable wrap is much more clingy than regular cling wraps, and for that I will likely continue with buying compostable cling wrap. This is about what I expected, and works pretty well. However,  I prefer this brand: https:www.amazon.comdpB08XVSWFZ2(more pricy though).3.5-4 stars
652. It's OK… it works alright, but it is NOT powerful at all ! That part of the description is deceiving.
653. These are very good shoe insert insoles. I have small narrow feet and I was able to place these inside my flats with no issue. I did have to cut the inserts to fit correctly in my shoes but other than that, they are very comfortable and keep my heels from hurting as they did before. They provide the perfect amount of cushion in my shoes without making them feel funny on my feet. It was very hard trying to shape with scissors so that it didn't hurt the area under my toes. But in the end, it worked out. Overall, great insoles and great size after adjustment cutting.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
654. Bought this more for the scent profile than the "germ fighter" aspect. I saw that it was fine for use around pets when used as directed, which is also why I was keen on getting it. I have 2 labs and 3 cats, so it is important that I use products that are not going to harm them. I like freshening up my carpet, so I figured I would give this a try.For pet owners:  Sprinkle on carpets, wait 15 minutes, vacuum. THEN keep pets off of carpet for an additional 30 minutes after that. I didnt realize that second part is needed until I read the directions. I failed to see that when I was looking at the product description. It is there. So just know to add in the additional time.It smells really good. Very fine particulates. Be sure to follow directions with pets. For added precaution, I am using this in  areas that are well ventilated and not in direct sleeping spots.
655. Time will tell on the effectiveness but as of now not much difference in how I feel.
656. I think that it helps my sleep and cools my body temperature down.
657. Seems to be helping so far
658. I only use this on my face,
659. I used to love these energy drinks and have used them for years, but I do not see myself repurchasing in the future. They recently changed the formula and the flavor.  I don't mind the flavor change, even though it is not as good as it used to be.  But the main difference is that these do not work the same for me as the original formula.  From what I can tell, they halved the amount of &#34;Spike formula&#34; in the ingredients and changed around the order of the &#34;other ingredients&#34;.  It doesn't really matter since whatever they did, it is not as effective now as it used to be, which is a shame.
660. So thick that it is unusable for me. Nothing like Muro 128
661. I purchased the lavender scented spray and am delighted with the results. I did a deep-clean on my mat by spraying it down and letting it sit for 2 minutes, then wiped it down with the microfiber cloth and let it sit dry overnight before re-rolling. The scent is pleasing and leaves the mat smelling fresh for a couple weeks. If you are sensitive to scents, I would purchase the unscented version. Easy to use and the ingredients are safe. This bottle will last you a long time, even with daily use.
662. I already have previous sport elite model and got one because of new tens added. It is a great function and I expect the best. Great service from the buyer, and good price. Thanks
663. I don’t know how anyone who gave this a positive review was able to insert them into the ear at all. The material is very flimsy and they collapse at the slightest amount of pressure. After 30 minutes Of fumbling I gave them to the flight attendant to put in the garbage. They’re worthless. Stick with the putty type which always stay in place and block all sound. The only reason I tried them was that they’re in a smaller case than what I currently use. CAVEAT EMPTOR!
664. Received items in crushed box, all tissue boxes inside crushed. Still usable, too much trouble to return. VERY DISAPPOINTED in packaging.
665. Theses pills work very well to help with my inflammation.I did have an issue when I opened the package, some got on my quartz countertop and it seemed like it was going to stain it, but since it was quartz I was able to remove it. Had the countertop been granite, it might have stained it!I have also noticed that my urine is more yellow after taking these than any other turmeric pills.Pills are easy to swallow without any after taste.
666. Sometimes these things are good sometimes there not. It's always hit or miss when ordering these rollers
667. This machine is a good foot spa but it is a bit small for my taste. I am a man and men tend to sit with their legs slightly apart. If that is the case with you this unit will become annoyingly small after using it for a while.
668. Very good quality scale
669. I completed the full bottle of pills and my conclusion is that this product did nothing. I consider myself a biohacker and I am in tune with how my body responds. Perhaps the effect is masked by all the other supplements and peptides I take. I tried to isolate the effect from my other supplements and energy drinks. I tried taking more than the recommended dose, taking it spread throughout the day, taking it in the evening, in addition to recommended three pills at once.If this supplement does anything, it is too subtle for me to notice. Some supplements and medications take time to build up before their effect becomes noticeable, but I did not notice anything from this at any time during the month. I was hoping this would work since the company seems well-intentioned with a belief that what they are selling works.This is clearly not a stimulant. Anything that is a stimulant is more immediately effective than this product.The clinical trials are meaningless if they used a placebo as a comparison. They should be comparing competing products, such as caffeine, Adderall, Ritalin, and Modafinil. All of these competing drugs are less expensive than this supplement, excluding the cost of the doctor's visit to get the prescription. The real challenge for supplements like these is how it stacks up against caffeine, or a Monster Energy Drink, not a sugar pill.People that are avoiding stimulants are not going to eat cocoons either. Products like this target the fringe of biohackers, who already take numerous other supplements and are not nutrient deficient in anything. The target audience is different from a clinical trial group.The main compound adding to the cost is the peptide. For brain-enhancing peptides, Semax and Cerebrolysin are established, proven, and scientifically validated peptides, and both work great in me and have noticeable effects. I am not sure what cocoon peptide is supposed to do and the Web site of the vendor does not mention how it works. What is the mechanism of action? The other peptides I mentioned increase BDNF levels and are less expensive than this product.I am a man in my 40s and I have tried a large number of supplements, nootropics, medications, and peptides to help increase productivity, focus, and mental performance.The money-back-guarantee helps for a product like this, but it seems like you will need to take a test at the start of the 30 days to activate the offer.
670. This slip resistant tray worked wonders while my boyfriend had knee surgery. Now my Dad uses it as a lap tray.
671. Great Samples From Great Companies - LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
672. I am very happy with the small size of these capsules. The extra fruit and veggies added into my day to day is fantastic. I was nervous they would be too big especially since these capsules always float and mess with my headability to swallow pills but they really are great.
673. works great, easy to set up. its perfect.
674. It worked really great and you can see the screen very clearly. That's what got me was the brightness and clarity of the LED screen. I also like that it has usb-C and it comes with a bag too. Nice.
675. The o-rings won't stay on my glasses which defeats the purpose of using them. Tossed them out.
676. Love the color and beads at the end. I use them to store my jewelry and the bags are durable.
677. This is a great supplement for lowering blood sugar and aiding digestion. You don't need to go to strange lengths to take it, it's not meant to taste like fruit. You don't need to hide it in smoothies or soup. Just add 14 tsp of this into a small cup of warm water 2 times a day and drink. It's not going to taste delicious, but it's really just like a slightly bitter tea. If you're used to herbal remedies, you won't be phased by this. If you're used to gummy vitamins, you probably won't like it.
678. These are VERY tasty!
679. I bought these to help make stacked cakes. these did the job well.
680. I put it on and have not taken it off love this.
681. FANTASTIC. Upscale. Great packaging. Great instructing. Well made silicon with 2! stoppers. One w elongated loop and one flat insert. Nice cover. Microwavable. And they stay warm. Best of all is the modest size. Perfect for so many applications. I bought 2 and prefer these to all others. Im going to give the plastic set to the pets for warmth. These surpass all other hot water bottles. And what a bargain price for the high end product.
682. https:smile.amazon.comdpB00M9LMZHOref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_9?th=1
683. What I dislike is that the balls have to be charged after every washing. There is no scent and it's good for sensitive skin. The freshness is there but only after the balls have been sanitized in direct sunlight. Also it really doesn't kill odors as strongly as I would have liked
684. I don’t know what it is but it seems like he is not real I don’t like it
685. Solimo Petroleum Jelly White Petrolatum Skin Protectant soothes and protects skin by creating a protective moisture barrier. Helps provide relief for dry skin and helps protect minor burns, wind burn and chapping
686. Item arrived exactly as described. This is a high-quality item that is definitely reusable for multiple occasions. I used this as a backdrop along with some other wall decorations.
687. I appreciate the price as well as the product and I continue to come back to it each time I run out.
688. This product did not work. Could not get it to turn on. Cheaply made.
689. I am in no way skilled at using a curling iron. With that said, after getting used to the longer barrel, it was surprisingly easy to get nicer looking waves and curls where I want them. My hair is naturally curly with a lot of body, but my natural curls are unruly. This has helped tamed my usual nightmare and I love the results. This iron is value priced and I hope it holds up well. Enjoying thus so far!
690. I have a couple of shoes that rub bunions — it works as advertised.  I have also used it to keep sticky zippers working.
691. I’m used to the crappy foam earplugs for everything, and these are my first earplugs of this kind. Wow! What a difference. This reduces the overall noise level to protect your hearing, yet you can still hear with enough definition to have a conversation with someone and understand what they are saying (assuming they’re speaking loudly of course). With the other kind, everything sounds muffled, so you can’t really do that. Added bonus: these are so comfortable. I’ve never worn earplugs as comfortable as these. There’s no pressure or ear ache at all! Best earplugs I’ve ever used. No wonder they have a special little carrying case.
692. I really like this brush for my dog. The handle is very comfortable to hold. I was using a toddler size toothbrush on my dog but this toothbrush is so much easier to hold and makes cleaning my dog's teeth a little bit easier.
693. This stuff is good; it makes my contacts feel more comfortable and certainly keeps them cleaner. But this stuff is so damned expensive! It probably cost pennies to make and they run up the price because they have market share. With the way you have to use the product you run out of it super quickly and realize you've just blown $15 on a few weeks worth of contact cleaner. Crazy!
694. Not as good as an alcohol based cleaner. 420 cleaner better 10x
695. Will not stay in place on back on chair!
696. Excellent product. Just what I needed. Petroleum Jelly.
697. Works when in but not great as goes off tooQuickly.
698. Works really well.
699. I used to have one of these mops when they first came out it was one of the as seen on TV versions this is the best mop hands down it literally picks up every micro dust of hair or debris that is on your floor. If you have pets or get a lot of dust in your area this is definitely the mop you want to have.
700. While installing this generally involves finding the right spot in your ducting (especially if you have a humidifier), cutting a hole, and wiring it up, it's easier said than done.  You likely will need a drill, Dremel, andor snips, and most folks don't mess with their ducting much (the video provided by the vendor is a bit misleading, as you generally cannot just drill through drywall to install!).  If you know someone who does, it'll likely be easy for them.  The brightness of the bulbs makes it hard to QC things, as you cannot easily tell they're on without being blinded by severely unhealthy light.  I actually had welders goggles handy, which helped a lot.  The unit does have indicators on the outside, but if you want to verify things while setting it all up, be careful.In the end, it all works.  It was easier to install than a whole home humidifier, but more difficult than many home improvement projects.
701. They are helping especially with cramps.in my feet.
702. Been diagnosed with GastritisColitis, and use for those issues. WOW! I'm impressed, every day I'm a little less severe. They had me on Famotidine for over a year and this did more for me than that in 1 week. Note: I take 5 pellets!
703. It's perfect. I love it,  it's sturdy and very good looking. I had bought a very inexpensive folding cane that was noisy...
704. I'm kind of between a 6 and a 6 12 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose.  These pads help with the 6 12 for the ones that are a little loose. Adds a bit more comfort for long wear.
705. I am pleased with this sensitive toothpaste. I have been using it for the past week and it has kept my sensitive teeth feeling good. It has a nice flavor. Not as minty as my previous sensitive toothpaste, but very pleasant and light. It foams nicely without being too foamy. I have not had any pain in my teeth since I began using it. I already used a sensitive toothpaste before this one, however, switching over has not caused me any problems. I like the consistency of the toothpaste. It is a normal toothpaste consistency and is not watery at all.
706. US Organic 100% Pure Frankincense Essential Oil - USDA Certified Organic - 10 ml is the way to go when choosing essential oils.  I appreciate the quality for the price, so many of my friends are very into the 'name brand' oils which I am sure have their benefits however I can't afford them and you only get the tiny little bottles. I was able to purchase this larger size bottle for more than half of what it would have cost to order thru their company.The amazing amount of health benefits that come with purchasing US Organic 100% Pure Frankincense Essential Oil - USDA Certified Organic are shocking, I have listed some of them below.1. Stress Relieving Bath-Soak2. Natural Household Cleaner3. Natural Hygiene Product4. Anti-Aging & Wrinkle Fighter5. Relieves Symptoms of Indigestion6. Scar, Wound, Stretch Mark or Acne Remedy7. Natural Cold or Flu Medicine8. Helps Relieve Inflammation and PainI was given a discount for  received this product for free under the conditions that I give my honest review.

707. These are awesome. My heavy wetter now sleeps through the night!
708. Fell apart within a week of using it.
709. Timely shipped. Like the boot compared to other expensive ones that turn on the foot in the night. I'm healing from an injury.
710. It is difficult to keep your teeth dry to put on the whitener.
711. velcro is very itchy and irritating for clients...buy the drawstring type sooo much better - JMT Beauty Soft Black French Terrycloth Spa Wrap w Drawstring & Stopper
712. This stuff is delicious! I don't know why every shake powder has to be Chocolate, Vanilla, or Berry... or those hyper-sweetened flavors, so this one is a great option if you just want a tasty shake that tastes like oatmeal (delicious). I wish the carbs were lower, but I mitigate that by using unsweetened  flax  soy  almond milk, or a green juice (spinach, lemon, apple, carrot) and it makes it very balanced.
713. Perfect product for what we needed them for! I scooped ice cream into each one, fed a straw and a spoon into the slot of each lid, and put them all in the freezer...at party time, we scooped ice into the tub I had them in, everyone could choose their own flavor soda to pour over the ice cream in their cup, and each person got to have an easy, no mess ice cream soda. It couldn't have worked better. Thanks!My only complaint is that the lids stuck together really badly and took me forever to separate some of them.
714. Mediocre. Sally’s has stronger files will stick to those
715. I am using this powder on my dog.  It's a great product.  It helped heal his wound.  But my vet warned me about using it on him, if he licks an area.  The zinc in the product is toxic to dogs.  So I stopped using it because he is always licking on the wounded area.
716. Lots of dental floss so I won't have to order it again in the near future. Also Prime free two day shipping to my front door, what more could you ask for? The floss is fairly thin which I wanted so I could floss in between a  couple really tight teeth I have. The flavor is subtle mint and at 55 yards one container has plenty of floss to last two months. By those calculations this order should cover one person for an entire year of daily flossing using just under 3 feet of floss each time.
717. This is an easy way to get the B-12 taken, but be very sure you realize that it contains FIFTY THOUSAND PERCENT of the daily suggested need. This could cause a problem.
718. I'm pregnant and have an indoor cat. Her litter tray is in our small bathroom. I needed something to aid in cleaning bacteria in the air. After 2 days using this device, it appears to be working well in our bathroom over the kitty litter. Within 6+ hours you could tell it has cleaned the stale air (scooping the poop out of the kitty litter as quickly as possible, and flushing it is advisable). I like the devise, but will also continue to clean the bathroom with bleach as well.
719. I thought these might be heavy, and that the edges of the rings would be scratch, but neither is the case. It lis well-made and lays very lightly on my neck, nor does it pull down. Hanging, it places my glasses mi-breastbone which is remarkably comfortable for me. I also bought the hearts but haven't worn those yet.
720. I liove this oil! I use it daily on my face. I mix my favorite essential oils in with it. It absorbs quickly and leaves my face so soft. I use a combo of this and pomegranate seed oil. No more expensive day or night creams for me.....and I've gotten compliments on how nice my skin looks,
721. it is an easy way to ingest superfood and I use this with my smoothie - i kinda throw in a lot of super food related powder in my smoothies.  with regards with this product - it does not have a strong over riding flavor , which is great as I prefer to taste the fruitsvegetables.  this is a great supplement if you are working out a lot as it is hard to replace nutrients lost from ordinary food without adding a lot of calories.love that it is fresh and sealed well to keep the product fresh.  I would buy this product again.
722. I LOVE Vital Proteins, so when I saw that they came out with a Collagen Whey I had to have it. I ordered the Banana, Cinnamon and Vanilla flavor and I was so excited to try it right away when it arrived. The taste and the texture of this new product is almost unbearable. I used the suggested serving size with the appropriate amount of liquid and it tastes so watered down and gritty. I have to take it in several shots to finish it. In the future, I will stick to the original non-flavored collegen protein. It was worth a try, but definitely not what I expected.
723. Why not eat the super fruit itself
724. Really like the double compartments.  I wish it wasn't quite as deep as I cut tiny oblong pills and it's hard to get it situated in the groove with that depth.
725. Cats in the microwave,  cats in the fridge. Got this as a joke because it turns out my real cat is terrified of a hot water bottle. Jokingly got this as a "maybe if he thinks its another cat" it will be ok. Turned out to be non scary to real cats and the cutest hot water bottle imaginable.
726. I have VERY sensitive skin and a lot of things irritate it so I’m always worried when I try something new. I spot test and wait, spot test and wait. This product doesn’t irritate my skin! First winning feature. It’s a milky toner which made me wonder but it’s moisturizing and balancing. It feels nice, allows me to skip additional moisturizing (normal combination skin) and leaves my skin clear and bright. Love this product and will buy more when this bottle is used up. Absolutely NO irritation.
727. I have worn these for years, and am finally taking the time to write a review. My podiatrist recommended them as a first step in treating a nasty case of plantar fasciitis that I acquired from running around barefoot for a production. I also work as a nurse, and am on my feet for 12 hours, walking an average of 10,000 steps or more at work. These were a miracle. It took time for the plantar fasciitis to heal, but these accelerated that process. If I wear shoes without them, or run around the house too long barefoot, it tries to flare again. If I behave myself and wear these in my shoes, I am completely pain free.  I've learned my lesson the hard way:-)
728. The nipple suckers do not work well at all, the syringe is not strong or long enough to get the suction needed for those with truly inverted nipples.The nipple correctors work but the surface area is way too large and definitely intended for someone with big nipples. If your nipples are smaller it’ll hurt a lot more than necessary.I’d only recommend the nipple correctors and only for those with large nipples. I’d say honestly to look for another brand myself I wasn’t too impressed.
729. Got these for my Sister who relies on those cheapo dollar store things, and you'd have thought I sent her a bad of gold, her reaction was so great on these.  She says they are super well built and optically obviously superior over what she's been using - and has had a couple of compliments on the way they look too.
730. Purchased for my grandkids and they they elderberry syrup year round. They stay pretty healthy too.
731. Great. Extra grainy. Will file thick nails. No need for extra pressure on thin nails, or even thick. Very durable files.
732. Did absolutely nothing for me.  Wouldn't stay on my foot.  Returned.
733. I consulted with my internist and endocrinologist before I started taking this. I was very happy that they thought adding this supplement to my daily regimen would be greatly beneficial to my health. This supplement is a well balanced mix of essential vitamins and minerals that helps with the quality of my health and immune system. I am in my mid thirties and I am noticing that the overall quality of my health and well being is just not the same anymore. To make things worse, I have several health conditions that I have been suffering from, for years now. I started taking this supplement together with other natural vitamins that complement its benefits. It is made from superior ingredients and in my opinion, it is well priced. Two thumbs up for this brand!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experiences with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customerend user’s standpoint.
734. If you buy empty capsules, you can make your own capsules to swallow and save yourself the bitterness of this powder. I do not plan on purchasing capsules, so I will mix with my Manuka honey and water and drink it down. This is supposed to be great and I am going to believe in that as I drink each glass.
735. Have not used that much and went to use it today and it gave an error which I think is associated with the band not inflating.
736. 3 stars for whitening  I only used it twice and not sure yet..it does however have a very minty sent . Love that it comes with 2 me and my husband are giving it  a try. Update a month later I have not used it continuously so I cant say but even just the 1 time using it it works decent I have to say I was pretty suprised.
737. I bought this as an xmas gift for my girlfriend.  She loves it.  It's tracking her, her young son and myself now and we have it tied into each of our Fitbit accounts.  I also tricked my mother and sister into buying one for each other for xmas.  Hopefully this will inspire them to take charge of their fitness moving forward.
738. I use baby oil mainly to remove eye make up. It is less expensive & does a better job than the make up wipes I've tried. This also works well as a body moisturizer when applied after bathing. Will definitely buy again.
739. works well great price. i am a nurse practitioner and this is easy to use and accurate. i recommend for anyone who needs to monitor their BP
740. Amazing absorption, yet very gentle on painful wounds.
741. Love these. Pads help with pain on knees and hips.
742. It works fine when your banana fits. But beware that the ribs do not allow it to flex more than a few degrees (contrary to what I assumed from the photos), so if your banana's curvature doesn't fit the narrow limits of the molded shape, you are out of luck. Also, really long bananas will not fit.One thing that is not apparent from the photo is that both ends are open, which is a good thing for airflow, and to let the stem stick out, saving internal space.
743. I thought these caps would be a soft silicone that would stretch to fit over the heel but they're hard plastic and were WAY too big for my stiletto on my wedding day. My bridesmaids had to wrap my heels in toilet paper to wedge these caps onto the shoe! They might fit a thicker pump style heel but they are far from a universal fit.
744. I've always made it a point to clean my dogs teeth since it's good for them and dental cleanings are very expensive. I've used dog toothbrushes and finger cloth brushes before but never a dual silicone finger setup like this. I never cleaned the inside of the teeth but only the outer sides. The dual finger brush does make it easier to clean the inside teeth and fortunately my dog is use to me having my fingers in her mouth. I'm sure this might not work for many but it does work okay for me and my situation.
745. Been on this one week, I think I need to be on it longer to see results, but I dont feel as tired.  Im taking this as a result of Dr. recommendation.
746. These Generic Oral B Compatible Toothbrush Replacement Heads - 4 Brushes are good replacement toothbrush heads for the Oral-B battery operated toothbrush.  I like them.  Good price.
747. this product may be good for you but boy is it GROSS. I usually have to mix it with some sort of juice to try and dilute it.
748. Works in a pinch
749. Wonderful way to store multiple brushes.  I wonder if they have a stand like this for DESE razors?
750. We like that it came with a glove to protect your hand from getting burned.  It does warm up fairly quick.My daughter has long, thick hair, which made it time consuming to use this because we were worried about burning her hair if we kept it on one spot too long.  You have to use it in very small sections of thin layers.  The swivel cord made it easy to just angle and brush where she needed it.Overall, it works.
751. They are a ok replacement in a pinch
752. Had this for almost a month and is holding up great, its stays put, and has little ridges that help you not slip. Would be great for someone who is elderly for that reason, and it looks very spa-like as well!
753. so I started using this Benecol today.  I will post update on my numbers in a few weeks.BTW:  GREAT packing.  Arrived well packed in a small cooler with cold packs, despite the temperature outside being in the 50s.  Appreciate the thoughtful packing.
754. Did not work for me and would make my heart race out of nowhere. That's unusual because I've taken many diet pills in the past, including ephedra, and never had that problem. Once I discontinued use my heart stopped racing.
755. I really liked this whole set. I was out of helium, so that was no fun. I was only able to use a few of the balloons. I couldn’t get enough helium in the confetti filled balloons to get it to float! It sank, so it was just sitting on the table. All in all, the banner itself was totally worth it. It was easy to thread the letters on to the string with the “needle” tool.
756. I think these detergent sheets would be great for kids living in dorms at school, or when you are taking lengthy trips somewhere. But for home use I'd rather have my big jug of liquid laundry detergent.  I've used several of these and they seem to clean clothes just fine and don't leave any perfume scent behind on them.  However, I have to use 3 sheets at a time since my laundry loads are big.  At that rate, I only get about 10 or 11 loads done and that just isn't all the economical since one box costs $10.59.  I can get a big jug of liquid for about that much money.  All that said, these clean fine, are easy to carry (especially good for those who can't carry much stuff) and don't leave a perfume scent behind.  These would be great for those with a very limited storage space in their laundry area.
757. didn't bring back the black and remove scuff marks as well as I expected
758. Quite an advantage when sitting for a prolonged period on hard surfaces.. Not really &#34;soft&#34; but adds a lot of comfort as your weight seems more distributed and hence the &#34;No-Pressure&#34;.  It is very portable and works on many surfaces. My wife sits on it when on a soft sofa and has significantly less lumbar pain. . I have been using 2 different types of the horse-shoe shaped chair cushions (with the sacral cutouts) for about 1 year  and find these to be amazing when sitting for long periods on a wooden chair.. but they are more rigid and do not quite distribute pressure like the purple... To be honest... I put the purple pad on the chair.... then the anatomically shaped butt cushion and together they are the ideal solution. Most comfortable sitting arrangement I have found ever.
759. Setup was a bit challenging but once I got past that I have loved this scale.  It syncs without fail (more reliably than my Fitbit tracker) and has held up fine despite occasionally being knocked over.  It has traveled 1200 miles in the trunk of my car when I wanted to take it on a month-long trip and is still no worse for wear.  I'm not sure if the body fat percentage is accurate, but the weight seems to be.  Another bonus is that this automatically updates on My Fitness Pal once it syncs!
760. Oh. My. On all things holy, GET THESEThese are AMAZING! I took a big whiff of the bag and it allowed me to breath better already... but once you put it in your shower 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 I swear it’s like Baby Jesus himself came to rid me of my allergies 🤧 I can breathe y’all!!! I can really breathe!
761. Tangles after a while.
762. I consume this cod liver for the vitamins A and D, and the omega-3. This batch wasn't as smelly as the first (or I'm getting used to the fishy smell!). I still season the liver with a bit of lemon juice or vinegar to kill the smell even more. Bottom line: nutritious seafood without the bones!
763. Very fast delivery!Strong and durable. At 4 mils not too thin and not too thick. I am using these to organize my many jewelry beads and stones, most of which are still in the mailers. I expect to reduce my storage needs significantly.
764. Good Product Fast Delivery
765. I have tried a few similar silicone face mask brackets and I feel that these really are the best! What makes them stand apart from the rest is the silicone strap. Basically, you are wearing 2 separate things - the bracket and your mask. After nearly a year of wearing masks, I have found these to be the most helpful when it comes to preventing my glasses to fog up. The silicone is very soft and non-irritating. The storage cases are an added bonus in my opinion. Love these!
766. Works OK. Maybe not as well as a cyptic pencil but also doesn't leave a black mark.
767. Meh. It does the job ok, but you have to clean it after every swipe and it gets tedious
768. i HAVE USED THIS BRAND AND LIKED IT FOR A LONG TIME.  THIS PURCHASE IS BECAUSE i CAN NOT GET THE LARGE QUANITY REFILLS A LOCAL STORES.
769. This toothpaste has an interest flavor. Never had a lemon mint toothpaste, and it's not bad! It will probably grow on me more too. One of the main reasons why I got this toothpaste was because the ingredients seemed better than conventional toothpaste. Although I didnt realize it contained silica (never heard of it before either) so I looked put up to see what it was. I guess it is ok to use, but I also read it could wear down your enamel. So I dont think I'm going to be using this regularly (just in case) I may use it weekly or even biweekly. The toothpaste doesnt foam up much, which some people may not like. Besides the silica concern, I like the toothpaste. Makes my teeth feel clean.
770. Very comfortable and has made my longer driving trips( longer than 45 minutes) much more tolerable!! Arrived quickly! This device really works!
771. I hats flouride. I go well out of my way to find flouride free products. This is the best one so far. It whitens like a lot of the other tooth pasted can't.  It is travel size but a little goes a long way.
772. This is colorful and lightweight. Keeps the sun off of my face...I used some iron on hem tape to make it a bit smaller.
773. My wife loves this.
774. Full disclosure: yes, I'm a very tall and heavy guy, so this review may not apply to a lot of people.  On the other hand, I'm within the advertised rating for weight for this stool, and my disability makes it a necessity to get around in my kitchen.I had high hopes for this product.  The same feature (thick seat padding) that makes this uncomfortable for me after prolonged use is also what makes it durable for my weight--so that's an even trade.  After all, it's a stool and not a recliner.  I'm good with that.What I'm not happy about is that, after just over two months of using for about 40 minutes a day, a wheel fell off this morning and wouldn't snap back in again.  Then I was surprised to see that the sockets for the wheels to snap into are just molded plastic!  One of the edges of that failed wheel socket had cracked.  What a poor design--going cheap like that instead of a few pennies to put metal inserts into the plastic.I've poured a bunch of thick "super glue" into the socket to see if that will work as a temporary fix until a new one can get here.  Yes, I'm taking a chance on another one of the same type, but I can't keep paying about $75 every two months to buy stools that I really need to have to lead a fairly normal life.
775. This scale generally works okay, but it seems to have a weird memory function. For example, I'll take my weight and it will jump around pretty dramatically before jumping to a number. Then, if I step on it again, it'll immediately go back to that same number, as if it has a memory function in it. Then, just to test it, I'll grab something else (about a pound or so) just to test it, and it'll STILL immediately jump to that same number. This obviously makes me not trust the numbers.
776. So far it is the best quality on the market for such affordable price! I have combination, acne-prone skin and this has been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine! I use it twice a day, once in the evening when I shower. Also make sure you use the sponge everyday and keep it kind of wet so it will not dry and will last much longer! I simply love it! It has really made a difference in helping clear up my skin and keep it clear. I love that it exfoliates without being harsh, and I love that the sponge itself lasts for so long! I've had mine for almost 2 weeks now, and I will probably replace in a month or so. I highly recommend giving this a try, it has really helped me!
777. Cute, but a bit misleading. Colors were on-point, size was not. Instructions were non-existing.
778. Super cute bags! I bought them for my med school friends graduation party and they were a hit! They didn't lookfeel cheap or tacky and were the perfect size to fit some candies, band-aids, and bone shaped pens.
779. Seem to have a little more energy. Feel a little better. Maintain weight through Christmas.
780. PERFECT FOR THE BARBER SHOP !!!!!!
781. I've used it for many years, but a few years ago it disappeared from the drug store & grocery shelves.  I don't know why, but Amazon continued to carry it.  This last shipment came from India. The cardboard boxes were all crushed, but the tubes were just fine.
782. Th scouring pads are basically the same pads I usually buy. I use them till they fall apart which takes about couple of months, and I wash dishes very often. New, these seem fine. Scrub well, leave dishes and surfaces clean. It works for me.
783.  This 5 piece eye make up took kit is actually pretty nice. The container it comes in is kind of just plain, would love to see a design on it, but the brushes work really well.I tried out each brush and none of the bristles fell out, they seem to be pretty durable., strong and made of good quality materialThese would make a great little gift to your wedding party girls. Give one set out to each of the girls in your wedding party. These would also be great for holiday present or birthday present. wrap a nice little bow on it. dress up the container with sequins. Overall, I would say this brush set is a good quality product for the priceI received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
784. After using the sponge for a couple weeks I can honestly say it's one of those things that I didn't know I needed it's really gentle on my skin and I love using it with my simple cleaner. I was a little thrown off by the way It arrives it waschard textured like a rock but after running it under water it became very soft and luxurious feeling
785. I got a very strange email following this order, makes me question product quality and security. As far price goes if ingredients are as stated 90 for the price is good.
786. Very cheap for a 3 pack, and the color is great but thats because of BabyLips
787. I tried several kinds, all homeopathic nasal spray for sinus.  This is probably second fav, works good but best one is “Seagate Olive Relief” for me.
788. Just what I needed for my bottles with squeez tops!Watch some of the videos where a lady has rearranged the slots to meet her needs! Way cool!I got the finished box but I almost wish I'd hotter it unfinished. I don't like the smell and I'm afraid that once my oils are in it, that smell will mix badly. Maybe I'll just set it out with the lid open for a week.
789. Unfortunately, this mostly just pushes dust around. Very little clings to the brush. I thought after washing it maybe it would be "activated" but still no. I should have returned this when I had the chance. Now I'm stuck with it.Would not recommend.
790. They don't have alot of peanut butter flavor but, they're tasty. Considering the carb count and the amount of protein, I definitely would buy them again, perhaps the lemon bar flavor. They have a good lemon taste.
791. This is a good selection of balloons for a graduation party. I loved the confetti filled ones! The numbers are huge, but one of the four numbers had a leak in it from the get-go. We taped it up, but it was never as full as the other ones.
792. Since a relative had a knee replacement, we’ve tried 2 brands of ice bags and 3 brands of cold packs to keep her swelling under control. She prefers this ice bag at night because it gets the coldest and conforms to her knee the best. Get the 11-inch bag for knees; you’ll need the extra width once the ice bag is full. The 3-inch wide opening on this bag enables you to include larger ice chunks instead of having to hammer ice into tiny chunks to get them to fit. Be sure to DRY the threads of the ice cap on the bag and cap before and after use. I had leaking from another brand of ice bag after shreds of ice got caught in the threads when I screwed the cap on. The leaking stopped with that bag, and I’ve never had leaking with this bag, when I kept everything dry.
793. Originally purchased for travelling. Easy to pack and takes up little space. Had some left and started using on a regular basis. Does a great job. Takes up far less space in my tiny laundry room than those big tubs of detergent. Never makes a mess.  What more can I ask for?
794. Ugly colors
795. I purchased wrong size but item was good.
796. This thing actually works!!! I was skeptical at first, but i am now a believer. Cool to the touch and you can set how hot you want it to be on your hair. Works on all hair types and so much easier than a flat iron. Straightens the hair without taking away its volume.
797. Due to extreme Lymphedema I need to almost constantly have my legs ankles and feet wrapped. But the ace bandages would bother my skin, especially since its dry and the warmer weather was coming and we had days that I was sweating so much. It was suggested to me to purchase these and we would use them as a barrier between my skin and the ace bandages,. Well it worked quite well. I would have the nurse or the aide depending on who’s day it was here to wrap as suggested and sure enough it not only stopped that feeling of sweating, but also the little breaks in skin i had got a chance to heal and by using lotion first and then sealing it in with the clean wraps it helped my skin to absorb and become softer, smoother and healthier. I highly recommend these.
798. I don't know why I keep selecting these weird powders when they appear on my list of items I can review.  I really can't tell if they have any positive or negative effects on me after consuming.  I assume they are healthy in some way so I dutifully add a spoonful or two to of them to my daily smoothies.  I can't even detect that the Astragalus powder is in my smoothie because it blends in smoothly with everything else and I can't taste it.  I guess if you are interested in Astragalus powder you already know why you want it.  I'll just tell you it tastes fine and mixes well.
799. We liked it was easy to scrape the plates off
800. I use zip lock all the time and I like these because they had Texans on them
801. Now sure what they’re talking about warmth.  I love this flosser.  It has different setting, I use soft which is still pretty strong.  The water pulsates through and you have to be careful with how wide your mouth is open or water gets everywhere.  Definitely makes me want to use it.  Only drawback is where the buttons are placed, I’ve accidentally turned it on a few times and water sprayed all over the place.  The water tank holds enough for two uses, but the charger lasts forever.
802. I got this Dr.Pedi Kinesiology Tape Bulk Muscle Tape for my wife and I - we have both been sidelined for several months. She severely broke her foot back in November 2020 and I hang a torn hamstring and then last month, surgery for another issue. I knew we’d be needing tape as we were allowed to get back into working out. Primarily I had wanted something for her - this foot break was so bad she was literally off it for 5 months - NO weight. And she loves working out, so I thought having tape would help give her support - and confidence - as she returns. She was finally cleared and has been very slow in building back up what she’s allowed to do. Today she finally was able to jump rope and put enough pressure on it to require the support. She’s very happy with the Dr.Pedi Kinesiology Tape Bulk Muscle Tape. First, there are three roles. Second, it comes in pre-cut lengths which were perfect for her. Today she had the whole piece - she used three full stripes at points around her foot. It proved excellent support and made her feel completely safe as she jumped - this is a major step forward for her after such a major break - 2 bones, one almost shattered. So that this Dr.Pedi Kinesiology Tape Bulk Muscle Tape kept her safe and secure is a good thing. Admittedly, she literally is only just back - and I’m still another week from being cleared - but I am so happy she felt safe while she was out there. She did not cut it down - there are the lines so she could have - but the recommendation was keep full pieces for what she needs. The corners are pre-rounded so we are hoping it keeps the corners from peeling too quickly. Again, this was her first time, but so far we are very happy with the outcome.
803. Good for Four or Five Cigars or 2 with a lighter
804. I have long, thick hair having said that these things are worthless! They are hard, stiff plastic, have no give to them. I tried using them several times and couldn't get them to work at all! Waste of money!!
805. I went to Vegas a week ago and was told to carry an Amethyst for Luck.  This was told to me by one of those fortune telling machines that spits out a card.  The amazing thing is, I am an Aquarius so amethyst is my lucky stone.  I ordered this stone not knowing what to expect.  When it came, I was stunned at the beauty of the packaging and the positive energy flowing from the product.The stone is gorgeous and has so much positive auras flowing through it as I held it.  It is a big stone that fits perfectly into my palm. I love how it feels and how it makes me feel.  I have noticed that I am more calm and more in tuned with my intuition.  Whenever I am upset or feel out of balance, I hold the stone and everything is fine with the world again.  In addition to, I feel like it is my lucky stone.I am glad that I ordered two stones. One for myself and one for my sister who is also an Aquarius.What sets this stone apart is the vibrational energy.  I have ordered stones from e-bay before and none of them gave me as much positive vibes as these stones.  I am so happy to have finally found someone who is selling REAL stones with POSITIVE energy.By the way, I bought a lottery ticket and won the mega ball.  Although it wasn't the $207 Million dollar prize, it's a start :)  I believe the stone is just warming up with with luck!
806. My family loves this game! We always can squeeze in one or two games after dinner and before bed. My 8 and 5 year old boys think it is so fun! A great game that is entertaining for both kids and adults.
807. These meal are great , and filling
808. We regret only that it is cheaper (per bottle) to buy a pair than three. Sad marketing, but it is our fault for not looking more closely at the prices. Otherwise, the product is great. We purchase it regularly.
809. This is a good multivitamin containing known vitamins that boost your immune system:  it contains Vitamin C, Elderberry, Echinacea, Vitamin E and Turmeric. It's not known how multivitamins like this will prevent infection from coronaviruses, but taking these certainly can't hurt. I generally prefer gummy vitamins but these are easy to swallow. Recommended.
810. I am usually in ketosis.  But when I cheat, I cheat and fall out with sugars and breads.  I know, it’s the worst thing I could fall out with.At night, after a cheat day, I will wake up and have to jump out of bed to the worst calf cramps I have ever had.  This magnesium is the only thing that has taken care of this issue.So now the pain of cheating is only in the regular pain, like weight gain, guilt, the three days of fasting with gross glycogen hunger pangs.
811. Don't waste you time or money on other products! Very effective and pet friendly. I did the carpets under 2 King size beds and still have plenty left.  I'll be buying a second to keep &#34;on hand&#34;.
812. Seriously, a shoe horn!  What's so special about this?  First, not only can you not find these in any brick and mortar store, when I asked the sales people if they had a shoe horn, they looked at me like I had 3 heads!  Thankfully, I found this on Amazon and I must say, the is the most amazing shoe horn ever!  I have used shoe horns for years and my roommate said she wanted to get one, so I bought her this one.  But now I'm buying more for friends and family members because this is such a useful and well-made product!  The handle extends to the point where I don't even have to bend over at all (I'm 5'4") and the part you put your heel on is very comfortable and helps your feet slip into your shoes like "butta" (butter...LOL!)  Seriously, this is an amazing product!  Buy it!!!
813. Not really sure it this item really does anything. Might be more of a placebo thing. Its not quite either, you can hear it within 10 feet.
814. Great for toenails
815. I do have 3 sets of these (a black, a pink & a silver set), 2 sets I have had for years, decided I wanted to pick up a third set. They are great for travel. I have tubes of different colors for different color pallets, one color tube (maybe the pink set) for browns for a natural look, a different color tube (maybe the black set) for graysblack for a dramatic look. I use the third tube (example: the gray tube) for a small blush brush and maybe a smaller brow brush & eyelash comb. They they perform pretty darn well for travel brushes, I have been very happy with them. The brushes are protected by the tubes so no bend bristles upon arrival at my destination. Have not had any issues with shedding either, even from the 2 sets I have had for several years. Highly recommend
816. I cant believe the difference between this product and other Vitamin C supplements Ive been taking. I had issues with my gums and an infection. Nothing was working to help heal. After taking this Liposomal Vitamin C for over a week now the infection is gone! I am so thankful.
817. Just what I expected
818. Listen, lets be frank. It tastes yucky, yes, but appears to work. I am very bad at being consistent in taking something that I don't really like, but maca powder seems to balance the system, boost energy, and certainly keeps you "regular". As to the claims of heightened sexual appetite... not so sure. Perhaps one has to take it a while first. HINT: The easiest way for me to take something that reminds me of dirty chalk in my mouth is to mix it with a very hot sweetened vanilla based tea like pumpkin spice, vanilla bean, or even almond. Even a regular basic tea sweetened with a tiny splash of vanilla extract is better.
819. I have been taking magnesium capsules for a long time, and I wanted to try topical form magnesium. You can feel the relaxing effect just few minutes after it is apply.
820. This is kind of a “kit”. . . though it has an “odd” number of items included.12 – 3D Face Bracket50 – Extenders2 – Lanyards3D Face Bracket – Really small.  Might work best for kids.  Depends upon the size of your face.  They are Made in China and I can only assume they are made for smaller faces.  But it can also depends upon the type of mask you’re wearing if you’ll be able to use them.  They measure 4” across by 3.25” tall.Extenders – 5.5” long X .75” wide.  These are made of hard plastic.  You’ll find some of soft silicone. . . but these are hard plastic.Lanyards – Again. .  “Odd” that there are only two.  They measure 13.5” long.  For kids and smaller necks.  The latches on the end are plastic and quite challenging to open.When you add 50+12+2 = 64. . . and at the current price of sixteen bucks. . . That comes out to .25 cents per-piece, which is really not bad at all.  One of the more affordable such items I’ve seen.Made in China.
821.  At the current price of $33.24 ($34.99 minus 5%), this is super expensive for something that can only be used as a nightlight. I was unable to pair this to any Bluetooth device and I tried a couple. Also, the touch controls are quirky, the timer goes off by itself with any button change, the light comes on automatically sometimes, and the pausemove ahead button is for show only as it does nothing. There are buttons on the front of the unit and on the bottom. It is impossible to read the bottom buttons. This is nice as a nightlight only and is barely functional as a sound machine with only 5 sounds. This is definitely not worth the current price for such a quirky and partially working sound machine.
822. These bags are so extremely thin theyare a complete waste! Five bags completely shredded as I was trying to open one!
823. This KT tape is great, stays on pretty well even after a couple showers. I would definitely recommend, great value for the price!
824. WOrks like a charm.  Has the bottom of my feet feeling baby soft.  I have,  the funkiest, sweatiest feet ever seen in a woman.  I have tried the “As Seen on TV” products, and  slathering my feet in coconut oil and wearing socks, etc. to no avail.  But when I found this all the other went in the trash.  I have been using this product on my feet for a few weeks .  After use  I apply some foot cream to smoothen my feet. Foot cream and this scrapper are a  good combination to have healthier looking feet soon.
825. These nail clippers work as expected and are strong. They come in a tin case with a protective foam.
826. I have long been curious about Wen but am always leery of getting locked into automatic shipments which is what happens often when ordering from TV or a website. I found out that Sephora now sells it, so off I went to buy some. I was convinced that it was the answer for my sun-and-curling-iron-damaged hair. I bought the almond mint one there and tried it a few times; quite frankly at the time I was disappointed and returned to my regular shampoo & conditioner. Admittedly my hair was in pretty bad shape. Well, a few weeks ago I went to the salon and had about 8 inches cut off. And I tried Wen on it again and had several good hair days. I became curious about this orange blossom scent which is not available at Sephora so I ordered it...I actually buckled down and followed directions this time. It has taken some patience but I finally got the knack of how best to use it on my hair! My hair is now short in back, longer in front with bangs. The texture is medium-fine and I have a good bit of hair so it often looks thicker than it really is (humid climate plays a part in that!) First off: 10-16 pumps of this is far too much and takes forever to rinse out. The magic number for me is 5-7 pumps. Secondly, I use lukewarm, not cold water to wash and cooler water to rinse. And I do rinse well after leaving it on for the duration of my shower - this is very important as it will leave a film on my hair if I don't. Thirdly: I massage it very well into my scalp, adding a bit more water and then comb through to the ends.Both the almond mint and the orange blossom work equally well, so I know this orange blossom Wen is the real thing. My hair looks and feels better than it has in a long time; it has bounce, shine and holds a style beautifully! I now only use a tiny bit of mousse on my bangs and spray lightly with hairspray and do not need to comb or brush for the rest of the day even in high humidity. I do work outside and so the style does fall some by the end of the day but that is to be expected with an active job like mine. But the damage and dryness that had been plaguing me have all but disappeared since I have been using Wen. When I feel it creeping back, I just use the Remoist Mask by Wen and that fixes it straight away.A note on the scent: It really does not smell like orange blossoms to me, but it is pleasant with a fresh floral aroma and maybe just a hint of spice. I can still smell it faintly in my hair after blow drying whereas with the almond mint I cannot.I am really happy with this product and do not intend to ever use anything else on my hair again!
827. Really makes a difference with how my joints feel- and helps me to maintain a positive mood.Quality is great
828. Just as described
829. Always helpful
830. I got two packages of these for travel, I was not real fond of the strong watermelon flavor.  It was way too sweet for me, so I ended up sending back one of the packages. They do work well for sleep, but if you don't like watermelon or sweet, I don't recommend.
831. So glad I found this and the price was great! Very happy 😄
832. taking it for cancer
833. Works perfectly..we can't sleep without it!
834. The lid is cracked and leaked all of the liquid out poor packing and broken lid had to throw away not happy I wouldn’t recommend this product
835. Love this. Makes it so easy to carry my oils with me now
836. Good for pain
837. it takes a few weeks to receive this product, but they are great glasses.
838. I purchased this through a health food store.  I do have a coupe of sensitive spots on my scalp and it has managed to calms those spots of my scalp.  It does not take days to calm everything down, it only takes seconds.  I will buy this product soon.  It also eases the itching of my scalp and as far as I am considered this is a miracle.I did not know this product existed.  I found this while searching the supplement aisles at the grocery store.
839. The bristles are a little soft, but these are awesome and work well!
840. If you wear jewelry beware because your jewelry will get caught on this and could be damaged if you try to pull it off.
841. These don't work at all. In fact, they seemed to amplify some of the sound by reverberating basslow frequency in my ears. They were comfortable and soft silicone, but that means nothing if they don't work for their intended purpose.
842. Pleasant peppermint scent that really works. Seems like a great company to work with for natural products.
843. Can’t get over the taste. Tried mixing it in smoothies but nothing can mask the flavor. Tastes like grass.
844. The product themselves seemed fine but the gift box packaging was all scratched up. Had to send back and order a different one. It’s a good gift at an affordable price but my rating is cause I received a faulty one. Might reorder and update my review.
845. I wish it was faster but I think I can live with this.
846. The oviduct is very easy to use, non greasy, and covers the area very well. Plus the insects do not land on the skin that is covered with the product.
847. Best invention, no more dryer sheets and paper towel rolls ever again. No smoke is blown out as well which is a plus
848. I'd much prefer a smaller tablet - or even two for the same dose. They are hard and large, making them difficult to swallow.
849. I ended up not not being able to take this.  Myo-Inositol is great for Hashimotos.  I have elevated TPO antibodies and elevated TSH.  But I missed the addition of D-Chiro which *IS* great for PCOS.  But the D-Chiro portion lowers cortisol and my cortisol is actually already on the low side.  One needs well functioning adrenals to help with the Hashimotos so it is a catch 22.As a side note ... Cordyceps is supposed to lower TPO antibodies by 45% if that is something you need.So while these capsules are easy to take and did not upset my gut, I could not continue taking them.
850. This powder is a natural herb that touts benefits to your liver, including detoxification. In addition, it's supposed to contain lots of antioxidants, and antiinflamatort agents. It's a fine brown powder with a very slight earthy taste. I tried mixing it with some iced tea and ended up with lots of clumps... I think a better way to use this might be to sprinkle it on a salad, or if you were actually blending a drink like a smoothie.
851. Fantastic idea but tips over very easily.
852. I don't have this so I guess I sent it back without ever trying it, sorry no review then.... Don't even remember why......
853. A good product with proven calming ingredients. These ingredients overlap with some sleeping pills, and this product can make you feel tired. For many people, these pills are best for after the work day is over and closer to bed time.If you are hoping for a flow state at work or an alternative to ADHD drugs, this product is not intended for that. If that is your goal, start with 200-400mg of L-theanine by itself to see how far that gets you. L-Theanine is an inexpensive pleasant tasting powder and it will be calming without making you tired.The price, as I write this, is $1serving. That price is reasonable if you consider the premium ingredients, like KSM-66 Ashwagandha. You are paying for convenience by having a company blend powders and put them in a capsule. People in the target market can afford $1serving.The product is made in the USA at a GMP facility.
854. I have been buying these little guys for quite some time! I love them because they are unscented and they are not huge. This time when I bought them the packages are different… They do not have the same plastic lid and the biggest difference is the wipes are not layered within one another so that when you pull one out the next when it’s ready. There is no way little hands or fingers of little children are going to be able to figure out how to get the wipes out. I end up pulling out wads of them! I am not sure why this changed and I do not like it and I will not buy these again until I can be assured that they are layered so they come out of the container easy.
855. I have a lot of pain in my feet and after wearing these I have a lot less pain. These are very comfortable to wear and stay in place. It's like walking on a cloud!!!
856. I really like the taste of the Nectar brand. This particular flavor was very tasty. I mix mine with fat free milk.
857. This facial skin scrubber is not a bad little gadget. It has an easy to clean stainless steel spatula. The unit has 3 different settings, cleaning and moisturizing which are similar to each other and uplifting that is definitely different on how it vibrates on your skin.When you use it, it definitely feels interesting on your skin. When you use the cleaning and moisturizing settings you should use a cleaning solution or moisturizing solution of sort.The facial scrubber is a nice lightweight little unit that sits comfortably in your hand. It is very easy to operate and easy to use, you just have to figure out which setting you want to use. I really like using this. It is much gentler in cleaning blackheads and such then squeezing them with your fingers or using those blackhead tools that often damage your skin and also hurt. This is nice and gentle and actually feels good. It is not very expensive either so a nice little investment for your skin that should be worth it.
858. Doesn't work at all! Save your money
859. I bought this shoehorn to keep in my car. I have rods implanted in my spine and Parkinson's with neuropathy in both feet so I can't feel my feet nor can I touch them. As such I need help putting my shoes on and its surprising how many times you need to remove your shoes when you are out and about. At home I use a solid one piece shoe horn 32" long which has obvious benefits but you cant exactly carry it around in your pocket.This shoehorn folds down to a reasonable 14 inches and easily fits in a jacket pocket or the back of your pants. It only takes a twist of the wrist to lock or unlock the length and it is sturdy and affordable. This shoehorn works well and I would definitely recommend this to others.
860. Wow!! I am super impressed with this shaver. It works effectively to shave off my quarantine fur. It was easy to use & was fully charged upon receipt. I would definitely recommend this shaver to all!
861. I love baths so I was excited to try this.  It's so cool to see it dissolve and make a bunch of bubbles.  I really like the scent.  It smells so fresh and clean because of the essential oils.
862. Good purchase
863. Works great, exactly what I was looking for. Easy to put together too!
864. Unlike other filters, this one actually helps to reduce the amount of fog on my glasses. It is hard to wear a mask if you can't see through your glasses. This makes seeing easier.
865. Firm in both support and the cotton.
866. I got these for my wife.  She tells me they are easy to take but she really can't tell if they make any difference.  Sorry.
867. Been using for homemade ejuice for years.  No issues
868. I don’t know why I never thought about getting a pill box in the past, especially since I usually grab an empty medicine bottle (to carry Benadryl, aspirin etc) when I go out of town. And I always say to myself, I don’t want to mix my pills, but I also don’t want to carry multiple prescription bottles. So when I was offered these for an honest review, I said to myself, this really makes so much sense. And guess what? It does. Lizimandu has created some beautiful pill boxes, inspired by Van Gogh. These are perfect for people who travel or who have to take medicine on a regular basis. Each pill box is divided into 3 compartments. They are small enough to fit inside your purse, travelmakeup bag or book-bag. They aren’t that expensive and would be perfect to give as gifts. The only reason I am deducting a half of star is because I believe having a removable option (for the compartment) would allow people to put larger pills inside. Perhaps having the ability to twist the compartment and remove it would have made this 5 stars.
869. Soylent meal replacement. I've tried the original I'm not a fan of it of the flavor it's kind of blah but when you add in some fruits like pineapple or blueberries are bananas it really becomes pretty good. But over time you get tired of it. This flavor though is really good the chocolate. You don't really need any added ingredients to drink it. I do a dice kind of make it a smoothie in a sense. One thing I do got to say it goes by and I go through quite fast doing the measuring properly. Portable generator last about a week if you use it on a regular basis. I really love the product. I think buying the bottles is a waste of money. Especially if you're drinking you on a regular basis.
870. Cleans out what you don’t even know is there! Love it!!
871. Excellent for viewing photographic contact prints!
872. This basket fit right on my dads walker, he has one that has curved supports in the fromt. This hit right on , I don't think it would fit walkers with straight supports.
873. What a waste of money.
874. I love this stuff.  I have a low thyroid and use this all the time to stay &#34;regular&#34;.  It does taste a bit chalky if you don't mix with something.  I put in my morning smoothie and blend it in and it works great.
875. I purchased this product to use under Leukotape at the recommendation of my physical therapist. I've used it on my knees, feet, and back, and found it to be tremendously helpful in supporting my joints and relieving pain.
876.  Personally,  I hate seeing a review for a supplement from someone who has only used it a couple of times.  It's not long enough to determine if it really works or if there are significant side effects.  I actually took these for a full month before recording my experience.  Overall,  it was a positive one.I  have a spinal cord injury and like many wheelchair users, I have a problem with muscle spasms.  Using a magnesium supplement has worked better than muscle relaxers and without all of the nasty side effects.  This is a lower dosage than I usually use,  but the absorption is better apparently because it works just as well.  It's also a good choice if you are starting out.  It's not a high enough dose to cause digestive problems.
877. Love the selection of colors and that these are all hypo-allergenic. Perfect!
878. Hardly use it.  Not that great of a product.
879. Good material
880. Because everyone is hoarding everything and apparently decided Vicks will cure Covid-19 (it wont) my poor little immunocompromised kiddo was suffering with a chest cold.I searched Amazon and got the idea to type in "chest rub" and this little gem came up. And while it doesn't smell like traditional vicks (it smells amazing actually) she LOVES IT!!It leaves her skin soft. I rubbit on her heart surgery scar and it is softer now. We also put it on her back and feet. Ive barely made a dent in the jar. When it wears off she brings it to me knowing it will make her feel better.We will 100% be buying again.
881. For me this works great and I love that its 24hr, so I can get through the entire day without having to stop and remember to take another in mid day or so....
882. Brush TOO soft. Should be for children only. Brush head must be replaced EVERY month. Not good, not stated on description. Instructions had to be enlarged in order to read them! Merchandise returned.  :(
883. Great for whites keep them really bright with a combo Oxy and bleach. Oxy and  bleach throw them together at once the chemicals don’t agree with each other just throw Oxy  the same time you use the detergent then bleach has his own separate dispenser!
884. I use these bags all the time; however, after 1 or 2 uses they don't work anymore.  They are especially good for strawberries.
885. Excellent product.  Helps reduce coughing.
886. Wonderful set! Sturdy and well made!!
887. This is my go to “I feel like I got hit by a bus” medicine. I like that it’s a hot liquid and not a syrup that burns going down. It helps me feel better, and to get comfortable enough to get some sleep. The taste is pleasant- you can’t go wrong with honey and lemon with a sore throat and congestion. If they ever stop making this I’m gonna be in trouble.I LOVE YOU TheraFlu!!!
888. I use this everyday. So good.
889. Seems to do a good job stopping the itch without a horrid smell
890. My son love it! I would be again. It's fun, excited, and leaves no mess.
891. These lip balms contain essential oils. This is not disclosed in the ingredient list in the product description or in the seller's response to a question about ingredients. Those of us with allergies rely on this information being accurate, especially when a product claims to be fragrance-free. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this product when it was misrepresented on Amazon.
892. This stuff does exactly what it says it will do. Relieve pain and make you feel better.  Happy!
893. Love these! They work very well to keep baby happy and regular especially as we are starting to feed baby solids!
894. With Covid eyeglasses all fogged up we purchased this.  It kind of works.  The process to cleanapply is much different than regular eyeglass cleaner and you spray, smear it around until dry, and then wipe any streaks off.  The glass still fogged up from breathing but much less than untreated lenses.  Will keep and try again until I can figure this stuff out.
895. First, the good: This product comes in a package with a roller ball in it, so it is easy to apply topically. The bottle is dark, so it protects the oils inside.Now, the middling: The scent is tolerable, but not particularly mind blowing. It doesn't last long.Finally, the bad: I didn't notice that this blend of essential oils really did much for me. It certainly didn't offer me any relief, mostly because it wasn't strong enough to last for any length of time. I won't be buying this product again.
896. How did people clean walls before these? The magic part of the name is more accurate than anything I can think of.
897. These are really nice gift boxes.  Very fancy and can be used for any occasion.  Super easy to set up and the kids gold down nice.  Add a little tissue paper and your really ready for any small gift giving need.  Love the shiny color that is really suitable for any occasion.
898. I've been using turkey tail mushroom since 2014 ever since I was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. This brand is really good. Just one a day for the past couple weeks has been great. I don't feel as sluggish and I feel it does a great job protecting my liver.
899. Cut great so far time will tell how they last.
900. The Innate Vitality Krill Oil looks like a good replacement for another company's Krill Oil that was costing me almost double. I have been taking the product for almost 3 weeks now, 2 capsules daily, one in the morning and the other after dinner which is late, usually about 8 or 8:30. In that time I have not experienced any aftertaste, nor have I detected any scent except for a very slight one which is too be expected as all health supplements have their own unique fragrance.The jury is still out if this will help my irregular high blood pressure but I know it will take some time for my body to see the overall benefits but it seems from the research I have done that Krill oil has been proven, scientifically, to benefit your cardiovascular system. I will be ordering my next bottle shortly as they are out of stock right now and possibly go on a subscription basis, if one is offered.
901. Simple but attractive.  Tissue paper adds a nice pop of color.
902. I like these reading glasses a great deal for reading in reasonably good light.  In dim light I need stronger magnification, but for most uses, these are fine.  They are attractive and each pair has a carrying case, but the cases are a little tight.  I like this product because I like to stash reading glasses around the house, and these are reasonably enough priced that I can afford several pair.  All in all, highly recommended.
903. These are certainly small and lightweight, but if you are traveling to a location with complimentary shampoo I recommend just using the shampoo to wash your clothes. Most plain shampoos work very well as a laundry soap, but I'm not sure about the type with conditioner.  I had some pretty dirty hiking clothes and the shampoo seemed to get them cleaner than this soap.
904. I have on used two out of the box. They left me very tired the next day.
905. Too grainy, I had to keep stirring it to keep it from settling so I could drink it....
906. Exactly as expected. I just throw it in the washer when done. Works well on my floors, I recommend these.
907. perfect portions for brushing teeth, rinsing with mouth wash and a handy spray container for freshening up your breath as needed.
908. works as expected. no problems
909. Smells like a new unit was installed
910. great product, a bit expensive, but works well
911. These make great gifts! Love the lavender scent and the bombs are a nice size too. They last a bit and make your bath a relaxing spa. The tops have little lavender buds which is a nice touch.
912. I got this to help support my weak knee and get the benefits of the compression sleeve. I didn't want to wear two separate items when everything can be had it this one item. The sleeve is tight but I know that's the compression working. Once on, it's comfortable and I don't feel any discomfort. Wished it came in a 2-pack so my legs feel balanced but happy with it giving my one weaker knee support.
913. Very easy to mix into a shake or just water.  I usually mix mine into my morning glass of water.  Definitely noticed increased hydration.
914. This is amazing! I am a light sleeper and need white noise in order to fall asleep. It is loud enough for me! Was a little expensive for a white noise machine but I am very glad I bought it. Have been using it for 6 months and is working perfectly!
915. i cleaned all the markers that my little people did and it take a little elbow work but it works your walls and my side table in the kitchen is back to normal smells great it dont agitates my sinuses i need to get a huge tub of this stuff shines stainless steel to a sparkle on my sink just goobles up the water mineral buildup never using other stuff after this now i dont have to sand down my walls because of marker marks hope this helps someone out get this box first comes with a two different scrubbier and start getting the same stuff after that no disappointment
916. I used this after the cake foaming cleanser. The powder doesn’t come out as easily as I would like. I had to rub the blobs into my toy. I feel my toy is left clean and soft. The ingredients are nothing more than cornstarch so it’s pretty overpriced, but it works.
917. Either this is a bit awkward to use or I'm just not used to it yet. Since I use a shower bench, it's helpful to have a lower location for a shower head holder. The suction cup grips the tile really well but it's a bit hard to position the shower head in the holder, probably because I have a fairly large shower head. This product would be better suited to a small or medium-sized shower head.
918. every thing i needed
919. as described - recommended seller
920. Adorable little bundles!  Smelled wonderful too!
921. love and will buy again!
922. These smell a little fishy but other than that I am happy with these. They are vegetarian friendly, organic and non-gmo. I take spirulina for overall health. They are a superfood and very nutrient dense so I take them every day. The recommended dose is 6 so I split them up and take 3 in the morning and 3 at night. They are easy to take and easy on the stomach, and i could even take them on an empty stomach without nausea, or after tasteburps.
923. So glad I bought this.  We make our own bubble solution and it is so much cheaper than even the dollar store version.  The homemade stuff even works a lot better.  This stuff is great for bubbles.  I also found a recipe for bubble bath that I am going to try.  I would recommend this because it was a great price and it works well.
924. Listen people.  Call your vet and ask how to use this product.  I have this and our vet said use it after the special shampoo after she dries.  Use a little anytime you see itching. Massage into skin but don’t use much.  It’s not a rinse just after shampoo when wet.  Don’t complain something doesn’t work when you don’t know how to use it.  My dogs dermatologist  recommends this product.  Some people kill me because they don’t think.
925. Great for little ones. The color holds well and the design is cute.
926. These are so pretty and wash up great - hand wash. Would surely recommend.
927. I liked the effect from these CorneaCare Rescue: Self Cooling Hydrogel Cold Compress Eye Cooling Pads. Personally I preferred the cooling effect after putting them Eye Cooling pads in the fridge before using but I found them to be very helpful with my dry eyes and puffy eyes from allergies.
928. I chose these cases because of the way they look and having the tools with them in the case, therefore I could see my contacts through the top. To my surprise the cases are NOT LEAK PROOF!!
929. It may be a particular brand of tennis shoe, but when I walk for long periods of time in them, my toes start to hurt. Usually it is my second toe and it hurt like it was sprained.  Anyway, I am overweight and attributed a lot of the problem to my weight, but noticed with other sneakersflip flops, etc. with the same distance when walking, the pain didn't happen.  The tennis shoes were expensive and it was too late to return them so instead of losing out on being able to wear them entirely, I thought to try these.  They worked and they worked well.  I don't experience that same pain in my toes or when it does, it is after walking over two miles and not on the first mile.  A fairly inexpensive fix to the problem, but next time I go to purchase new walking shoes, I will try a different brand.
930. I have these in each room because I usually have my hands full when entering a room.  I don't have to get out of  to turn off the lights to go to sleep.
931. Just what I needed to balance my walking step due to one leg being slightly shorter than the other which my doctor prescribed for me. Perfect plus very fast shipper. I am highly satisfied.
932. I love these gel inserts as I have the double wammy of foot issues.  I have heel spurs and planters fasiicitis.  Because of back issues I don't wear heels, flats are the only way for me to roll. I switch them around to different shoes.  So inserts are my best friend, you laugh as I make such a big deal outta inserts, but there are those out there in Amazon land that know what I am saying.  You get 2 pairs for $5.99, that's a good deal.
933. I thought it was like I had years ago but things change ... I returned it, not a sticky and although it worked somewhat, not what I had expected.
934. Used to clean outdoor furniture cushions and it did a great job.  Plan to purchase again.
935. Chocolatey, but not chocolate milk (I despise chocolate milk). Flavor reminds me of the inside of a 3musketeers candy bar. Liquify that, keep it thick, and that is what it makes me think of. It is really thick, could easily water it down (or use milk of choice), or add to blender with some ice and get something that tastes much like a milk shake (or Frosty, reminds me of a frosty when I do that).Not a "low calorie food, but is within the norm for drinks and powders of this ilk. I love meal replacement drinks over plain protein as the added vitamins, minerals, and fiber make me feel better than protein alone.  I make smoothies and use prefab nutrition drinks like this as a means to get something in my body when I dont feel like eating. I often dont have an appetite until half way through my day, but I will feel some low level hunger, and I know I need something to power me through my physical work day. So a simple smoothie usually works (and allows me to add in other supplements such as collagen, mushroom powder). That being said, at some point I am never quite satisfied with a liquid meal, but still dont want a meal. So I usually add in a few nibbles of something, whether it be fruit, veg, cheese stick, snack bar, etc.Works great as a snack, or even as a "dessert"Sweetened primarily with allulose, and finishes with some sucralose (Splenda!). I dont really have an opinion on either sweetener. I find both are very sweet, without an aftertaste, and I dont have digestive issues from it.Pack of six, 32 ounce bottles which contain 4 (8 ounce) servings (all told same as a pack of 24 bottles at 8 ounces each). I like the option of it having a few servings worth in one big bottle as it cuts down on packaging. But it also reduces my ability to just grab and go. However, they do carry these in other sizes!Price per ounce is very similar to others with blood glucose support in mind.I have to say, I didnt know what to expect. With my first sip, I was impressed with taste, texture, and how there was no odd taste or funny after taste. Really quite pleasing flavor. The extra thick texture makes it versatile. Thick makes it feel like a shake, and triggers belly into thinking there is something in there. But it also allows for it to be watered down some if you want something to sip.I'm impressed, and would recommend this. Of course, take a look at ingredients and decide if it is good for your needs.
936. My kids are super picky. It's like they know they are eating something for their health and immediately is "bad", BUT these are great! They love eating them. The flavor is not strong, but enough to be tasteful for them. They have a great consistency and are chewables.They are sugar free and thats really a plus.In times when health is so important this probiotics are the best.Like them!
937. GOOD PRODUCT BUT WRONG PRICE==ONE OF THESE AT WALMART IS 95 CENTS
938. Yosemite are high quality, and have reinforcement rings for holding them against the brick pillars on our four porch.
939. I love healthy delights chews. I think they are a healthy alternative to swallowing a pill and they taste good too. Almost as an appetite suppresant. I will always  purchase these chews when I can.
940. My 7 year old loves this. It had multiple settings and it helps him brush for a full 2 minutes.
941. I believe this product does help the pressure in my eyes.  I will continue using the product.
942. Very good quality urn, easy to remove lid and it stays on tight...the map is beautiful although the reason it only has 4 stars is because across the top of my lid there is the alphabet?  I don't understand it?  It's called a world traveler urn...my brother was a world traveler so I thought it would be great for him....everybody that sees it says why is the alphabet on the top and I really have no answer...besides that everything is as described....thx!
943. Excellent product for the price.  Even gave some away to fellow traveler during recent cruise.
944. Not 2.50 Power Reading Glasses, don't know what they are because someone has taken the size off the arm, should be printed like the first pair I bought but isn't. No wonder the shipment was late.  I purchased these before and love them, but this time they are defective, scratched, late, and wrong power. Seller's quality control is very very bad.
945. I didn’t realize it’s going to change structure of my soup, like jello and I don’t like it. Now thinking how can i use it. Good things is it doesn’t change a taste!
946. I love this loofah.  It is especially helpful for getting rid of dry skin in winter when I'm cooped up in the house with the drying furnace turned on.  The length is fine for me--5'8" and it would fit a shorter person as well.
947. Don't know how clean it makes my teeth, but I love the taste of the Splashin' Citrus. I could eat it. Actually why not; Bentonite is edible and so is citrus. I have tried various forms of the Redmond toothpastes, but I hate trying to get the last of the paste out of the plastic tube. It makes me nostalgic for the good old days of the metal tubes that stay rolled when you roll them. With the new plastic tubes, you probably lose about 14 of the toothpaste in the tube.
948. A lot of ribbon.
949. Very cooling and soothing, but almost to the point of being too strong. Provides relief almost immediately.
950. Does the job.
951. Easy to take great energy without tingles &jitters you easily pump for 90 mins and not know it.
952. I love them so much.I have given some away and ordered more!Both orders came exactly the way I ordered them... Saturday my second orderI ordered them alone were packed 2 pks in a plastic bag with a tie and then in a strong Amazon shipping bag .Perfect Thanks for the Best product everI am struggling with this Diabetes and I am having gastric bypass surgery and how I eat is very important to me! Those bags have become a part of my daily eating regime... Thanks for making my life better
953. I really wanted to like this but I just can't. It has several features that just don't work for me. Although it fits OK, the elastic is heavy and the velcro closure is very stiff. Overall it is quite uncomfortable to wear. The velcro, if not closed very carefully, catches on the wrap and already there are fabric pulls where it has snagged the wrap. It is also a very thin fabric, and affords no warmth when you get out of the shower. Also I don't find it particularly absorbent. It would work I guess, as a &#34;modesty&#34; cover-up if you were in a public place - like the gym showers, but other than that I can't say much about it that's positive. Sorry but this is a 2 star product for me, at best.
954. Keep these in my tool box, around the shop & even in my truck.  Handy for an assortment of uses.  Hold a good edge & can cut through webbing, fabrics, jeans, thin metals and even wire in a pinch.
955. I am THRILLED with the results I have had with the Jigsaw Health-Magnesium wSRT. Not only has it lowered my BP by 40 points, it has brought my sugar level down to normal levels. My doctor said that if the reading continue like this, she is taking me off my RXx!
956. Just what I was looking for.  Extras are nice too.  Box seems to be made well.
957. Product was not what was expected
958. These are great. They keep pairs of socks together, and reduce sorting time. So far (about 6 months) they have been pretty durable. I've purchased more to add to the household, so I'd say they are good, at least at our house.
959. Creates a good foamy lather in under a minute, bristles have not fallen out and the knot is tight.  Initially has a musky odor and only issue would be that the handle is pretty wide- I have big hands and it is a difficult to get a comfortable grip.  But overall I am satisfied with the product
960. the smell is perfect love it I read reviews before the purchase and they were right better than Ax cannot go wrong with a brand that has been around forever
961. I very rarely wore sneakers or athletic shoes prior to the pandemic as no matter what brand I bought (Dr. Scholl’s; Etnies; Reebok; Skechers) they hurt my feet. I even tried gel inserts – nothing would help.I often, and with great success, wore flip flops. I wore them at theme parks, at a racetrack, running errands.But, I still craved the security of a sneaker.I decided to get these, and thought they’d work.The BIGGEST issue – no guidelines to cut the insert. And, for what they’re charging paying customers (I got a complimentary review product) – that is really unacceptable. Even the cheap Dr. Scholl’s have guidelines.As far as comfort? These inserts were a tad too stiff and rough. With my feet already having issues – I didn’t want to wait a good two weeks to see how well they worked. Then again, due to the pandemic – that two weeks might be months as I don’t go out. I mostly due curbside, drive-thru, or delivery for what I need.Given the mixed reviews – I don’t think I’d get these again and I would caution against anyone I personally know, purchasing them.
962. Got this for my 13yr. old grandson-he carries it with him always.
963. Delicious and nutritious. These help me feel better and taste fantastic. Pineapple flavor. But not overpowering.
964. This is my 4th or 5th pair of sleep headphones. Each set has been slightly different.  These are the most comfortable by far.  The padding around the eyes is a perfect addition.  Also the adjustability via the velcro type band is very helpful.  My ears are low set and I have trouble getting a good fit on most headwear or glasses. The system connects easily and sounds fine.  I would prefer a flatter smaller speaker as these can be a little bulky feeling if you lay on them. But at this price point, I still love them.  Battery life is good too!
965. I would love to be able to say that this helped me with stress. But I can't. I couldn't tell a difference. I even tried some on my dog to see if it would make a difference. No, it did not. But it didn't harm either of us. Maybe this isn't strong enough for me. Or maybe I couldn't tell a difference because of my meds.
966. Beware! These came shipped fine (shipping container in tact's) but the  tegaderm boxes have smashed corners that look like they've been sitting in liquid. They smell like chemical. I attempted to do a return and was told "there are no returns on this item" despite just opening the package today after receiving it 4 days ago.This is a pretty expensive loss to take and if you need this for medication patches like I do, it's quite a bummer. Go somewhere else to purchase.
967. These are great! So beautiful and you can feel the quality of the grit on the files themselves. I’ve owned quite a few brands of glass files before and I’m so glad I found these.
968. Doesn't stay in place and too large.
969. This is a great way to add antioxidants to your food! I prefer fresh, but it's not like I can find Acai berries at my local grocers! SO this is the next best way to include them into your foods. Easy to use, versatile - add to yogurt, smoothies, etc.
970. Unfortunately this flavor has milk in it... disappointing, but I will continue to buy the COLD BREW COFFEE flavor that tastes good & has no dairy.
971. This is the first time that I can honestly say I couldn't wait to write a review because I am so pleased.  I ordered these for my boyfriend who has an average build but is 6'5" and needed something to keep his medication on for psoriasis while he sleeps.  The gloves at all the drug stores in our area said large but actually seemed like they were a child large.  I read many reviews hoping to find something like these gloves.  THESE GLOVES ARE AWESOME!  They stretched perfectly and were very comfortable to wear all night. Although they were snug to put on the first time, he said the ointment did not get wiped off of the tips of his fingers and knuckles where he needed it.  I will definitely be ordering another pair.  He is so happy to have a product that is actually able to give him some relief.  I can't thank you enough!
972. Great for packing light
973. This is by far theeeeee BEST moisturizer!! I buy all that I see in the store & then I buy more- my husband has severe psoriasis & this is a relief. It’s thick but rubs in so smooth. My skin is soft until the next day!
974. Too tight
975. Best sleep aid on the market.
976. This is initial review. Got this 4-5 days back. Was very easy to set up and connect with the network and the tracker. However, getting inconsistent results. To elaborate, did everything right viz. place it on the hard surface, keep it at the same location, weighed myself keeping my feet bare and dry. Weighing myself  3 times at interval of one minute just to check the consistency and getting different results for weight as well as body fat %. It varies by .5 to 1 pound in terms of weight and 1% in terms of body fat. Anyone else experiencing the same?
977. I love trying different protein flavors to switch it up from my normal vanilla. This piña colada one is definitely a new favorite!! The flavor is spot on and not too sweet or artificial flavored. One of my favorite ways to enjoy this is mixed into some plain greek yogurt. I serve myself a half cup to a full cup, mix in a half to full scoop and then let it chill again a little bit before eating. It completely erases any hint of whey powder and it's just a nice sweet treat (that's high in protein and low sugar!). It dissolves easily in yogurt as well as in milk when I use it for shakes. I didn't experience any bloating or digestive issues. Highly recommend if you're looking to try new flavor!:)Hope this review is helpful!:)
978. Seems to be working good.  Helps out dry brittle hair.
979. Great product. Its very sturdy, and the blades are sharp enough to cut without much effort. A nice change from the standard cheap and flimsy little clippers.
980. Great after my foot surgery. Makes a difference
981. This is a really great first aid kit. It has 250 things and that's plenty of things that I need to help take care of my family if an accident happens. No one wants an accident to happen but if one does I have a kit that has everything I need and then some. It's great it's a nice little bag all well organized and put it right where it needs to be with a nice little handle so I can carry everything when I go.I really like this it has a little bit of everything to cover a little bit of everything if it happened. I'm glad I found this kit and was able to purchase one for my family.I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review.
982. Works great, cheaper than Walmart
983. Awesome product! Happy customer.
984. Good product but the mattress is a bit hard for my liking so I am returning it.
985. sticks even on greasy surface
986. Part of the daily regimen for knee pain.As expected.
987. Fit perfect and you can handle hot things without a problem
988. This is a smart little case.  It has sections and a divider to allow for separation of items, which is helpful to prevent necklace chains, earrings, etc, from getting all jumbled together.  However, because it does have dividers, it has a bit of thickness to it.  While this is a good, well-made case, I'll bet someone will create a jewelry organizer soon that will keep items separate without adding the extra fabric that is in this one.  I also wish it came in other colors.  When it comes to jewelry while traveling, my preference is to have a bright color that cannot be overlooked on a dresser top or inside a hotel safe when packing to leave.  How 'bout a bright neon green?If you find this review helpful, please let me know by using the voting buttons.

989. All the formulas are easy to use. Unlike other pens, they aren't overnight ones so you do have to time it and remember you started.Results aren't mind-blowing but there are results so great
990. Very soft and holding up pretty well to washes.
991. this thing is a godsend. i was spending $100 on acupressure spa visits to lessen the pain in my neck. Using this the first time, brought tears to me eyes because it was so damn good. i was able to target the abd spot right where i needed it the most, plus the heat helps, wish it was more heat. i also wish the handles were loops because its a tad awkward to readjust from neck to upper or lower back as you have to remove from from inside the cuffs, minor thing really. but being able to hang arms inside the cuffs means you get to control how mnuch pressure is applied which is the key to delviering the massage. i was impressed at how well made this thing is, very good stitiching and love the red glow you get from the item. For the price I paid, its amazing value and really does work, it has helped to reduce my neck pains. I use it before going to bed and wake up with much lesser pains in my neck, I only wish I had bought this item sooner. I wish the nodes could be spaced further apart, its fixed position. this thing is really meant to be used mostly on the neck but since you can move it around you can target those sore spots any where. also works wonders on the lower calf!. not so great on lower back for me, nodes too close but again simply move it around to target the spot. I also wish the power cord were longer, you almost need a extension cord if you want to use it where ever, so keep that in mind, you'll need a power outlet where ever you plan to sit for the next hour!
992. This is a rather large product, but I like the shape and how it can stand up on its own on the carpet. It has lights on it that fluctuate to different colors, but if you are using it when you are sleeping, the lights can be turned off. It has several different levels of use and you can turn it on high to get the most heavy air cleaning. Seems to work well and it's easy to remove and clean the filter.
993. This stain remover is different than other ones I've used. Its like a deodorant stick style dispenser. I used it on paint and fruit stains so far and it worked very well. It could be used for a large variety of different stains and its easy to apply- rub it on and let it sit for 15 minutes, and then wash in warmhot water. My kids always get all types of stains on their clothes, especially white, so this comes in handy. A couple minutes after you apply it, you could see the stain remover interact with the stain. The scent is not overpowering and has a fresh smell. I love that it's for sensitive skin, biodegradable, and natural, doesn't contain chemicals.
994. I use this to wash my face with my rechargeable facial tool  after removing my makeup. It is gentle, smells clean, doesn’t strip the natural oils, and has a great price point.
995. I use this product every day.
996. Great smell, and it's safe for my son who had severe eczema.  I get complimented all the time on how our clothes smell and it's because of this and the dryer spray that method sells.
997. This is great!
998. Good for the baby!
999. The other brands, especially the "menthol ones", are like hydrochloric acid up your nose with a pinch of eucalyptus. They burn. They don't work as well, for me. 4-Way is the best, fastest acting and has the least amount of rebound. Superior to the oxymetazaline HCL that the more popular brand uses. Read your labels!
1000. There's a bunch of tiny brushes.
