1. This review is more to clarify someone else’s review bc they didn’t understand understand the labeling!  It shows 1000mg as advertised & another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium!  I realize not everyone takes chemistry, but 4 ppl liked his review & so misinformation is spreading.  This works. If however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr & ask for a medication called Linzess which works must better & must faster, but is unnecessary for most people.  If magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food & drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.  Staying hydrated will really help.  Before switching to Linzess I used to take one 1,000 mg pill am & pm every day with meals & always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid.
2. Love these easy multitasking bleach tablets. Beats carrying home a big old jug of bleach.Walmark has been out of them since pademic hit and was so glad to find hear.
3. I have been suffering a couple months with heel pain from plantar fasciitis.  I thought I'd give these a try and wow, I was surprised at how much they cut down on the pain.  I wish they came in a tighter and thicker version.
4. It's cheap and it does what I wanted.  The "massage" function is a joke though.  It comes with 3 little plastic parts that you can scrape your feet on.  Not sure why they even bothered with that.  But it's nicer than sticking your feet in a plain tub.
5. Didn't do a thing for me. Not saying they don't. just not for me..
6. I have never been big on vitamins, with the exception of the occasional multi-vitamin. However, during the pandemic, I started on a daily regimen of taking Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 and Zinc every morning and an additional Vitamin C at night. This is a large bottle of three hundred tablets (enough to last me for three months). I typically take all my vitamins on an empty stomach and I have had no ill side effects from doing so. Everyone should be taking these daily to strengthen your immune system (even if you are vaccinated). Highly recommend!
7. To be honest, my husband did not use this for a balding head. He wanted to try it for his face and for noseear hairs. This is his review. This was a nice man's shaver. It has several attachments which are easy to change out and install. The shave I got was super close and it was easy to maneuver it over the contours of my face. I have to admit it is one of the best shaves I have had in the past few years and for the money it is a good deal. The nose trimmer worked well with no pain or irritation. Highly recommend.
8. This is a nice basic sound machine. I have used sound machines for years now to aid in getting a quality night's sleep. I have been using Alexa for the past year or so for my sound machine, so I was actually looking for a machine I could take with me when I travel. This is really nice, super compact and can go everywhere. My deduction of a star is only because of the loop, I can her it when the system reaches it's 90 second interval. However, once I am asleep it is barely noticeable and has not disturbed my travel sleep. I will keep this is my overnight bag and will continue to use it when away from home.
9. This are super colorful great gift giving holiday bags and tags. I always give smaller gifts to neighbors (sometimes home made baked goods, sometimes a bottle of wine). These bags are perfect for this. The drawstring is made of ribbon and seals the bag well. These would also be great for packaging teacher's gifts or for family gifting. Highly recommend. Nice variety, nice colors!
10. I guess the only product I have in my history of teeth whitening is Crest strips. These do not truly compare to them. These did not cling as well to my teeth as the Crestdo (I had to keep readjusting to assure they would stay in place). As far as actual whitening, I did see a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. The big plus here is that these are about 12 the price of Crest. So, if you are looking to save some money, these might be great for you.
11. This Jinri hair dryer is among one of the best I have ever owned. Strong and powerful, my hair dries super quick. It has varying speeds and heat levels which allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time. It also fits well in my hand, is relatively light weight, and I can maneuver from the front to back of my head easily. I love this red color as well and it matches my decor perfectly. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new, quality hair dryer at a reasonable price.
12. For positives, these are really nice, soft leggings. Super stretchy, high waisted and a deep rich black color. For negatives, they are too small for me. I am 5'7" and weigh about 150 lbs and they do not fit comfortably (definitely too tight). I will be washing them and giving them to my daughter in law who is much thinner. I really liked these, just too bad they aren't a tad more stretchier.
13. I live in Florida where hard water is definitely an issue. I just purchased my house last September, and recently retired, and I am trying to be careful on spending money. Many of my neighbors have been installing whole house water systems and although I do think at sometime in the future I will look into it, this filter has helped me at least in the shower. I can tell the water is better since I installed it (yes, installation was super easy for me) and my hair feels so much softer and I see less spots on the shower glass doors. For the money, this is a great shower filter and I highly recommend it.
14. Great way to supplement your daily smoothiefruitveggie shake with vitamins. Given that this is certified organic, Vegan & Non-GMO, it is a great all natural way to give your body an extra boost of Vitamin C. I am deleting a star simply because when I first tried to mix this in just juice, I saw that the powder does not mix well (my juice was cloudy). However, I started instead to mix it with my smoothies and it worked perfectly. No taste, blends well when the mixture is thicker.
15. This is my new favorite daily vitamin. Totally Vegan, easy to swallow and fills all the daily requirements of my 60+aged body. I have a tendency to skip breakfast most days a week and this vitamin agrees with an empty stomach (no aftertaste, burping, or unpleasant stomach rumblings). This is a lot cheaper than my usual Centrum formula so Amazon has once again turned me away from name brands and over to their store brand names. I highly recommend for any woman over age 40 who cares about their health!
16. I have a mild form of IBS and have been taking probiotics (in pill form) for years now. I thought I would try something different by using a chewable variety and I was thrilled when I saw this. I was a little skeptical with the title of 'Dark Chocolate' and it brought back memories as a kid of chocolate Ex-lax flavoring. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The flavor of this chewable probiotic is absolutely amazing. It actually makes me look forward to taking my daily probiotic to help keep my IBS in check. Since taking this, I do feel better and my bloating issues have definitely decrease. As we all know probiotics are good bacteria and everyone (even without IBS issues) should be taking probiotics daily just to help your digestive system perform optimally. If you are looking for a type of probiotic that you can actually like taking, and you love chocolate, this Digestive Advantage Dark Chocolate will definitey fill the bill!
17. Great pre and post workout mix. Yes, it has aspartane but then again, the last thing I want in my diet is more sugar. I thought the taste was a little sweet, so I did dilute this more than the recommended mixture (you will probably need to do the same depending on your taste). High in electrolytes and protein, this is great for my Florida workouts with the heat and humidity (and I lose more water sweating than in probably any other area of the country). I was previously a Gatorade drinker, but I honestly prefer this Science in Sport and will be buying more.
18. it was a nice tray  smaller than i expected but my walker has  rubber grips and the tray didnt fit over it  - now what do i do ?  buy a new walker ?  idk what to do to be honest  im assuming all trays will have the same issue due to those grips  companies should realize walkers come with grips and make the trays fit either or somehow
19. This not only provides a nice scent, but it's also a great way to disinfect & remove wrinkles.Please Lysol, never stop making this, it's an amazing product!
20. I love this set & definitely will be purchasing more in the future! This set has everything you need to smooth & shape the nails. I highly recommend!
21. Does a great job cleaning.
22. Purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder.  It IS less messy than regular powder, however, it doesn't work as well.  And it is oddly... greasy?  He reports that it is lotiony in a weird way.  Since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry.  If it's lotiony or greasy, not so much.If you're hoping for a replacement for powder - this isn't it - at least in my husband's opinion.
23. My husband is a big guy with a beard - further - in my opinion - an unusually large head.  So finding washable masks for him as been a real challenge.  These masks are really big.  Fully cover his nose, face and beard.  He really like the comfort of the ear loops which are also part of the "adjustablity."  I am not a huge fan of the hanging mask (for sanitary reasons - "don't mess with your mask" etc)  BUT it does keep the mask from being put down - possibly leaving germs on surfaces - and then picking them up again.  They are washable - highly important to me.  They are simple black.  Nothing fancy.  The point is, they will work.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  Having said all of that, I just ordered 12 a dozen more for him to use.
24. In this day and age of excessive hand washing - I HAD to have some of these to save my poor, cracked over washed hands - still have to do the dishes.  They are extra long.  I consider myself to have a medium size hand and they are snug - but not too.  Comes with a set of 3 in 3 different colors -- that happen to work for spring right now - but who really cares.  My hands are grateful.
25. Husband is type 2 diabetic and with the combo of meds he takes, occasionally low blood sugar is a thing.  These are easy and measured.  He really likes the grape taste, but lets face it, they are really an emergency fix - so taste makes it easier to get down - which is what is most important.  The travel tube is very handy.
26. Good price, effective, refillable.  I use these for soft scrubbing cleaning.  Keep one in the kitchen and each bathroom.  I purchase the bulk bag of baking soda to refill the shakers.  A great companion purchase.  Add a little vinegar to the sink or whatever you are cleaning with baking soda for a disinfecting property.  All natural.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  And I hope this info was helpful to you!
27. Husband likes these because the bristles are pretty stiff... he likes a nice, firm back scrubber.  They seem to hold up.  I will update should new info seem useful.
28. I thought the &#34;adjustability&#34; of this shoe horn would be good.  And it might have been... EXCEPT for the spring just above the horn.  It makes the shoe horn completely unusable as it bends at the spring!  So... your foot won't slide into the shoe!  If you need a little extra length because bending over is an issue, definately go for the solid, long handle.  I just pitched this one and purchased a solid long handle shoe horn.  Works like a dream.  For the life of me I cannot imagine how anyone thought this one would work.  Garbage.
29. Very nice.  Looks just as pictured.  I put a yarn project keeper, some yarn and a couple other small items without trouble.  The measurements given were active.  The ribbon is lovely, thick satin ribbon and is white.  Plenty of it with lots of tail after closing the top.  The material of the bag is thin, but effective - I can't see through it.  I would buy again.  It's a lovely, reusable gift bag. It arrived quickly (I have prime) and in great shape along with other items I ordered.
30. First... I purchased these directly from the manufacturer - thus it doesn't say &#34;verified&#34; purchase for me.  I went to the manufacturer because I wanted to try a smaller set (1 month set) which was not offered on Amazon when I purchased it.1.  A &#34;one month supply&#34; is really only a one WEEK supply - the &#34;effects&#34; are supposed to last one month.  Misleading to say the least.  Should say it's a ONE WEEK supply.2.  I took pictures that show NO difference to my eye.  NOTE:  I used exactly as described on instructions.  ALSO... my front, top 4 teeth are 15 year old porcelain overlays.  Supposedly this system is safe AND effective on dental work as well as natural teeth.  I didn't see it.3.  It is messy and a two step process... Tube # 1 is the a super stain treater and then tube #2 which you apply after using tube #1.  The pic I have included was after tube #2.  NOTE:  The tubes themselves were a serious pain... most of the time they were extremely difficult to get open even with &#34;careful bending&#34; per instruction.  I think I had ONE tube that actually opened without considerable force, which causes the swab to be displaced making it more difficult to apply the treatment.  They also include a tube that you are to use while you are out and about and have eaten or had something to drink that could be potentially staining.  It has a soft brush like tip.4. Initially the solution didn't really effect me one way or the other, however by the end of the 7 days my gums were very sensitive.  I have a sonic toothbrush with an all purpose name brand toothpaste and brushed my teeth prior to each treatment, which I chose to do in the mornings.5.  It is obviously a peroxide formula of some sort.  You can taste it.  With a bit of mint or something mixed in... but there is no hiding the peroxide flavor.6. In the end, photos don't lie.  I don't see any improvement at all.  Photo number 1 is before... Feb 17... Photo number 2 is Feb 23.  The rest were photos I would like to see if I were considering a purchase.  Hope it helps.In my opinion these are a waste of time AND money. I included the photos so you could make your own decision.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, but honestly, I will not be buying these again either from the manufacturer or from Amazon.
31. Bought these for my husband.  They have a good grip and were easy to hold onto.  I also likes that they have a larger clip area as your toenails are larger than your finger tips, general speaking.  They are heavy and sharp.  I feel as though they will last for some to come. I never hesitate to update my reviews if new info should seem useful.  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in good condition along with a few other things I had ordered.
32. I got this to help with a edible tincture and it works very well.  I must say that a small portion goes a long way.
33. I bought these to wear when I take my contacts out.  FYI, they are a little wide.  I am a girl and I think they are meant for big headed boys.  :)  All the same, I love the style.  Just wish they were a little bit tighter at the temples.  The appear to be good quality and I don't see any distortion in the lens.
34. was just as described, very happy with purchase.
35. Removes odors effectively and has a nice smell.
36. Jury still out. Getting used to.
37. I bought two of these. I have an expensive one at home and needed something smaller and less money for work and for when I travel. Though it may not be "as powerful" as my expensive one at home, it does the job. I keep the one at work in a cosmetic bag, with toothpaste, toothbrush and a small mouthwash and it's perfect to tote to the restroom after lunch and keeping my teeth clean. The other is in my travel cosmetic case, so when I go out of town - I just charge it up and off I go. For $9.99, you can't beat the price.
38. More of a dull gold vs bright gold
39. very  nice  bags,  elegant  look  and  excellent  packing in  its  own  wrapped  box.  I  have  purchased  again, and  you  will  be  happy
40. The first time I used these socks, they were difficult to pull on, but after washing were easier, and so worthwhile!
41. I got this for my mom as a gift and she loves it! Crap i love it! Fast shipping too! Will buy again!
42. good size and sturdy
43. I give this a solid 4-stars because it contains lots of good ingredients and tastes reasonably good.  I thought it seemed to help my digestive system, but haven't taken it long enough to know for sure.  The only problem that I found with this is that it doesn't mix up really well in a glass of water.  You have to stir it quite a bit and you still seem to have small pieces and residue that doesn't mix in well.  This is the first time I have really tried a "superfood".  I tried the green one (vegetable mostly), but am thinking of also trying the red (more fruit, I assume).  For less money, you can probably buy fruits and veggies that will give you the same nutrition, but this may be more concentrated and probably a decent partial substitute for not eating correctly.  The only bad ingredient that I could see is that it contains some sugar.
44. Love this product!!!! Will order more. So easy to use & stays strong
45. A little difficult for kids to use but ok for the price
46. Unfortunately I’m returning this item. I tried it on and it was fairly simple to figure out how to adjust it. It definitely felt like it was pulling my shoulders back and I could instantly feel a bit of relief from my poor posture. However once on and snug, it cuts into my arm pit area too tightly. It may be my size or my sensitivity level. I’m a female, 5 1’ and weigh about 125. I don’t not recommend this product since it seems like it would be effective, it just wasn’t for me.
47. While this didnt seat on my walker bars well, it worked great for picking things up.I got the 26 inch one because the 36 in. one picked up good but it was a long reach to grab what I picked up. This one is perfect! It is a very sturdy piece of material especially the grabbing fingers. There is a rubber coating so what you pick up, doesnt slip out.
48. My uses it everyday
49. I’ve only used these cups a few times as my husband shares his coffee with me & this cup & amount is perfect.I previously bought another brand that came with a clip on handle and they are okay for store sampling, one time use, but since I could feel the hot coffee, I had to use two.These cups are thicker & sturdier as I’ve used them multiple times since my husband makes 3-5 coffees per day, depending on if we share them and I’ve haven’t had to replace the cup because of multiple uses even if it sat for awhile in between cups.I would definitely recommend and I would definitely rebuy.
50. Very satisfied with this purchase. For the price it's a great value and cheaper then the party stores I think. Only a handful were broken and out of 250 items I tho k that's good. Didn't know it had so many tattoos though and is mostly the slappy sticky toys
51. These gummies aren't soft at all.  They are hard and stick to the teeth.  The flavor is good and the fiber is good, but just much to hard.
52. This product is relaxing.  It is a little expensive, but it's nice and soothing.  It's made in the USA.I would buy this product again.
53. I'm kind of between a 6 and a 6 12 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose.  These pads help with the 6 12 for the ones that are a little loose. Adds a bit more comfort for long wear.
54. Great for little ones. The color holds well and the design is cute.
55. These fit as expected and fit well.  They are snug as to be expected with compression socks.  The color and style are cute. They wash well
56. Even when sitting the tabs come off.  They don't stick well.  The TENS unit stimulates like it's supposed to, but even when just sitting still the pads come off. they need better adhesive.The unit isn't rechargeable.  You have to use batteries.  You can buy rechargeable batteries for it.
57. Blends great, very subtle flavor. I've used it for smoothies, but when I realized it doesn't taste awful, I started using it to cook toaster-sized protein pancakes to store in my freezer.
58. Blended well into my smoothies. Not much taste difference with the other vegetables and things.
59. The selfie stick is easy to use and easy to hold.  I love that it has the bluetooth remote.  So much easier than setting the timer for selfies. It extends to a good length and the tripod is a great bonus!  Love everything about it!
60. These wipes are great!  I love that they are flushable.  They clean well and have a pleasant scent.  These are portable packages.  I like the idea that you can throw them in a bag without having a bulky, plastic, space hog container. After problems with the septic tank, these are not good for the septic tank. I'm sure they eventually dissolve but not right away.You must know... The listing says it comes with 12 packs, it only comes with ONE.  In which case, you have to return the one package to receive a credit.  I didn't return mine in time, therefore, I paid $22+ for only one pack of wipes.  Not sure how this became my fault, but it is what it is.
61. I don't hate these but I don't love them either, they are okay but they don't curl my eyelashes as good as others I've used before, they just don't, they barely curl them at all not sure why and my assumption is that they just don't curl your eyelashes very well. On the flip side they are easy to use and do not slide while you're using them (at least hasn't happened so far) so that is a good thing I guess, if that is what you're looking for. Also they do come with refills and everything else so that's also a good thing. I personally have had quite a few moments where I have trouble using curlers sometimes so these are good in that aspect, but other than that I'd say they don't really curl very well.
62. Not a fan of this, it's very nice to stare at or as decoration for the bathroom, the little cup they come on is cute and they look pretty, bu otherwise as far as soap goes it comes apart super easily. I would have to say 1 soap lasted me for about 2-3 times on the shower. Honestly I only took them to see if they were nice and they fall apart super easily also have a rough texture to them which is kind of strange considering they come apart really easily. The soap doesn't feel like soap at all though and doesn't make a lot of bubbles either it's just weird. In my opinion if you want it as a visual for your bathroom or just for decorating it's really fine but as far as soap goes, I'm sorry to say, one of the worst I've bought so far :s
63. I have been adding collagen powder to my coffee for over a year now. I really like this one. It is undetected once in my hot cup of coffee. It dissolves very quickly and leaves no clumping. I have noticed improvement in my knees and lower back since using collagen. I will keep taking it for as long as I can!
64. I have high blood pressure. I have a wrist monitor, but I wanted a full size one. This one has a large, easy to read display. It seems to be pretty accurate. I am on medication for my hypertension and my results from it seem to be as expected. Batteries are included. It also can be charged with a USB C cable (included).
65. I have had a lot of blackheads lately and have been looking for ways to deal with them. I saw this and thought it was interesting. After several attempts, I'm not sure that I am using it correctly. The directions really aren't that helpful. My first attempt was painful! I had the device suctioning a blackhead and then I couldn't get the device off! I finally figured out how to turn it off and was able to release it, but it hurt! Luckily it didn't leave any lasting marks. I'm going to look up some videos to see if that helps me before I give up on it.
66. My husband makes a meal replacement shake for breakfast every morning. This plant based one has 15 servings in it. It mixes well with water. He does use a blender for the job. He usually adds some frozen blueberries. It's palatable. It does taste a bit "green" as many other plant based protein powders do. He says it's filling and satisfying.
67. I am just getting over the worst hemorrhoids of my life! I have had them a few times in the past, but nothing like this time. The itching & burning was excruciating! This has been quite helpful! This fits on the toilet without any problems. It's deep enough that you can add enough water to actually sit in. It collapses flat for storing. This is just the seat and does not come with any hose or spray attachment. I found that I didn't need that and this was more than sufficient.
68. My daughter likes to wear stylish sneakers that don't have a lot of arch support. She recently came home from college for a visit and only brought the shoes she wore with her which happened to be a pair of these shoes. She was using our home elliptical machine and complained afterwards because the shoes weren't very supportive. I ordered these for her to see if they would help. These inserts are customizable. They can be trimmed for fit and then there are little pieces that you can add under the arch area in case you need to increase the arch support. She says that they do improve the arch support, but she would prefer one with extra cushion support in the heel and other areas, too. Overall, she does like these and is much happier with her shoes since she's added these.
69. I have tried a few similar silicone face mask brackets and I feel that these really are the best! What makes them stand apart from the rest is the silicone strap. Basically, you are wearing 2 separate things - the bracket and your mask. After nearly a year of wearing masks, I have found these to be the most helpful when it comes to preventing my glasses to fog up. The silicone is very soft and non-irritating. The storage cases are an added bonus in my opinion. Love these!
70. Our guest room doesn't get very dark because of transom windows. I used to feel badly for our guests, but then I started keeping a basket with sleeping masks on the nightstand. The masks are always new, but for frequent visitors, I keep their chosen masks in a  labeled Ziploc baggie for their next visit. The masks have always been adult sized, so now I am happy to have one that will fit my preteen niece.  This is a thin mask, but it's very soft. It has a soft, fuzzy fleece fabric which is the same on both sides. The elastic strap isn't adjustable. I did try it on and it did fit snuggly on my large head, but it wasn't tight. It does block out the majority of the light. The dalmatian design is sweet. I think these sleeping masks would make a nice gift.
71. This is a nice basket of bath bombs. The basket itself is a decent quality. The bath bombs are a little smaller than I expected, but they seem to "explode" slowly so you can relish the experience for a moment or two. The bombs are individually wrapped in plastic which has been a little difficult to open. The first bomb that I used, said it was grapefruit, but didn't smell anything like the fruit. It had more of a flowery perfume scent. The next one that I used was the peppermint one and it did smell like peppermint so I don't know if the grapefruit one was mislabeled or not. The bombs haven't left any noticeable rings in the tub. This would make a great gift!
72. These masks are comfortable to wear. The material is soft and slightly stretchy. These do not have filter pockets, nose bridge wires, or adjustable ear straps. I like the polka dot prints!
73. My husband and son prefer wearing the disposable masks, whereas my daughter and I like the cloth ones. After months and months of wearing the blue disposable ones, my son was actually pleased to have a different color! These are more of a dark grey than black, but it's something different! The mask quality seems to be comparable to other disposable masks. One thing that I really like is that these are packaged in small quantities so they're more likely to stay sterile until use.
74. My daughter and I like wearing pretty masks when we're out.  This is a cute, red bandanna print one. It's a little large, but we have some of those silicone pieces that we were able to slide on to the elastic so we can customize the fit better. They are made well, too.
75. My family follows a low carb diet. These low carb snack bars are quite satisfying. I was full for a good couple of hours after eating one. They are surprisingly soft and chewable. I expected them to be hard and dry, but they aren't. I would rate the taste as in between a 3 and a 4. They're definitely palatable. I've had some bars that I've literally had to force myself to eat. I found it easy to eat these. You're not going to mistake them for candy or treats. These would be easy to keep in your bag or take on the go.
76. This pill travel organizer is too cute! I love it! I only take 1 prescription pill, but I do take an assortment of vitamins and supplements. The slots in the primary case are large enough for the larger sized vitaminssupplements. It's geared for 7 days, and there are morning slots and evening ones. Technically, you could use this for 2 weeks if you combined your ampm pills. The compartments open and close easily. The pill box fits nicely in the carrying case. Did I mention that it's really cute?? It also comes with a smaller pill case too. I've use one like this for overnight or weekend trips. The compartments can hold my large fish oil capsule! I keep my small case filled with one or two of my prescription tablets and then keep it in my purse. Then if I realize that I forgot to take it one day or if I forget to bring it with me when I go out of town, I'm alright.
77. I started wearing sleeping masks to bed a few years ago. They really help when my husband stays up and watches TV or in the summer when the sun rises so early. These are light weight and very soft. They're adjustable so you can get a perfect fit. The block most of the light. I have found that a little light still comes in around the sides. They are comfortable to wear during sleep. I tend to forget to bring one with me when traveling, so I'm putting one of these in the pocket of my small suitcase so I have it with me.
78. This is a good selection of balloons for a graduation party. I loved the confetti filled ones! The numbers are huge, but one of the four numbers had a leak in it from the get-go. We taped it up, but it was never as full as the other ones.
79. Nasal sprays, like this, are great to have on hand, especially in the cold, dry air. It's easy to use and instantly moisturizes the nostrils. I am glad to report that while the listing says it is for a pack of 72, I only received one. There's no way I could use all 72 bottles before they expire!
80. I just turned fifty recently and have been taking multi-vitamins for the last several years. This one is a large, &#34;horse pill&#34; type vitamin, but I haven't had any problems swallowing them. They don't upset my stomach nor do they cause my urine to be bright yellow. I love that it comes with enough servings for about two months. I have noticed that I am not as tired in the afternoons as I usually am which I am attributing to these. They seem to be a good, basic vitamin.
81. I am a fan of Method Cleaning Products. I've been using the Method All Purpose Cleaner for several years now. I was trying to reduce the chemicals used in my home. One of my favorite things about the Method products, is the scent. This one has a light, apple scent which smells really nice. I have a stainless steel appliances in my kitchen. This cleaner does a pretty good job of removing finger prints, but I haven't had much luck with removing the water drips on my refrigerator below the water dispenser. The only thing that I have had any success with getting rid of those is the Bar Keepers Friend Stainless Cleaner. But now with this cleaner, I can use this for frequent touch ups on refrigerator and overall on the stove and dishwasher and use the other cleaner for the water drip marks.
82. The Mountain Falls Ultra Sunscreen is a very affordable alternative to the big name brand sunscreens. The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen, is that the scent is pretty mild. It does have the typical smell that goes along with products containing sunscreen, but it's not very strong at all. In fact, it's barely noticeable when you first open the lid of it. It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any greasiness behind. It seems to do a good job of protecting, as long as you remember to reapply it regularly.  Every year, I cringe at the prices of sunscreen out there. This is a non-cringe worthy, comparable product.
83. I am in my late 40's and can't see up close without my reading glasses. I recently purchased a vanity mirror for my bathroom with 5x magnification. I was horrified with what I saw! The wrinkles didn't bother me - that goes along with age. But I have lots of blackheads on my temples! I couldn't see them before. I have used the acne tools - the ones that look like dental tools and they work okay, but those often leave behind temporary redness. And you have to be precise about the location because of the small tips. I found this ultrasonic cordless skin scrubber to be much more effective at getting rid of the blackheads! And it doesn't leave behind any redness! The end of it is about an inch and a half wide and it is able to scrape out the ugly blackheads. You can see the dirt and grime on the tip after you've used it. Gross! Now as far as the scrubber goes, it comes with a charger. Once it is on, it has a vibration thing going on. It heats up a little bit, but not to the point where it is too hot to use or it burns. I just can feel a little heat from it while it is in use. There's a silicone cover to go over the metal end when it is not in use. I am thrilled to have found this!*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.
84. I have been looking for storage for my make up brushes. I've been keeping them in some cardboard desk organizer boxes, so this is a huge improvement!  The acrylic is quite thick. I have other acrylic make up organizers and not all of them are this thick. The wells are deep enough that make up brushes won't fall out. I once ordered an acrylic organizer geared toward brush storage, but the compartments were so shallow, that my brushes wouldn't stand up in it. I ended up using it for something else instead of storing my brushes. I'm not sure what I will use the smaller well for. It looks like it was designed to hold business cards. I'm sure I'll come up with something! I am very pleased with the quality of this organizer. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't hold all of my brushes! Or maybe I just have too many!*I received this for free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.
85. This is a basic, no frills diaper bag. Not only is it large, but it has a lot of pockets, too. I ordered this for a baby shower gift. I plan to use it as the gift bag & fill it with items for the baby. And since it's so large, I will have a lot of filling to do! Because of it's neutral design, it will function well for both mom & dad. I wish the handles and the shoulder straps were both a little longer and had some padding for comfort. The changing pad and the zipper compartment are appreciated!*I received this for free for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.
86. I recently purchased some lather cream for my husband as an alternative to his usual shaving cream. So when I was offered a coupon for a shaving brush, I jumped at the chance to get one so he could properly use his lather cream. He's been using his new shaving brush for a couple of weeks now and so far, so good. First of all, I was impressed with the packaging. It came in a nice box which would be excellent for gift giving. The handle is sturdy & fits nicely in your hand. The beaver hair is surprisingly soft.  My husband is pleased with the lathering that the brush produces. The brush did have some shedding at first, but as the description states, that's normal and after those first few hairs, my husband hasn't noticed any more shedding. My husband has never used a lather brush before, so he doesn't have anything to compare it to, but it appears to be doing a good job and he's pleased with it.
87. I don't have a lot of problems sleeping, but when I do, it's very frustrating! Last night I was awakened by an emergency alert on my phone. I was unable to fall asleep afterwards. After about an hour, I decided to try one of these supplements and it worked very well. I was able to fall asleep again. In the morning, I felt just fine. I didn't feel sluggish or tired. I usually take Tylenol PM or something like that and only on the 2nd night of having sleep problems. I will definitely use this instead of the Tylenol PM next time I need something to help me sleep!
88. Works great and very well made
89. No pain relief nor warmth . Was a real disappointment, if it was not a bad roll, this product advertising is a complete lie.
90. It's very cushioning; however, it's very slippery, it made my heels slip out with every step I take.
91. Great quality hot water bottle. Love it.
92. Barely makes any bubbles
93. Do not waste your money.  These are a joke.  They wrinkle up once they get wet and then the center never dries.  Its like trying to wash with a wrinkly piece of cardboard.
94. It doesn't have a temperature control and it doesn't cut off automatically, and it drys out my hair. However, I will say it makes nice curls on the shorter sections of my hair and it is a nice size.
95. I really like this pill crusher. It also has two storage compartments to store either pills or crushed medicine and a very nice pill splitter that adjusts for various sizes and shapes of pills.
96. DO NOT BUY. I purchased two packs and  received old products, the Tums were supposed to be chewy; however, they were dried out and hard. They are definitely not a chewy delight. Also, they are way over priced.
97. This polisher did exactly what I wanted it to do
98. These are poolshower quality ear plugs! I have bad swimmers ear, even in the shower 🚿, these come with the coolest metal keychain worthy container and a great lite neckstrap to hook up your earplugs , place the plugs in your ears and shower or swim 🏊‍♂️.. then just hang them up to dry out!
99. I like these reading glasses a great deal for reading in reasonably good light.  In dim light I need stronger magnification, but for most uses, these are fine.  They are attractive and each pair has a carrying case, but the cases are a little tight.  I like this product because I like to stash reading glasses around the house, and these are reasonably enough priced that I can afford several pair.  All in all, highly recommended.
100. Great little trimmer for nose hair and also other smaller hairs on face and ears. Easy to use and charge.
101. I like taking Ashwagandha as I find it helps me focus more on my workouts. Not that it gives more more energy but I just feel like I can finish all my sets without get board? Overall pleased with this Ashwagandha supplement. I take every day and it has not cause any stomach issues.
102. These seem like great quality cough drops with beneficial ingredients for when you are under the weather. A couple downsides for me are that the outside of them are rough so they cut up your mouth a bit and secondly no place saying where they are made. They have a mildly sweet and minty taste.
103. I sometimes get a stiff neck and my neck always hurts a bit to tilt back from some whiplash I got. I thought this would feel good on my neck, but it kinda just feels like it’s sharply jabbing into my neck. Maybe I need to do it more. Easy to use and well made. Need to give it more time to see if it makes a difference.
104. These are pretty crystals and stones. Nice to carry around to help with stress.
105. Seems like a quality product from a brand I trust. So far no stomach discomfort and seems like a supplement I can benifit from. Hoping it gives me more energy
106. Great tasting vitamin d gummies. Easy to take and seem like great quality.
107. I will be using this in between waxes. I have been traying to wax almost after every wash because the cars stay cleaner longer. I've switch to alternating with this  in between waxes and it provides the same amount duration. Very shinny and much faster than waxing. Waxing a mini van is no fun. :)
108. Great quality bags. Look just like picture. The handles come unattached but are easy to attach.
109. Compatible to Ensure. Not something I drink for fun or taste but when eating is a challenge like when sick or unable to eat solid foods. Or when I need to grab something quick that will fill me up for a while. Tastes better chilled.
110. Super cute gift bags. They would also make great reusable lunch bags. Come with thanks you tags and string to attach. Durable and make gift giving fun. Great to keep on hand for last minute gifts.
111. Very cute Halloween decorations that include a variety of items to decorate with. Will be fun to decorate with closer to Halloween. I know my kids will enjoy them when I put them up.
112. Great bags. Versatile and perfect for a variety of occasions. Well made. Easy to throw a quick gift into.
113. I wanted to try a cleanse that wasn’t a powder. This one has an interesting combination of ingredients, any of which seem like that would do the trick lol. Didn’t take long to start working. Definitely felt less bloated.
114. Great tasting protein powder. Seems to be a quality product as well. I added it to a blender with water and ice and it was a quick and satisfying protein smoothie. Filling and tastes great.
115. Seems like a quality product. I mixed a scoop with water, ice and frozen banana for a quick protein smoothie. It tasted great and was filling and satisfying.
116. This looks like a quality product. I’m trying out regular ashwaghanda currently but want to try this after a month of that. It seems really promising.
117. This olive oil looks good, smells good and tastes like high quality extra virgin olive oil. Took off a star because I don’t know if this is a reputable company for something I will be consuming. Also, Costco is known to have some of the highest quality Organic EVOO, so I usually just buy that.
118. This gives me the energy I need but the taste isn’t that great, kinda like surgery chemicals. I use this before weight training and light cardio. It mixes ok.
119. Doesn’t mix a well as other products I’ve tried. There is a blob of unmixed powder that’s suborn and won’t dissolve. This Watermelon flavor is strong and tastes much better than the mojito flavor. Performance wise it gives me the boost I need for my workouts. I can’t say it’s any better or worse as far as the energy boost goes compared to competing products.
120. These is a great sleep mask. I have a few that a too over the top. They just need to be like this one simple and soft. Silk is the way to go. You almost don't know you're wearing this. Fits well and is adjustable.
121. Great generic Vaseline. Has a light scent to it and works just as well as the name brand.
122. Seems to be a quality brand as I like a lot of their products that I’ve tried. This is good added to a smoothie, juice, soup, baked goods. It gives a nice color to recipes as well as added health benefits.
123. I’ve heard a lot of good things about this supplement and it’s many health benefits and how it’s been around for a long time. This was my first time tasting it and I heard it gets its name from how gross it tastes and it didn’t disappoint. It’s name translates to it smelling like horse. It was hard to get down mixed with just water, but it has such a strong taste that it would prob ruin the taste of anything you mix it with. So best just to mix it with water and drink as quick as possible. I wanted to take off a star for how gross it was, but if it’s meant to be that bad it’s not the products fault. I have tried other products from this brand and it seems to be high quality.
124. I hate all the artificial colors and flavors in Gatorade, so this is a great alternative. I followed the directions and mixed it with 8 oz of cold water and it was easy to dissolve and tasted like sugar water. Would probably taste better mixed with a little juice to give it some flavor for a child. But overall seems like a great product for all members of the family.
125. Generic brand of Vaseline. Seems to be identical to name brand. Multipurpose and handy to have on hand. I have tried one other product from Solimo, a spray sunscreen, and have been very happy with it. Seems to be a quality line of products.
126. My grandkids enjoyed this probiotic. I tried one and it’s has a very sweet fruit punch flavor that seems similar in texture and sweetness to a pixie stick.
127. Have a hole in your tooth from a crown falling out? It works.
128. Was it really necessary to use a photo for this product featuring a woman gleefully waving doughnuts at the camera?  I realize this is a product targeted to plus size women, but the doughnuts image  is stereotypical and offensive.  That being said, the product works well enough for what I wanted.  But please, just use a photo of a woman modeling the arm bands and lose the doughnuts.
129. I like it. Its smaller than most pill organizers, which I prefer since I only take a few pills. But honestly, it isnt worth more than $3-$4. Wait for the price to go down because even paying $5 for this, I thought I was overcharged. If you really love the aesthetic of the rainbow, go for it. But if you need more space for vitamins and pills, get something else.
130. Love this little thing.  I had a moldy smell in my bathroom.  Getting ready to renovate but until then bought this to help with smell and toxins.  After about 3 days the smell was completely gone.  Amazing.  Quiet little fan which is not annoying.
131. Good Product
132. I just received this item and I hadn't even tried it on, but I could tell from the feel of it I made an excellent choice. If you need a head strap for plastic frames that slide down your nose (as mine always do), get this product! It is even better than I had hoped: the strap is very lightweight, you won't even know you have it on. I wear behind-the-ear hearing aids -- the pieces that attach to my frames are very thin and pliable and fit nicely in my crowded ear space! The part that goes behind your head has a velcro fastener with the very cool company name on it. The strap sits low on my neck and is hardly noticeable, even with a shaved head. This strap is well worth your money and will do the job perfectly! The only available color is black -- I would have preferred some other -- but because of how well it works, I can easily overlook the matter. Order today!
133. Works very well and easy to use, good results
134. Excellent! Product. Fragrance Is Lovely & Only A Few Drops Are Needed In My Difusers To Scent My Large Rooms. Works Well With My Carrier Oil For Massage & Moisturizing My Skin, Fragrance Rises Mixed With Carrier Oil. This Is An Extremely Generous Size Bottle For The Stellar Price Point. Definitely My Go To Oil Now. Going To Stock My Gift Closet With It Also.
135. Beautiful Soft Bristle Brush w Reverse Massage Nubies. Great Color. Works As A Fantastic Soft Backscratcher (not advertised for this use), my personal discovery. Shalom! To All.
136. I used this after I dislocated my shoulder and double tore the labrum in my shoulder. This was great to make sure my shoulder didn't dislocate again and provided additional comfort and protection.
137. Quality is great......price is great!!!!  What more could one &#34;ask&#34;!!!!
138. Great make up remover. Smells nice.
139. Reminds you to stand up straight. No miracle but keeps you aware of your posture.
140. Great system helped me organize dad's pills for a month at a time.
141. Hard for me to remove from my finger. Seems to do a good job
142. It seems to work well but isn't comfortable enough and doesn't disappear under clothes. I think I'm wearing it right though; I followed all of the instructions. I ended up sticking it in a drawer and resolving to try again another time.
143. Gave you 12 year old granddaughter. She loves it.
144. Great for those who can't bend over well.
145. I love the colors and that we can store 4 batteries in each case and we can also attach them together. I think this is a great buy if you need to take batteries with you or simply store them organized.
146. Great idea, but NO instructions…such as length of time to microwave, ans Safety issues (container with steaming hot vinegar requires careful handling ane this unit is NOT stable…tophead will topple)
147. Best bug repellent, especially great on sensitive skin with a pleasant oder
148. I usually take biotin and ran out.Thought this would be the same  taking these.This has allot of other vitamins in it that I take separate, but the other vitamins In thisAre not strong enough ! Same problem with taking multi vitamins , allot but not enough!You have to take these for a while to notice if there working, as with most vitamins,  and these are pricey for 30 days.
149. Before I ordered these Omega 3 fish oil caps I wanted to check them out first to make sure these where a good high quality.Not from farm raised chemical farms.Sustainably sourced, wild caught,Not from a country with filthy water,  Not a bunch of unhealthy strange fish mixed in etc.This is wild Alaskan Pollock, that is as high in omega 3 as Wild Salmon.  This True Grace omega 3 came through higher then what I expected.The soft caps are easyTo swallow, no burping. .If you do not want a heart problem, and want to keep your brain sharp , you have to eat healthy, walk, and take these omega 3s.Eat allot of veggies, no processed food, less salt, organic, lite on the meat.It paid off for my hubby after two heart by passes, and not traveling and eating out anymore.5 stars.
150. I have a old electric Braun oral B tooth brush I was not using.Now I decided to recharge it and use it, but I thoughtMy older brushes were too stiff , so I ordered these as it says there soft!There just as hard as my old Braun tooth brushes, but these have smaller brushing area on Brussels.
151. This teeth whiting kit has everything in this , it’s complete.My husband is a coffee and tea drinker, even though we get our teeth cleaned ever4 to 5 months, ( we are older) He doesn’t like that his teeth are not as white as they should be.He has used this teeth whiting kit 3 times, and his teeth are looking whiter, althoughThis cannot get teeth as white as the dentist does.My teeth are very sensitive , and I won’t try this.
152. What a lovely presentation to give as a gift.That said I eat almost 100 % vegan, and not looking to lose weight, as thisSays it will keep you full.But I’m looking for eating healthy.MCT oil is healthy for your body, and I use it for my Salads with allot of seasonings.There is not any taste to this.Most people use this in there coffee, which I do not drink, andIn there Tea.  Although I do drink tea but I have not put this in it.But I do put this in a smoothie when I’m in a rush and don’t haveTime to eat.  Although I think smoothie are a waste as there is notAny fiber left in a smoothie there so parred.I do think this is pricey, and is clear that it should be.Comes in a nice Glass clear bottle that looks like  a bottle of vodka!
153. This DDgro back brace is made sturdy.It feels like there is 3 medal type of thin bars in the back, that are comfortable.I felt good wearing this , actually for my bad posture.My husband wears this when his back is sore, or doing some gardening, and lifting things.My husband wears jeans that are size 32 waist,  and I wear a size 8 or 10, this brace is a large, and a Medium would have been to tight for us.Hope this helps.
154. These DGL are different then the chewable have taken before.Truthfully when I ordered these I did not realize these are capsules,Although easy to take.That said , for me they did not help a strange indigestion I get, like theChewable do!
155. I live on a well for water, and get minerals in our water that gets a ring in our toilets even though IClean the toilets 3,4 times a week, and some bathrooms do not even get used.I have been using pumice stones for a long time .You get two in this  package, and they have thick plastic handles that have not broken with pressure.That said this white soft pumice is too soft for my toilet , and did not take offThe mineral ring as other gray pumice stones are harder and have easily taken the rings off.
156. This has D3 that is called the sun vitamin, and is it’s good for our bones.As we get older we do not absorb vitamins as good, and alsoThe sun. Although too much sun can cause Cancer of the skin.Before taking D3 you should get tested toActually know how much you need.I now need to take 10,000 mg of D3, and I Live in California andGarden everyday.The K2 mK7, and Mk2 in this takes the calcium fromYour arteries to your bones and teeth that keeps the calcium from cloggingUp your arteries, Although I likeThe K2-MK4 better, but that one is pretty Pricey.Now I notice there is K1 in this which surprises me!K1 clots your blood, and many people take a baby aspirinTo thin there blood a bit for there heart as they get older, so I feel that K1Would defeats the reason for taking a baby aspirin.If any one takes any type of a blood thinner they should Not take K1 at all,Or talk to your Dr. first.I’m only giving this a 2 stars cause of the K1 in this.
157. I like these Pacific gloves, there nicer then other gloves I have bought before.The gloves are very comfortable, not the heavy thick ones  that I have bought at the grocery store before, thatHave always been too big, clumsy,  and uncomfortable, and I usually would only use about 3 times and forget about them.These are a size medium, fit me, but the small would have been better, I have long thin fingers.The inside is soft and actually feels good.I use these Pacific gloves for doing the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, and washing my heavy cast iron pans.These gloves Get a good grip on heavy cookware.I also like the sleeves  are long, and the water does not run inside, and I use them for gardening.Good price for two utility gloves.
158. If you want something healthy this is it..I use the super Chlorella Powder when I make a smoothy in my vitamix.The taste of Chlorella is not the best to just drink it alone. I add organic frozen cherrys, part of a Apple, carrot, celery, bananaEven cabbage, and ice.I’m not a coffee drinker, but this drink gets me going in the morning, or a fast drink during the day.I really cannot find anything I do not like about this Chlorella powder..it’s organic, high in A& B-12,  cracked cells-easier to absorb,No wheat-no Gluten.
159. The boxes of Puffs came at a good time, as we are having allergies with a change of seasons..These are 2 ply. I’m use to a 3 ply tissue that is softer then these Puffs.These felt thin and rougher then what I’m use too, but when I used oneThey seemed a bit thicker then what I expected, but Not a full size tissue. Rather on the small side.These small boxes Would be nice next to a bed in the guest bathroom, nursery , car etc.If I had a cold this would not be the Tissue I would want to use. My husband was Not a fan of these.
160. Not only are these very helpful when you have a sick child with the flu etc.My husband had open heart surgery over a month ago, but when he came home from the hospital his electrolytesWhere still off.I mixed one of these with water, he drank it as his Dr. Told him too when he called him to say howAwful he was feeling. This mommy’s Bliss saved us a trip back to the hospital, but put my husband back on track to recovering.
161. Nice large 21oz. bottle of a body lotion I have not heard of before!The scent is Cherry Almond. The first scent I smelled when using this is Cherry, which is not my favorite.I like Almond better, but the scent does not last long.This is not a greasy lotion. It goes into my skin ,my legs and hands have been very dry, and my other lotionsWhere not helping much.But this Mountain Falls seems to help to soften my hands, and the do look better in a short time.I'm not a fan of some of the ingredients in this,  so I was surprised my hands do not look so old After using this a fewtimes a day.Came nicely packaged and no leaks, but The trouble I had with this bottle was getting the pump to come up ,soI could use this..not deducting for that.
162. We really like this mountain falls 30 Spf sun screen.Made in USA.Love the scent. Its fresh and clean. Seems to go in the skin, is not greasy. and  My skin does not feel dry after using this,as other SPF have left my skin feeling.Apply 15 mins before going out in the sun.If swimming,  reapply after 80 mins.We live on a river in California, and its hot and sunny here. I live on a river.I put this on 3 children .One is a red head, blue eyes, One child has platinum blonde hair, and fair.The children had on  tee shirts ,but using this they did notGet Sunburned around the neck or arms being in the river. A bit red yes, but Not sunburned.You can get sunburned through the window while driving.I put sunscreen on my hands for years, and have very little brown spots on my hands for my age.
163. Love them. They're easy to use just pull! Great product I will buy again!!
164. I think the frequency works for all pests. I don't hear sny more scratching near the attic above my bed, but I rarely used the night light and it turns on and then immediately off. I have bought 3 and it all does that so glad that the unit itself still works, perhaps an LED bulb for longetivity.
165. And it makes it cute
166. packaged well, great item for the price.  arrived promptly.
167. well packaged, arrived early. great price and smells lovely
168. This RAVELER SLEEP MASK (for Woman and Man, Contoured, with Ear Plugs) is good at blocking out light, but lets some light in at the nose area.  This is because the nose area is pre-shaped (like the nose area in a Halloween eye mask), so that the sleep mask doesn’t lie completely flat against the nose.Sleep masks designed with padded fabric across the lower edge of the mask (below the eyes and across the nose) do a more complete job of blocking out light (see, e.g., ).  However, this sleep mask, which comes with a set of rubber ear plugs, gives good value for the price (less than $6 on Amazon).  It also has a very wide and comfortable elastic band for holding the mask in place while you sleep.
169. This GERMGUARDIAN GG1000 PLUGGABLE UV-C SANITIZER AND DEODORIZER seems to be a “designer” model of the  that I’ve used successfully for a couple of years.  The pluggable Guardian air purifiers do remove most of the kitchen cooking odors (tiny grease globules in particular) that escape the “air guard” feature on my oven.This “shapely” air purifier runs more quietly than my rectangular version, though motor noise may be determined by the motor in individual devices.  (The motor was louder in my second rectangular device than it was in the first.)  The fans run constantly in these air purifiers, but they don’t seem to require a lot of electricity.The air purifier will operate in the up, down, or sideways position, so you don’t need to be concerned about the orientation of your household electrical outlets.  The purifier plug does NOT have a third prong for grounding, though it has wide and narrow prongs like most modern safety plugs.  The purifier covers only one outlet in a two-plug wall outlet, so the second outlet remains available for general use.My first pluggable GermGuardian lasted well beyond the one-year warranty period.  These little air purifiers don’t seem to require maintenance beyond replacing the UV bulb when it burns out (the blue light on the purifier will go out).  The bulbs are easy to replace, but you should NEVER look directly at a plugged-in UV bulb (with the purifier cover open), because this can permanently damage your eyes.
170. I love this voice-activated clock!  It's extremely easy to use, and lets me record daily or one-time reminders for absolutely everything (time to leave for an appointment, time to take medicine, time to turn off cooling fans after they've run for 30 minutes, etc.).  It speaks with a pleasing, polite female voice, and easily understands both male and female voice commands.  If there is moderate background noise, it may not understand some spoken commands, but muting the TV took care of this for me.The clock is very easy to set up.  You insert batteries (to hold your custom settings during power outages); plug the clock in; and use the manual setup ONCE to set the month, day, and year.  After that, you simply say "Reminder assistant".  The clock will respond, "What can I do for you?", and wait for you to answer with one of the 12 standard commands (for example, "What time is it?", "What day is it?", "Record reminder", "Play reminder", "Set alarm", "Snooze").  If you can't remember a phrase, you say "Help", and the clock will explain all of the commands.  To perform any function, all you need to do is follow the clock's voice prompts.You do have to use exact command phrases (which is why my clock is named "Jo", after the strict, do-it-by-the-book cop in the SyFy series "Eureka").  I would like to be able to record my own command phrases, but of course that would make the clock harder to set up, and would probably make it cost more, too.  You record reminder messages--anything that fits into six seconds--in your own voice, tell the clock the time for the reminder, and whether or not it is a one-time or recurring reminder.  At the assigned time, the clock plays your message, and repeats it until you say "Reminder off". Reminders apparently do not turn off until you issue a command--I tested one reminder for 10 minutes, and it did NOT turn off automatically.The clock's big, blue, digital display is very bright, even when set to "dim".  All of the clock functions can be performed manually, using buttons on the clock back--but it is rarely necessary to use manual commands.  There is an onoff switch on the clock back that controls the daily alarm clock, which I have set to permanent "off", because I use the clock for short-term reminders, and to keep track of the day of the week (it's easy to forget the day, when you work from home).For short-term reminders, I much prefer to use this clock instead of my Talking Timer (), because the Talking Timer has a distracting vocal minute-by-minute countdown for the last ten minutes (useful for cooking), and is a single-event timer.  The iTalk Reminder Assistant Voice-Activated Clock allows you to record up to ten reminders, which run simultaneously, and it simply plays your recorded reminder when "Time's Up!" (without any countdown).
171. Really horrible. I bought these instead of the Quest bars I usually eat, since they had several positive reviews. Have bitten into three flavors, and spit them all out. Nasty, sponge-like texture. All the 'flavors' are flavorless, just vaguely sweet. Protein bars are fuel, not indulgent, yummy food, but these are inedible. Will have to throw out the whole box.
172. Monoi smells awesome, but I can only smell if the air vents are blowing high. It's not a freshener that can be smelled when you enter a closed up vehicle... for the price, I wouldn't recommend or buy again
173. Tastes great and peps you up!
174. I've worked with putty with my therapist during hand therapy. This putty is no different except that I thought it was going to be so hard for me to use. It is actually not as hard as I expected it to be and is perfect for building strength in my hands. It is a bit oily but that is typical of the putty I used at my therapist office as well. I do feel, however, that the current price of $19.99 is very expensive for this small size.Note that this is good to keep an autistic child occupied. I have a friend with a severely autistic child (now adult), who uses these type of items to keep him busy and he is really into stuff like this.
175.  This is the 56th BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE- One BP unit- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet- One large cuff- One cloth carry pouch- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA BatteriesFEATURES- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.- The display is large.- Accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors.- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.NEGATIVES- The cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance.- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator. What happens is that after three readings, the first number displayed is the average. The next three numbers and beyond are the readings. Once I cycle through all the readings, the average is never displayed again unless I turn off the unit and then press the memory button again.- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.For those who are interested, I attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5-star monitors. These monitors I consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others I tested. I listed two 4-star monitors because they have unique features such as Spanish speaking or Bluetooth. Each one of these monitors is accurate and I would highly recommend any of them. – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. It does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. The arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people.  – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. Accuracy is spot on, which is atypical of wrist monitors.  – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case.

(4.5 stars) - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. The LCD Display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green, yellow, and red based on the hypertension level—which is EXCELLENT. There are two power options. It takes four AAA batteries or a USB Type C cable (both are included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in AMPM (not military time). The cuff size is large. There is an irregular heartbeat indicator. Accuracy is spot on.  – This is one unique monitor. The monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the iOS or Android app (viHealth). The cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small. Operation is simple. This is rechargeable and comes with the USB Type C cable for charging. There is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app. There is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app. In fact, the readings can be associated with multiple users (number and amount unknown). The date and time are automated through the Bluetooth pairing with the app. As of June 2022, the app is quirky and does not always connect. The BP unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone. The  is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulation(TENS) option. (Both are 4 stars) - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. The LCD Display is large and easy to read. There are two power options of either four AA batteries (NOT included) or a micro-USB cable (included). There is an average feature after two readings.

178. The current price of $9.99 for this ensemble is excellent and the mask alone is worth that price. However, if the price were more than $12.99, I would have rated this 2 or 3 stars due to the additional items included.This comes in a giftable box and includes a sleep mask, a silk eyeshade (like another mask), and disposable foam earplugs in a plastic case.I am very impressed with the foam mask. It is a cushiony soft, but full-bodied sleep mask. This mask has eye cutouts. There is also an adjustable strap in the back. Since there is an eye socket channel, I can open my eyes underneath without touching the front of it and it blocks out all light incredibly well. It feels like it is made of cloth covered form. It is comfortable to wear and fits me very well and is not too snug. It does not move around when I lay down with it. Overall, I really love the mask.However, the eye shade feels more like a lightweight silk mask. Even when I extend the adjustable strap all the way, it pulls tight around my eyes, is useless at blocking all light, and is supremely uncomfortable. The ear plugs are also just junk to me. They should leave out both items. I only took off one star because the mask is 5 stars. If they left out the other junk, I would have rated this 5 stars at the current price of $9.99.
179. For the current price of $44, I am  disappointed in this sleep mask. First of all, it is a gorgeous blue and that is the nicest thing about it. Also, it comes in a giftable package.I tried the mask and it barely works for me. The mask has some slight padding, which is nice and it is soft but not as soft as I expected. The adjustable strap is super thin and when I adjust it most of the way, it is still too tight around my eyes. Also, a tiny bit of light seeps in through the bottom of the mask.In summary, this mask is a gorgeous color and feels nice but the strap does not match what I expect to get for $44. It also is not completely light blocking. I personally do not feel  this mask should be priced more than $22.
180.  At the current price of $33.24 ($34.99 minus 5%), this is super expensive for something that can only be used as a nightlight. I was unable to pair this to any Bluetooth device and I tried a couple. Also, the touch controls are quirky, the timer goes off by itself with any button change, the light comes on automatically sometimes, and the pausemove ahead button is for show only as it does nothing. There are buttons on the front of the unit and on the bottom. It is impossible to read the bottom buttons. This is nice as a nightlight only and is barely functional as a sound machine with only 5 sounds. This is definitely not worth the current price for such a quirky and partially working sound machine.
181. There are three salt-infused 4-ply disposable face masks in this package at the current price of $9.49 and that is extremely expensive at $3.16 per disposable mask.These 4-ply masks look and feel like every other disposable blue mask I have tried previously and they supposedly work better due to the extra ply and the grains of Croatian sea salt.There is wire along the nose area so that I can mold this to my face. The pleats allow me to expand this until it is relatively snug under my chin and along the sides. The ear elastics fit nicely over my ears. Overall, these are comfortable for me. I personally notice no difference other than the mask is slightly thicker. I can only assume this is more protective.
182.  There are 12 individually wrapped smal bath bombs in this set. The fragrances are, orange, lavender, frankincense, rosemary, mint, lemongrass, vanilla, seasalt, kiwi, rose, coconut, and papaya.I tried the papaya. When it was first plunged into the water (see video) there was fizz and no suds. Before I could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet, the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later (see photo). Also, the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the package.Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I used this in a foot bath. The water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bath.In summary, these bombs perform terribly, are staining, and are barely fragrant in the bath. The current price of $19.99 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to $1.67 per bath bomb, which is about what I would expect to pay for bombs of this size. However, at that price, I also expect these to perform and they do not. These are super lackluster and an utter disappointment. I am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars. I doubt the other reviewers even tried this in the bath. In the box they look impressive but If they had used at least one, they most likely would not be so impressed.

There's an irregular heartbeat indicator.  The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried. – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. Unfortunately, it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. I love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most.   – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated only. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on.  – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor.  –  Super basic. Only stores 15 numbers in memory for one user without any date and time. There’s no case and it is battery operated only.  – This is good if storage for 4 family members is needed. It comes with a carrying case and it is battery operated only.  – The monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. Only a standard cuff is supplied & the cuff cable is short. The two power options available are 4 AA batteries or micro-USB (cable not supplied).  - The monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. There’s also an alarm feature. A larger-sized standard cuff is supplied but the cuff cable is short. The two power options available are 4 AA batteries or micro USB (neither is supplied). (3.5 stars) - This is a decent monitor with a large cuff so larger individuals can use it. It is only battery operated via 4 AAA batteries and only has one user mode with 99 memory points. The biggest negative is the European date and time. (3.5 stars) -This is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources (4 AAA batteries or AC cable), and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each. (4.5 stars) - The monitor is for 2 users w90 readings each. It has a large cuff and two power sources (4 AAA batteries or AC cable). The drawbacks are that I could not get the monitor to pair with the app with Bluetooth on and the angle of the display makes it difficult to read unless it is tilted back. Also, the time is only displayed as a 24-hour clock.  - The monitor is for 2 users w250 readings each. It has a large cuff with a cord that is just a tad shorter than other monitors I tried. There is one power source included (4 AAA batteries). There is also a connection for AC cord but that must be purchased separately. The LCD Display is large and easy to read.  – This monitor has two user modes w99 readings per user. The cuff is large, so most people will be able to use this. Two AAA batteries are the only power option. There is a speech option which is set by default. Time setting is military time only.  – This monitor has four user modes w240 readings per user.

184.  This is the 31st BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE- One BP unit- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet- One large cuff- One carry pouch- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA BatteriesFEATURES- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.- The display is large.- Accuracy is ERRs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable.- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.- The date and time settings are NOT remembered after the power is removed but the BP numbers are remembered  -- I tested after one minute of battery removal.- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.- It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.NEGATIVES- The accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5-star monitors.- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator.- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. The big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. There's an irregular heartbeat indicator.  The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried. – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. Unfortunately, it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. I love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most.   – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated only. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on.  – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor.  –  Super basic. Only stores 15 numbers in memory for one user without any date and time. There’s no case and it is battery operated only.  – This is good if storage for 4 family members is needed. It comes with a carrying case and it is battery operated only.  – The monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. Only a standard cuff is supplied & the cuff cable is short. The two power options available are 4 AA batteries or micro-USB (cable not supplied).  - The monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. There’s also an alarm feature. A larger-sized standard cuff is supplied but the cuff cable is short. The two power options available are 4 AA batteries or micro USB (neither is supplied). (3.5 stars) - This is a decent monitor with a large cuff so larger individuals can use it. It is only battery operated via 4 AAA batteries and only has one user mode with 99 memory points. The biggest negative is the European date and time. (3.5 stars) -This is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources (4 AAA batteries or AC cable), and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each. (4.5 stars) - The monitor is for 2 users w90 readings each. It has a large cuff and two power sources (4 AAA batteries or AC cable). The drawbacks are that I could not get the monitor to pair with the app with Bluetooth on and the angle of the display makes it difficult to read unless it is tilted back. Also, the time is only displayed as a 24-hour clock.  - The monitor is for 2 users w250 readings each. It has a large cuff with a cord that is just a tad shorter than other monitors I tried.

185. I was on the fence about ordering this. The reason I keep trying things is because I woke up many months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me before insurance denial prevented me from going back. He gave me an exercise to perform where I had to roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back. That helped some but then I ordered the below devices. - 4 stars - 5 stars - 4 stars - 4 stars - 4 stars - 2.5 starsTherefore, I decided to add this to my repertoire. Even though the above "devices" were good, my neck pain never went away and always came back either lightly or in full force every morning after waking up. Therefore,  I decided to try this because a heating pad on my neck sometimes helps.This neck brace comes with three extra Velcro strips, a USB power cord (no AC adapter), and a manual. Only one of the Velcro strips can be plugged in for heat. The others are just used as extensions or as a magnetic therapy pad (which I think is hocus pocus). The neck brace is segment, so that I should be able to  flare out the bottom lower on my neck if I want less support rather than more support.  I tried this and was unable to get this to flare out. I was only able to use this in the strong support mode.I plugged this into my computer's USB port while wearing it. There is a control that allows me to have high, medium, or low heat. The heat is nice but it is only in the area where the heated extension strip is and not around the entire neck. Also, I do not find this too comfortable to wear. I think this will work with some but for me this is not going to be useful. In summary, I do feel this might work for some people but it does not work for me. The heated area is too small and the brace too tall to be comfortable since I am unable to bring it lower on my neck. The current price of $25.99 would be reasonable for this had it worked for me.UPDATE: I had my boyfiend try this and he hates it. He say it only heats in the patch area, which is true. He gives this 1 star.
186. At the current price of $15.50 for 20 ounces of bath salts with a pouch of flowers, I do not feel this is worth it. I thought I would like the fragrance but I don't. Also, I have to put a strainer in my sink to prevent the flower buds from going down the drain.I bathed my feet for 20 minutes with about 12 cup of bath salts and some of the chamomile flowers. The results are no different than just plain Epsom Salt. The high price and my dislike of the fragrance would prevent me from ever ordering this again. It is okay but nothing special.
187. There are 14 lozenges in this package and the maximum "dosage" per day is 3 lozenges.  Each one contains 10 calories with 1g of added sugars, 1500IU of Vitamin D (as cholecalciferol--which is apparently D3 and animal based), 3mg of Zinc, 25mg Bee Propolis Extract, 12mg of Peppermint Extract, and 7.5mg of Eucalyptus Extract.Other ingredients in this are chicory root fiber, tapioca syrup, and honey.The current price of $8.99 comes to an expensive $.64 cents per dietary supplement drop. After having tried these, I personally do not like them enough to order them again. They are okay but I already take Vitamin D and these taste too medicinal for my tastebuds.
188. Simple instructions are provided but it is unclear of the correct positioning of the neck without looking at the photos on the Amazon site because the sketch in the instructions does not match the slope of this "pillow." Note that I have tried three other varieties of pillows and this is as good as the 5 star one listed below. The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is because the price is double what others charge. - 5 stars - 4 stars - 4 starsFor 10 minutes (one can go up to 15 minutes) I just wedged this under my neck with the open wave in the back of my head and let my head fall back. It is super comfortable to use. This actually works for me to help but not eliminate my neck pain.I woke up many months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me a similar exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back.Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is firm yet soft enough in the center to be comfortable which is better for alignment. It works great and did not  take any getting used to like the foam device I have. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neckhead hangs over this. I am able to do this for 10 minutes.In summary, this works for me but the current price of $49.95 is extremely expensive for this. Had it been $29 or less, this would have received 5 stars. I just wish it came with better pictures in the instructions.
189. This is the 26th BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and it is an decent monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one operates within 5 to 8 points plus or minus from my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 99 readings per user. Note that I did not take 198 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. What is excellent is that the display is color coded. A green backlight means the pressure is normal or low depending on the numbers displayed, an orangeyellow background indicates mild hypertension, and a red background indicates severe hypertension. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings. There is one large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There are two power options supplied and that is via the supplied micro-USB cable (an AC adapter was not included) or via four AA batteries that are NOT included. Time settings are in 12 or 24-hour clock.INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE- One BP unit- One BP User Manual- One User Guide- One large cuff- One micro-USB cable- One thin carry pouchFEATURES- Up to 99 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.- Date and time settings are available.- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading and having the color-coded display is great.- The cuff is 22 to 40 cm (8.66 to 15.748 inches).- The user guide is decent.- Accuracy is good and compares with the BP range taken on my two 5-star gold standard monitors.- Switching user modes is easy by pressing SET (when power is off) and then SET again to switch to the other user.- It displays an average after three readings.- The date and time settings are remembered after power is removed. I tested this for one.NEGATIVES- The reading has a backlight that goes out too quickly. I would have preferred it stayed lit a few more seconds.- The memory delete does not work as specified in the manual. It needs to say that when the display is off, press the MEM button until a BP reading is displayed, then while holding down the button, press the STARTSTOP for two seconds until the dotted lines appear.This is a decent BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is very simple and was explained well in the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.In summary, this BP monitor displayed numbers within a 5-to-8-point range (+ or -) of my two go to monitors.  Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is super easy but is not as written in the manual. The cuff is large enough for most individuals, although it is about one inch smaller than most large cuffs. The LCD Display is large and the color-coding is good to have but the display lights go out quickly, which is a negative. It displays an AVG after three readings, which is a plus. The current price of $29.99 is reasonable for this monitor.For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried. – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. Unfortunately, it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. I love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most.   – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated only. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on.  – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor.  –  Super basic. Only stores 15 numbers in memory for one user without any date and time. There’s no case and it is battery operated only.  – This is good if storage for 4 family members is needed. It comes with a carrying case and it is battery operated only.  – The monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. Only a standard cuff is supplied & the cuff cable is short. The two power options available are 4 AA batteries or micro-USB (cable not supplied).  - The monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. There’s also an alarm feature. A larger-sized standard cuff is supplied but the cuff cable is short. The two power options available are 4 AA batteries or micro USB (neither is supplied). (3.5 stars) - This is a decent monitor with a large cuff so larger individuals can use it. It is only battery operated via 4AAA batteries and only has one user mode with 99 memory points. The biggest negative is the European date and time. (3.5 stars) -This is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources (4 AAA batteries or AC cable), and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each. (4.5 stars) - The monitor is for 2 users w90 readings each. It has a large cuff and two power sources (4 AAA batteries or AC cable). The drawbacks are that I could not get the monitor to pair with the app with Bluetooth on and the angle of the display makes it difficult to read unless it is tilted back. Also, the time is only displayed as a 24-hour clock.  - The monitor is for 2 users w250 readings each. It has a large cuff with a cord that is just a tad shorter than other monitors I tried. There is one power source included (4 AAA batteries). There is also a connection for AC cord but that must be purchased separately. The LCD Display is large and easy to read.  – This monitor has two user modes w99 readings per user. The cuff is large, so most people will be able to use this. Two AAA batteries are the only power option. There is a speech option which is set by default. Time setting is military time only.  – This monitor has four user modes w240 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AA batteries or AC adapter – both supplied. It has a seven-day AMPM average feature in addition to the regular average feature. Smart app does not work and keeps crashing.  – This monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AAA batteries (not included) or AC adapter (included). It has a regular BP average feature. The display is large for easy reading.  – This monitor has two user modes with 60 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by the two included AAA batteries. The LED is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. Unfortunately, the BP is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) mostly due to the unitcuff design that does not allow for a secure fit.  The respiration number is accurate, however.   – This monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AAA batteries (included) or included USB cable (no AC adapter). The display is large for easy reading. Time is in military time only (24-hour clock). The cuff inflation is so strong that this is the most uncomfortable monitor I ever tried. It caused my arm to go numb and left a mark and pain for hours.  - This monitor has two user modes with 99 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by two AAA batteries, NOT INCLUDED. The LED is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. There’s also a voice assist option. Unfortunately, the BP is around 10 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure). The closer the user holds the arm to heart level, the less the inaccuracy but it is still not as good as the gold standard.  The respiration number is accurate, however.  – This monitor has two user modes with 120 readings per user. This monitor is very basic as it does not have an average or irregular heartbeat feature. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AAA batteries (included) or included USB cable (no AC adapter). The display is large for easy reading. Time is in military time only (24-hour clock). There’s voice guidance. - This monitor did not work at all and kept displaying ERR4 indicating there is a cuff problem. As an FYI only, this has two user modes with 99 readings per user. After three readings it provides an average. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AAA batteries (included) or included USB cable (no AC adapter). The display is large for easy reading. Time is both in 12 and 24-hour clock. (1 star) - This monitor holds a total of 240 readings if using all two user modes. Operation is via 4 AAA batteries but the ones included were DEAD. The other power option is via a 6V adapter that is not included. The manual is comprehensive and clear. The cuff is large enough for most individuals. The LCD Display is large and easy to read. The readings are extremely accurate. Time is in military time only. This is a great basic monitor and would have received 5 stars if it were not for the DEAD batteries.  - This monitor holds a total of 240 readings if using all two user modes. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator. There is one very large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There is one power option supplied (two available but a USB cable was not included) and that is via four AAA batteries. The LCD Display is large and easy to read. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock only (a.k.a. military time). The biggest negative is that it does NOT have an AVERAGE feature for the BP readings like other monitors do.  This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. There is one very large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There are two power options supplied, either via USB cable or via four AAA batteries. The LCD Display is large and easy to read. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock only (a.k.a. military time). The biggest negative is that it does NOT have an AVERAGE feature for the BP readings like other monitors do. It is also very basic and does not have an irregular heartbeat indicator.  This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. There is one very large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There are two power options supplied, either via USB cable (included) or via four AA batteries (not included). The LCD Display is large but sometimes not easy to read due to haze of other numbers. Time settings are available in 12 or 24-hour clock. The numbers are AVERAGED after two reads. BP takes a long time to register, so this is not a fast reader. Voice option is available.  - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. There is one very large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There are two power options supplied, either via a Type C USB cable (included) or via four AAA batteries (included). The LCD Display is large and easy to read and color coded in orange, green, and red based on the hypertension level—which is EXCELLENT.  Time settings are in the 24-hour clock only (a.k.a. military time). The numbers are averaged after three BP and it has an irregular heartbeat indicator. (4.5 stars) – This wrist monitor is cheap junk. It holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. It has a large display and takes two AAA batteries NOT included. There is an average feature and irregular heartbeat indicator. The manual is incomplete. Accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors and this monitor would have received 4 stars had it not been for the cheap faceplate which falls off repeatedly because it is only taped on. There is a speech option which is set by default but can be turned off. There are NO date or time settings. 
190. There are five super sturdy, tiny boxes in this set that will hold a small bar of soap or some jewelry. The front flap magnetically closes.Box setup is simple. Just unfold the one piece into the shape shown in less than a couple of seconds. There are no ugly creases; just a sturdy box. The four corners can be sealed shut by removing the paper over the adhesive. When I have done that in the past, I find that the adhesive is not strong enough to stick well.The reason I rated these two stars is because the corners that are sealed (not the ones I can seal) come undone as can be seen in my photo. This means I have to glue the corners that are supposed to arrive sealed already.The current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for a box that is coming apart at the seams. If the boxes were not coming apart, I would have rated them 4 stars.
191.  This sound machine comes with a total of 28 sounds; 18 are under the white noise button and 12 are under the lullaby button. This is a plug-in unit and comes with a USB cable but no AC adapter, the unit itself, and a regular instruction pamphlet.Operation is simple as per my video. All the controls are on the top front of the unit. I have to "hold press" the ONOFF button to turn it ON and do the same to turn it OFF.There are seven operational buttons on the top. The timer can be set for 30, 60, or 90 minutes or turned off for continuous play. The unit can be used as a nightlight only or with the sound.Most of the sounds are crisp but a couple are a bit staticky and that is the reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.The current price of $23.39 ($25.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced.
192. This case is super attractive and holds a total 27 of my Vitamin E 2000 IU capsules. If I could remove the insert, it would hold a few more.LOVES- Love the the design and that there is a different embossing on the top and bottom so I can tell which end is up- Love that it is small enough to be portable- The clasp is super sturdy, so it will not come undone in my purseDISLIKES- I wish the insert were removableIn summary, this case is really sturdy and super attractive. It will only hold a few horse-sized pills but it is great for those who have smaller pills to carry. Also the clasp is very sturdy.  The current price of $9.99 is competitive for this.
193. Usually I am disappointed with the various exercise  therapy devices on the market. However, this actually works for me.I woke up several months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me the exact same exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back.Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is harder which is better for alignment. There are three adjustment levels based on the blocks used. I use it on the lowest setting, which is with the two bottom blocks removed. It works great but does take some getting used to. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neckhead hangs over this. I am able to do this for 5 minutes. Eventually, I'll work up to 10 minutes.In summary, this works for me. I love the adjustment levels available and the ease with which this can be used.UPDATE - After trying  device, I actually like that better than this one. This is not as comfortable as the new device I am trying; therefore, I lowered this one star.
194.  There are 6 individually wrapped large bath bombs in this set in the shape of pastry shop delectables. Each bath bomb is fragrant but smells the same to me.I tried the one with the plastic rainbow on top. I had to be careful that the rainbow did not wash down the drain. The fragrance came through in the foot bath. The bomb dissolved in about 10 minutes. The performance was good with suds that lasted about 10 to 12 minutes. The end result of the bath was almost clear water that was a bright pink. There was no staining to my skin, my towel, or to my foot bath; at least the color of the one I tried did not stain.The current cost of $13.76 ($15.29 minus 10%) for 6 bombs comes to a competitively priced $2.29 per pastry bomb. These are nice bombs and definitely giftable. Performance is good enough and they are very fragrant.
195.  I had tried  bath bombs, which are the same as these but in a smaller size. Unfortunately, this large size performs slightly differently as I'll describe below.There are 3 super large individually wrapped bath bombs in this set. All are large clouds with a smiley face on the package covering.Each one is strongly fragrant when dry and lightly fragrant when in the bath. They also all have the same scent. The ingredients are sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, magnesium sulfate, water, cyclodextrin, PEG400, hydrogenated jojoba oil, hydrogenated grapeseed oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) oil, natural essential oil, fragrance, and FDA approved colorants.These are very, very large and fun. They perform well, produce a lovely rainbow of suds, and dissolve in about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is subtle in the bath. However, there is one difference in the results (read on).Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. When I was done, the color did not adhere to my foot bath but it turned both my feet pink and  my drying towel. Note that the smaller bombs did not do this even though they are the same. Perhaps it is the extra profusion of color in such a large size. This is the only reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.The current cost of $ 19.99 for 3 bombs comes to a very expensive $6.66 per bomb. However, these are certainly way different from typical bath bombs. I like these very much but would have loved them if it did not color my feet and towels. Note that the color does wash off the towels in the laundry and in the shower for my feet.
196. There is one very large and super soft mask in this package along with one small cloth carry pouch. This mask is well-made and has a Velcro adjustment in the back. Since the mask is large, it blocks out all light. However, I am still able to open my eyes underneath the mask and not see anything. This is just wonderful and is very comfortable to wear. The quality is excellent and the mask is plush and cuddly soft.The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) is pricey for one mask; however, if one is in the market for two of them, they are sold for a much cheaper price . Also, the blue color on the Amazon site is brighter than the one received which is more of a subdued blue.
197.  These green tea and chamomile bath salts have a lovely but subtle fragrance. I used this in my foot bath and found it soothing. The only difference to me between this and Epsom salt is that this has a fragrance and typical Epsom salts do not. However, some of today's Epsom salts have fragrances but they are not as good as this.The package says to pour 14 salt into the bath water but it doesn't say if it is 14 of the container or 14 cup. Some reviewers used 14 cup and others 14 of the container. They need to specify this. I used 14 cup. The crystals dissolved after about 10 minutes.The current price of $15.99 is pricey for this but then again it is almost like a spa-like experience.
198. There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set and they all smell the same to me. The box is wrapped around the center in packaging tape which looks hideous. The bombs themselves, however, are presentation quality in the sense that they are wrapped in tissue paper and then also shrink wrapped in plastic under that.I hardly detected any fragrance with these and they all smell the same to me. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I test them in a foot bath first to either bathe my hands or my feet. Because I was skeptical of these, I bathed my hands.One bath bomb dissolves in about three minutes in close to hot water and the suds last about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is almost non-existent and the results are horrendous. First of all, as I was filling the foot bath, the color of the bombs sprayed all over my sink and kitchen backsplash just as a result of running water over the bomb. I had about five minutes of cleaning to do from that. However, after bathing my hands, they came out pink as can be seen in the photo and I was unable to wash the color off with soap and water. These are a complete disappointment.I would not recommend these at all only because of the color staining of these bombs, the limited fragrance, and the way the box is wrapped.
199.  This sound machine comes with a total of 36 sounds (i.e. 6 each of fan, white noise, nature, ocean, tones like rain and thunderstorm, and hypnotic sounds). This is NOT battery operated. It is packaged with a USB cable, the unit itself, and a regular instruction pamphlet.Operation is simple as per my video. All the controls, except for the timer slider and light, are in the front of the unit. I have to "hold press" the ON  OFF button in the front to turn it ON and do the same to turn it OFF.There are 6 operational buttons  on the front. From left to right, the down arrow moves to the next sound mode, the broken circle cycles through the sound in the current sound mode. The ONOFF button is in the center and then the minus (decrease) and plus (increase) buttons control the volume.A tap on the top of the unit turns on the nightlight. There are three  states of light on, light absorption (breathing light), and light off. If I "press hold" it will change the brightness. Despite what I said in my video, I discovered that if I lightly press the ONOFF button while the sounds are playing, it will suspend the current sound and I will be able to operate this as a nightlight only without the sounds. I did not think I could do that.The timer slider in the back has only a 30 or 60 minute option or continuous running mode. There is also a headphone jack on the back to the right of the port of the USB cable.In summary, the sounds on this unit are crisp and clear. It has a larger selection than many units on the market. The nightlight is a nice touch but I wish they had colored lights and I wish this was battery operated. No AC adapter is included for the USB cable but most people will have one in their house.  The current price of $27.99 is competitively priced for this. Know that there will never be more than 36 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds, only a few of them will ever be played. I am partial to the sounds of nature myself.
200. I use essential oils in my diffusers and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect for that. This is also great for those who make body butters or other lotions.The fragrance is  clean and masculine and smells like a good soap. I use anywhere from 3 - 5 drops in my diffuser depending on the size of my water reservoir. The resulting aroma is lovely.The current price of $15.99 for this large 3.38 fluid ounce bottle is reasonable as it comes to less than $5 per ounce.
201. I tried several brushes over the last several months but this one is the best so far. This is now my favorite brush. The handle looks exquisitely crafted even though it is probably machine made. I also have this brush in the darker color wood that I use in the shower as a back brush with soap and it is great.The brush is hefty and is one solid piece, which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. The handle of this back brush has indentation grips on it which provides me with a good hold. The handle is also long, which provides me with a good reach.The brush head is sturdy enough to be exfoliating and cleaning yet gentle enough not to be irritating. I love that there is a rope at the end for hanging in the shower and there is even a canvas bag for storage after air drying if desired.Overall, I love this as a wet brush for my back. I do not use this for dry brushing. The current price of $21.80 is about twice what most wooden back brushes go for but the quality is also higher but it's cheaper than their darker wood version that sells for $24.86 which is $3.06 more than this lighter colored one.PS The Smiley Smith engraving with what looks like a monkey is cool too.
202. This mask is well-made and I love the burgundy and black color. The mask has a Velcro adjustment in back and padded eye cups to block out all light. The eye cups allow my eyes to open underneath the mask. This feels comfortable to wear. The quality is good but the mask itself is not as plush and cuddly soft like some others I tried.The current price of $9.79 ($13.99 minus 30%) is super reasonable for this mask.
203. These lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck but they can only be hooked onto masks that have a very thin elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end. The cord is sufficiently long and can be cinched tighter or looser around the neck if needed. I felt it was roomy enough cinched partway down.The chains are colorful and work well. The current price of $5.99 is excellent for this as it comes to $1.20 per lanyard. I really like fun color of these chains; however, my absolute favorite mask chain is , which is more than 12 times the price but is also an eyeglass chain, jewelry, and a mask holder.
204. For the current price of $3.99 this is an excellent foot file. If it were priced higher, I would have rated this 4 stars because it is small. In order to use this, I have to hold this in my right hand like a computer mouse by grasping the outside and placing my forefinger in the center. This works gently but effectively on the dry skin on my heels. If held correctly, this file is relatively easy to hold  and easy to work with. Some files are like cheese graters and this one is gentler. When I am done, I just rinse the business end under warm water and the dead skin that was removed easily rinses off. The file looked brand new afterward.Due to the small size, this is a few dollars cheaper than other etched glass (a.k.a. nano crystal) files on the market, which is great. In addition, this is a gorgeous file in a pretty color. To me it's  functional art.
205. I am always looking for inserts with good arch support to help alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. Usually I am disappointed in the orthotics on the market. However, this insert is wonderful. It has the right balance of firmness and pliability which makes it feel cushiony without being overly soft or overly hard. It also has a high arch that is very supportive for someone like me who has plantar fasciitis.I take at 9 to 9.5 in shoes and sometimes a 10 depending on the cut. Therefore, I ordered this in that woman's size. I use these in my boot-like slippers and I feel like I am walking on air.The current price of $17.84 ($20.99 minus 15%) is competitively priced for an arch support of this quality and support. They are thick, comfortable, and perfect for me. I absolutely adore these.
206. There are a total of 100 bandages in this set. There are two boxes of 50 bandages each and each box contains 26 knuckle and 24 fingertip bandages.These stick pretty well and flex with the movement of my hands. They are also breathable. These are very strong cloth bandages and perfect for those who are always scraping their knuckles or cutting their fingers.The current price of $14.15 ($14.89 minus 5%) comes to $.14 cents per bandage.
207. I tried one of their shower steamers yesterday and was not impressed. There are eight steamers in this package. Each tablet is the size of a hockey puck but half the size. The tablet needs to be  elevated in the shower so that the steam and water droplets hit it. The one I tried slowly dissolved and fizzed and leaked an electric pink color all over my tub that (thankfully) washed away with little effort.I have the nose of a bloodhound and I could barely detect any scent. I then decided to dissolve it in the bottom of my shower as if it were a bath bomb. I still barely detected a fragrance. Why anyone would use something like this is beyond me, especially when very little fragrance is present. I already wash my hair and soap up my body with very fragrant shampoo and bath soap, so there is no need for a steamer in my shower.Nevertheless, I spent several minutes dissolving the tablet in the shower after I finished washing and there was still very little scent.  These are not for me. However, I do feel they would be more effective as bath bombs because they fizz and one will be closer to the action to get more of the scent.At the current price of $11.99 for eight tablets, this comes to a  $1.50 per steamer.
208. This is the first time I ever tried a shower steamer and I am not impressed. There are six steamers in this package. Each tablet is the size of a hockey puck but half the size. I elevated this tablet in the shower and let the steam and water droplets hit it. It slowly dissolved and fizzed and leaked an electric pink color all over my tub that (thankfully) washed away with little effort.I have the nose of a bloodhound and I could barely detect any scent. I then decided to dissolve this in the bottom of my shower as if it were a bath bomb. I still barely detected a fragrance. Why anyone would use something like this is beyond me, especially when very little fragrance is present. I already wash my hair and soap up my body with very fragrant shampoo and bath soap, so there is no need for a steamer in my shower.Nevertheless, I spent several minutes dissolving this in the shower after I finished washing and there was still very little scent.  These are not for me. However, I do feel they would be more effective as bath bombs because they fizz and one will be closer to the action to get more of the scent.At the current price of $9.99 for six tablets, this comes to a slightly pricey $1.67 per steamer.
209.  This is an attractive and giftable set of six bath bombs. The Amazon site says the four fragrances are Lavender, Vanilla, Rose, and Orange but it was hard for me to detect those aromas. They all smell nice  but the fragrance difference is super subtle. They are made with essential oils.I tried the greenishbluishyellow bomb in my foot bath. I used hot to tepid water and suds were created in the foot bath and the bomb fizzed as shown in the video. It eventually (in about 10 minutes) dissolved in the water as I bathed my feet. My feet felt clean and I liked the subtle scent. My feet also came out feeling  soft. Unfortunately, there was a slight adherence of the green color of the bomb to my ankles and heels but it was ever so slight. A white bathtub might develop a slight ring of color around it from these bombs but I suspect it would immediately wash off. Insofar as "performance," these bombs are really good. Luckily I had a strainer in my sink because I had no idea there was a surprise miniature animal figurine in these. I had a little dinosaur in mine. Although no price is listed, I suspect these will be priced between $16.99 and 18.99.
210. I use a back brush every day. This body brush works well. It has a small brush head that is of medium softness so it is mildly exfoliating. The handle is long enough for me to reach my back comfortably. I also like that it has a hole for a hook in the handle.The current price of $6.99 is on the high side of competitively priced for a brush of this calibre.
211. I love the portability of the individual days of this "pill case attache." It is great for 2x's per day doses. However, I have a few dislikes.LOVES- Each day is portable.- Each side is large enough to hold about10 pills (as long as they are not super large)- I find it easy to fill- The PU carrying case makes the pill compartments easy to carry. DISLIKES:- The pill cases are tightly enclosed in the case making it a bit difficult to remove each day.- There is no AM PM written on each cell; instead there is a moon and sun.- The days written on the side of the case are only one one side. Since the cells move around in the case, the day of the week is not always visible.In summary, even though this is large, I like that each circular day container can be taken in a purse for one day and there is no need to take the entire container. They also hold a sufficient amount of pills for me. Unfortunately my dislikes have me rating this case 3 stars. The current price of $10.99 is reasonable for this and a lot cheaper than the same case in black that is $5 more by another vendor.
212. There are 30 shiny gold boxes that are perfect for Christmas gifts, cookies, cupcakes, or other classy but lightweight gifts. They come in one piece and unfold easily into a reasonably-sized box. The bottom is interlocking and just unfolds easily into place. Each box should be able to fit about one to two pounds of cookies depending on the size of the cookie. I can even get an appropriately-sized tiny cake in this box. Overall, I think these are classy and well-made but they are thinner than I expected. Therefore, these are for lightweight items only. Also, I would recommend using tissue paper or foil on the bottom before using to carry treats to stabilize the box a bit. The current price of $17.99 is competitive as it comes to $.60 cents each box.
213.  There are 6 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set in the scents listed below.- Romance - La Vie en Rose- Optimism - Orange Juice- Happiness - Lemon Tree- Confidence - Grapefruit Punch- Acuity - Chocolate Mint- Tranquility - Purple LavenderEach fragrance is divine, smells fresh, and all the scents are different but they are only subtly different. These bombs are made with essential oils and they are large. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. One bath bomb dissolves in about five minutes in close to hot water. The fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening. I also love that the color did not adhere to my skin or to my foot bath; at least the color of the "Romance" bomb I tried did not adhere.The current price of $17.99 comes to $3 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again I feel these are better than most. This would make a wonderful gift.
214.  This sound machine comes with a total of 24 sounds. It is packaged with an AC adapter, the unit itself, a cheat sheet circle, and a regular instruction pamphlet.Operation is simple as per my video. I just plugged it in and then pressed the light button for my choice of nightlight color. I also pressed the sound playing button to start playing the sounds. This button serves as the onoff button for the unit. The nightlight feature has seven lights that can be cycled through with two variations of white light. The timer feature goes from 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously. There are three sound controls - naturelullaby, white noise, and fan. There are 8 available sounds each for the white noise and fan and 16 nature sounds. I particularly like the nature sounds.The current price of $25.99  is what machines like this go for. Of course, in the days of smart home speakers such as Google Home, no such device is really needed as I can just ask my Google Home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine. Nevertheless, for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves, this does work. Know that there will never be more than 24 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds, only a few of them will ever be played.I rated this unit three stars for several reasons. First, I prefer a battery operated unit (correction to what I said in my video). I do not like the idea that I have to be tethered to a power supply to operate this and want to be able to take it with me anywhere. Second, the controls on top are very difficult to see (see photo). The printing needs to be a bright white so that it is visible to the operator. Third, the unit is not as sleek as some other units I tried previously--it's tall and squat. Nevertheless, this works as designed and it is a good machine, but this is not my top pick.
215. I misunderstood what these were. I thought they were pre-moistened disposable wipes. However, these are DRY wipes that have to be wet. They are very strong and remind me of an everlasting paper towel. The problem is that I use paper towels or wet wipes to clean that are more disposable and can be thrown away after the initial use. I feel bad throwing these away and am not too keen on rinsing out litter pan gravel, lots of dust, and floor debris down the drain in order to reuse these.As can be seen in my photos, I used this to clean up litter pan dust. For this test, I did rinse it out and reused it again. I actually felt guilty throwing away the one wipe I used because it really is not very disposable.Obviously these have a purpose in situations where one wants to use a wipe like a rag that gets reused over and over again. For those purposes, these are perfect. However, I have an aversion to rinsing dust, debris, and grease down the drain and prefer to use paper towels instead. Therefore, I might re-purpose these to wash my dishes instead of using the cloth Handi Wipes.I was thinking these might work in a kennel but who wants to wash the wipe and re-use it after picking up animal waste and stuff. Currently there is no price listed but I suspect these will be costly.UPDATE - I've been using these for six months now and each wipe lasts me two weeks. It will take me forever to use all 300. I use them to clean my sink and wipe down my countertops several times per day. As as a result, I raised my ranking from 3 to 5 stars simply because they last very long.
216. To me there is nothing like a full mesh body puff. It is the only thing I use in the shower outside of a back brush. Nevertheless, these mitts have the best of two worlds. The mesh is thin and sewn onto the glove. The glove has two finger holes for the thumb depending on which side is being used. If I want a sudsy wash, I pull this on like a glove and use the mesh side. If I want to exfoliate, I turn it over and use the rough side. It also has a loop for hanging.It does not replace my favorite shower sponge but this comes close. Also, these can be used to wash the dishes if one does not want to use them for the shower.The current price of $13.98 comes to an expensive $6.99 per mitt.
217. This essential oil is a blend of sweet orange, neroli, and thyme. The combination evolves into a delicious orange aroma. I use about four to five drops in each of my diffusers and the fragrance wafts through the entire room. It is lovely.The current price of $9.99 is expensive for .17 fluid ounces; however, since I like the aroma so much, I did not take off one star for the high price.
218. There are two slim-profile six-cell travel-sized pill cases in this package along with 54 labels. Each of the cells has a good clasp that snaps tightly shut. In my photo, I was able to fit 20 of my 50mcg D3 tablets into one cell. Their portability and slim-profile are the best features. Note that it will not store more than a couple of  "horse-sized" pills and may not be able to store any depending on the size of the capsule. The cell covers do not fully stay open when removing or inserting the pills, so be prepared for it to stay only partially open.Also note that there is a right way and wrong way to insert the case into its holder. The side with the finger nubs on the case is the correct face-up position to insert the pill case with the lids facing up. It does not go in correctly if the case is flipped.The current price of $8.99 is competitively priced as it comes to $4 per case.
219. There are three roll-on fragrances in this set of Real Love, Citrus Glow, and Frankincense. I love the Citrus Glow as it has a full-bodied orange aroma. The Frankincense is my next favorite, followed by Real Love which is my least favorite. I cannot describe the scents of the other two.I applied each to the inside of my wrists. Unfortunately, the fragrance does not last long at all (about one hour). The current price of $24.99 would be competitive if these lasted longer and if I liked all three scents. The citrus one is my only favorite.
220. This is an excellent set for smoothing calluses or cracked heels. It comes with the rechargeable wand, a USB cable, three pumice heads, a cleaning brush, two foot masks, and two toe separators. I do not care for the toe separators because they hurt and are thick. However, everything else is great. Per the Amazon site, the grinding heads are coarse, regular, and fine.There are two speeds (slow and fast) and a tiny light on the front. The power level is also displayed during use. Operation is super simple. Just make sure the desired grinding head is fully seated and then press the ONOFF button. Press again if the fastest speed is desired. Press a third time to turn off.I did find the grinding a bit ticklish but was able to get through it. This is definitely a keeper. The current price of $12.99 is also excellent for this. Note that the grinding heads can be rinsed under water.
221. This mask is excellent. It has a nose wire and internal pocket for the supplied filters. The ear loops are adjustable with the silicone adjuster; however, they can fall off if adjusted too much. A lanyard would prevent them from falling off.There are two thick filters supplied as well.  The only big negative with this mask is that the medium adult size is more like a kid-size mask. I usually take a medium in a mask as I find the large is too loose. However, with this mask, I should have picked a large.The $19.99 price tag is also too expensive for this. If the sizing were right, it would have gotten 4 stars from me. If both the sizing and price were right (about $10), then it would have received 5 stars.
222.  This is a white noise sound machine with a total of 6 sounds. It "sits up" like an alarm clock. I love that it is battery operated. I charged it overnight. This comes with a USB cable (not the typical micro USB; perhaps type C), the unit itself, and an instruction pamphlet. Operation is simple as per my video. Press and hold the onoff button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off.  Rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, and bonfire. All but one sound is pure annoying noise.The timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes. Each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off, it means the timer is off.There is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on. The nightlight button is in the center top. There are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light.  The first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial. The second press turns on one side of dots, then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off. The next press keeps all the dots lit. This is what they call breathing lights.The volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volume.The current price of $16.19 ($26.99 minus 40%) would be extremely reasonable for this if I liked it but I do not. It has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights. I like the look of this and that it is battery operated. I also like the simple operation. However, the two most important features (nightlight and sound) are lackluster in my opinion.
223. I tried several brushes over the last several months and love the KOZIS Wooden Bath Brush (Amazon item # B08HR2GBHC) the best. However, this one is very good too.The brush head side is ample for good coverage. The bristles are of medium softness. The massaging side is not useful to me because I have no desire to use that. In fact, I do not even understand why anyone would use that. The brush is hefty and is one solid piece, which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower. In addition, a self-stick hook is supplied if needed but I did not use it.Besides the massaging brush head that I find useless, the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than I would like. Many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back. Nevertheless, this is still very functional and it is very well made.Overall, I like this brush even though it comes in second to the KOZIS I love. The current price of $11.99 is about right for a two-sided wooden brush.
224. This brush is two-sided. The only thing I like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back. However, I would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puff.The other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and I have to stretch to reach my entire back. In addition, the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing. Why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me. There is already a hole in the handle for hanging.A self-adhesive hook is provided for hanging although I did not use that.In summary, this is functional but is the least favorite back washer I tried so far. Also, the current price of $14.99 is outrageous for this.
225.  This is a nice white noise sound machine with a total of 16 sounds. It is not battery operated and comes with a USB cable but no AC adapter, the unit itself, a round instruction card, and a regular instruction pamphlet.The unit must be plugged in to operate.  Operation is simple as per my video. There is a nightlight feature where several lights can be cycled through. The timer feature goes from 15 to 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously by holding the button down. The play button will turn the unit sound on or off. There are three sound controls - nature, white noise, and lullaby. There are six available sounds for the first two and only four lullaby sounds.The current price of $23.99 is reasonable for this. Of course, in the days of smart home speakers such as Google Home, no such device is really needed as I can just ask my Google Home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine. Nevertheless, for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves, this does work. Know that there will never be more than 16 sounds available and it always has to be plugged in to operate.PS - I was almost going to lower the rating of this unit by one star because there was a card insert with the unit saying that $10 will be provided for a positive review. Such unethical practices annoy me. This unit is good enough to stand on its own merits without having to buy a review and if it were not, then it would not deserve a positive review.
226. I love the Heeta brand as I have a detangling brush of theirs that is excellent. Therefore, when I saw these I just had to try them. There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set in the scents listed below. - lavender- orange- lemon- strawberry- peppermint- coconut- vanilla- grapefruit- ocean- rose- blueberry- mango  Each fragrance is divine and smells fresh and exactly the way it should smell. These bombs are made with essential oils and they are large. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. One bath bomb dissolves in about ten minutes in hot water. The fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening. BUT.....I used the rose bath bomb and the final color of the water was an indigo blue which turned my heels and toenails a SMURF BLUE. I also had a blue ring around my ankle. The skin color dissipated during drying but the nail color stayed for several showers. The blue coloring was easy to rinse off the foot bath.The current price of $32.99 comes to $2.75 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again I feel these are better than others I tried previously. This would make a wonderful gift as long as one does not mind the color changes particularly to the nails. I really love them but only for a foot bath.
227. There are six medium, thick, and elegant birthday gift bags in this set. Also, there were supposed to be 12 handle ribbons that have to be assembled with the bag but only 10 ribbons were supplied. This means one bag cannot be used because there are no handles for it. To assemble, it is important to hook the plastic tongue above the hole or the handles will fall out.These bags are attractive and high-end. They are perfect for birthdays. Each bag fits two one liter bottles of olive oil with room to spare or it fits one bottle with lots more room to spare (see photo).   However, at the current price of $10.79 ($11.99 minus 10%) for 6 bags it comes to a pricey $1.80 per bag. Since I only received 5 usable bags in my set, it comes to $2.16 per bag.
228. My recommendation is to stick with the PM2.5 filters. These filters are way too thin (just one ply) and the design is odd. In addition they are way too big to fit in any one of my over 45 masks. I actually had to fold them in half in order to tuck it into my masks' filter pockets. I would never order this again.
229. There are six medium-sized, thick bags with striped gussets in this set. They are only 4 inches longer than their small 8-inch bags. Also, there are 12 handle ribbons that have to be assembled with the bag. It is important to hook the plastic tongue above the hole or the handles will fall out. These bags are shiny and beautiful. One bag will fit three one-liter bottles of olive oil, with the top coming a little above the bag or one one-liter bottle with a cake box (as shown in my picture) that then leaves a little room to spare. The current price of 16.99 comes to an expensive $2.83 per bag. These are elegant bags but at this price they should come pre-assembled. Similar bags of this quality can be purchased much, much cheaper at the local dollar store. Therefore, I consider these 5-star gift bags at a 2-star price.
230. This is a very nice shower set. I love buff puffs over loofahs any day. To me this is not a loofah set but a puff set. What I like about these is that they lather the soap very well.  The handle on the back wand has a nice grip but it is only 10 inches long from where the wood goes into the puff. My other back brush has a 15-inch handle. I still can use this but it is not as easy a reach. This is the only reason I took off one star.In addition to the body and back puffs, a stick-on hook is included. Note that the whiteblack plastic should be peeled from the hook to reveal the silver finish. I did not use the hook because I already have hooks in my shower. However, this addition is also a nice touch.Overall, I really like this set. I would consider this 5 stars if they made the handle longer on the back puff.  The current price of $9.89 ($10.99 minus 10%) is very reasonable for this set. I also love the variegated black and white colors of the mesh.
231. I am beyond upset with this order. There are four sets of metatarsal pads in this box but three of the pairs are for the right foot only (see photo) and one pair has a left and right pad (see photo) in it.These are difficult to insert into a shoe because the back is very sticky. This means the first placement has to be final. I was able to insert one pair into my shoes and they offer some comfort. I would have rated this four or five stars if they shipped actual pairs and not pairs for people who have two right feet.This is another product going in the garbage because they are not usable as is.
232. There are six medium, thick "Thank You" bags in this set. Also, there are 12 handle ribbons that have to be assembled with the bag. It is important to hook the plastic tongue above the hole or the handles will fall out.These bags are beautiful, especially in the black with gold lettering. This medium bag fits two one liter bottles of olive oil  with a little more room to spare for other items such as a wooden spoon set, etc.The current price of 13.99 comes to $2.33 per bag which is a little pricey. However, these are lovely bags but I just wish they came pre-assembled.
233. These masks are perfect for winter. They are 3-ply, thick, warm, and super comfortable. There is no nose wire or adjustable ear elastics but I find that is not needed. Also, there is no inner pocket for a PM2.5 charcoal filter but that does not matter to me. I love almost everything about this mask. The black color goes with everything too and keeps dirt from showing. There are three in the package.  The current price of $17.05 ($17.95 minus 5%) is on the pricey side of competitive coming to and I would expect the three to $5.68 per mask. I put this in a lingerie bag in the washer and lay flat to dry. This mask gets 4.5 stars from me.
234. This mask is perfect for winter. It is 3-ply, thick, spacious, and super comfortable. There is no nose wire or adjustable ear elastics but I find that is not needed. Also, there is no inner pocket for a PM2.5 charcoal filter but that does not matter to me. I love almost everything about this mask. The black color goes with everything too and keeps dirt from showing. There are three in the package and I would expect the three to be priced at around $15 or $5 per mask. I put this in a lingerie bag in the washer and lay flat to dry. This mask gets 4.5 stars from me.
235. I take a size 9 to 9.5 women's shoe and that is the size I ordered (see photo). However, the sizing advertised is all wrong. This is more like a size 11.5 if measuring from tip to tip. Also, I just noticed that they claim a smaller woman's size equals a larger men's size. That is incorrect. A size 9 in a women's would fit a size 7.5 in a men's size and not vice versa as the men's sizing is always 1.5 lower than the female sizing. These cannot be cut down so I can't use them.If these fit, they do have some cushioning and arch support, which is good. However, it is made of super cheap foam and there is no way this is worth the $49.95 price ($24.95 if applying the $25 discount) they are asking. I would not expect this to sell for more than $6.NOTE that I tried to attach the sizing listed on the Amazon site and point to the wrong sizing but Amazon would not post that review, so I removed that photo. As of this writing, the men's and women's sizing is reversed.
236. I ordered the pleated light blue mask known as design 1056. The cloth is very comfortable and once I wrestle with the cord and get everything situated, it does provide full coverage of my face with the cloth extending far back under my chin but I have to make sure I guide the elastics behind my ear. If I do not do this, the mask will not stay on. It is also a very large mask. I do not like the behind the head adjustable cord because it keeps tangling in my hair and also keeps coming loose. As long as the mask does not move, coverage is complete and the material is soft and breathable. I also like how I can pull the mask down and it just hangs around my neck until I need it again. The big negative is the cinch cord and the constant adjustment. The cord also gets crooked and is not always even and I have to keep picking it out of my hair.The current price of $6.99 would be expensive but competitive if this worked well. In its current design, I hate it.
237. These disposable masks are like every other 3-ply disposable mask of this type that I tried so far. They have comfortable ear elastics and the mask is pleated and moldable to the nose with the interior wire.  There are 50 masks in this package.  The current price of $8.99 is a great deal for 50 which comes to $.18 cents each.  Since these are disposable, they are not designed to last, obviously.
238. I absolutely love these masks. The design and colors are attractive to me. The material is thick and layered and they are comfortable to wear. These are perfect for the fall or the winter. They are made of 100% cotton and the current price of $14.99 for these two masks are a reasonable price at $7.50 each.
239. This is a nice blend of essential oils for aromatherapy in a roll-on tube. The directions say to apply a small amount to the temples and behind the ears, the inside or outside of the wrists, or just inhale deeply. I used this several times already and love the fragrance but dislike that the aroma wears off in less than 30 minutes.It is made in the USA; I am not sure where the ingredients are from. The ingredients are pure sweet orange, bergamot, lavender, and Cedarwood essential oil in a base of fractional coconut oil.The tube does not say this is vegan even though the Amazon site says that.If this lasted longer, I would have rated this 4 or 5 stars.
240. I really love these towels. There are 50 "cloths" per roll for a total of 150 "cloths" over the three rolls. The exterior design is festive. Starting the roll is difficult because the first piece is glued on real tight. However, once I got the first piece off, I was good to go. I was able to wash the counter with these or clean parts of my cats' litter pans. They are strong and reusable. I do feel the current price of $17.99 ($19.99 minus 10% off) is expensive. However, if these rolls last long and I can reuse more than several times, then it might be worth it because at the current discounted price it comes to $.12 cents per sheet. Only time will tell how long this will last.This would have gotten 5 stars if they were not so pricey. However, this might not be 5 stars for everyone. Since it is a paper-towel like "cloth," when it is wrung out it is hard to unravel. I found myself picking apart the squeezed out cloth.
241. There are four black lanyards in this package. The loop is too small to get my head through. If I extend the pushbutton adjuster to the very end so that there is no loop (meaning the inclusion of the mask on the ends will create the loop), it is still too small. Also, I cannot get any of the clasps to open to attach the masks. I squeezed and squeezed and they barely budged. This is complete garbage and that is where I put this--in the trash.
242. This box is gorgeous and elegant and has diamond like etchings on it. It is also as sturdy as those colorful square boxes one can buy at Home Goods. The front flap magnetically closes. Since it is a beautiful silver, no wrapping is necessary. The only problem I have is that it comes with a bow that looks like it has been run over by a truck with black marks across it  in many places (see photos).To set this box up, all I had to do was unfold it. It is one piece and unfolds into the shape shown in less than a couple of seconds. There are no ugly creases; just a beautiful and sturdy box that can be used repeatedly for storage or for gifting. This particular version is the size of a small shoebox and will hold some lingerie or a small pair of PJs. The current price of $9.99 ($11.99 plus $2 off) is competitive. However, until they fix the problem with the supplied ribbon, I recommend passing on this.  
243. This case is not as small as I expected but it is still small enough to travel with. There are four large compartments that will hold many small pills or several large pills or supplements. The push button open pops open the top but the lid only stays open at an angle unless I push it up. I like the color and feel of this case and it certainly has a purpose for the right application. The silicone loop can be used to loop it through something like a carabiner, etc.
244. There are 30 shimmery champagne gold boxes and 6 pages of 20 clear stickers (totaling 120 stickers) that come with this set. They come in one piece and fold into a mid-sized box.I finally figured out how to fold the box bottom correctly. The tabbed flaps go on the outside of the bottom and interlock into the other flaps. They are not very sturdy, so I suspect that 4 of the 120 stickers should be used to secure the 4 tabs as shown in one of my photos.As long as one seals the bottom, it should hold. These are perfect for Christmas gifts (no wrapping needed) or for cookies, cupcakes, or other classy gifts.  Each box should be able to fit about one pound of cookies depending on the size of the cookie or four regular-sized cupcakes. Overall, I think these are classy but I do not like the interlocking design of the bottom that requires stickers to provide hold.The current price of $18.99 for 30 comes to  $.63 cents each which is reasonable
245. My boyfriend and I are highly impressed with this set. There are two pretty lilac heating and cooling wraps. We heated them in the microwave for two minutes each one. They come out really warm and are soothing as a neck wrap, to lay over the shoulder, around the arm, or leg.  These can also be used cold by putting them in a waterproof plastic bag in the refrigerator for at least four hours to chill. We personally only use these for heat therapy.There is Velcro along one end to keep the wrap in place. One has to be careful not to let the Velcro touch any delicate clothing because it is strong and can damage delicate fabrics like sweaters. The wraps are unscented and made of clay beads and millet. As a result of the ingredients, they are heavy. These wraps cannot be washed; they can only be surfaced cleaned.The current price of $22.99 for these two wraps is very reasonable. We are both highly impressed.
246. I had recommended sleeves like these for my boyfriend to offer ankle support and compression. I own other types of sleeves like these that help me with my plantar fasciitis. Nevertheless, he tried these and says they are very, very comfortable. He likes them as "socks" but says they do not offer any support or compression. I tried them on and they are too big on me. I got size 13-15 and he takes a 13 shoe, so these were the right size for him.He personally does not understand why they are open toe and neither do I. Nevertheless, he likes them for other reasons other than what they are advertised for. To him these are five stars for comfort but they do not hold up to the support claims. Therefore, look elsewhere for ankle support.
247. I actually ordered this for the pill cutter. Unfortunately, that arrived cracked but it still works. The pill is cut by a razor-like blade in the middle of the plastic cap. The pill has to be balanced on the tray below. Its use is somewhat successful.The two single-day pill boxes open easily and are portable for travel. They do what they are supposed to do, which is hold pills. However, my boyfriend and I wish these were clear so that the pills can be seen. This is the only negative with the cases. Also, the case covers are held on by a thin piece of plastic that will eventually fall off with lots of use.The current price of $9.99 is on the expensive side for this set but still competitive. There are better pill cases on the market. However, the cutter is what makes this set worth it to me if only it were not pre-cracked.
248. There are four colorful compression socks in this package. I wear a 9-10 shoe so I selected the largex-large size. A compression rating of 20-30mmhg is supposed to be firm and strong; however, the compression is very light. Also, the toe box feels as if it is sewn awkwardly on the sock. It is not uncomfortable, but has to be adjusted just so to feel best.I wore these all day and they look and feel great. These colors are fun and the socks feel almost like regular knee-highs.  Overall I do like them but I took off one star for not feeling like a compression rating of 20-30mmhg and another star for the weird toe box.
249. I purchased over 20 pairs of these  for my various shoes to reduce my plantar fasciitis pain. They never stick permanently but they work well for me. However, these arch supports look and feel nicer. I particularly love the heart-shaped design. I also tried similar arches , but now I am liking this better.There are two pairs in this package. It is perfect for a tall arch like mine and they feel very comfortable in my sneakers. They do have an adhesive backing, but I do not expect them to stick forever. So far they provide me with good support. I might purchase these in the future over my Dr. Scholl's or the other ones I just tried. They are all good to me.
250. I ordered several of these in different colors for review including the one in , and they are all junk and stick in place. All had to be thrown out.This black one is as terrible a pill case as the other colors. The door is difficult to open and the chamber was stuck on Saturday and a half. I cannot even use this; not to mention if I could I would not be able to see the pills. I threw this out. Avoid like the plague.
251. This is my fifth pair of Lollop compression socks. However, two of the pairs are a smallmedium size and three are medium large. This is a mediumlarge and runs a bit big.I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a medium  large size which is supposed to be for that size foot. However, they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle. They do fit around the calves nicely, however.I love that they offer medium compression (15-20 mmHg) around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches. I felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs. I also like the "normal sock" look of these knee-highs and they wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry. The blue hearts are very attractive even though the off-white is a bit dingy looking. I consider these socks very stylish. The material is 45% cotton, 40% nylon, and 15% spandex.If the sizing was specified correctly, this would have gotten 5 stars. 
252. This is a typical hardcover journal. It is nicely bound and has a ribbon bookmark so that one can locate the page of where they left off. It is also ruled. The only thing I do not like is that the date is on the right side of the odd pages. There is a date and page header on each page. On the left side of the book, these are located on the left. However, on the right side they are located on the right.  I would expect the date to always be on the left, no matter whether it is an odd or even page. It also would have been nice if they numbered the pages automatically since one is unlikely to remove pages from this nicely bound book.Other than this, this is a nice journal that is built to last.
253.  Included in the package is one sound and LED light ball with 3 AG3  LR41 1.5V batteries also installed. There are also 6 other replacement batteries included and one screwdriver to open the battery compartment for replacement.All I had to do is pull out the plastic tab on the battery compartment and press the on button. Once that is done, the ball lights up with alternating red, yellow, green, and blue lights and it chirps like a bird (see video). It did not sound like a mouse to me. It runs for about 12 seconds and goes silent until the cat moves it and the cycle repeats.My three cats lost interest immediately. I kept moving the ball for them but they eventually just walked way from it. I think this would be good for kittens but I doubt full grown cats will be enticed.The two pictures show my one cat losing interest. In the last picture my cat Ricky is walking away. I took the video the moment I gave it to my cats so there was some interest for a few seconds.
254.  There are six bath bombs in this package as follows:- Tranquility (a.k.a. purple lavender); it is pink- Acuity (a.k.a. chocolate mint); it is lime green- Calmness (a.k.a. chamomile tea); it is yellow- Harmony (a.k.a. jasmine flower); it is white- Romance (a.k.a. la vie en rose); it is electric pink- Happiness (a.k.a. lemon tree); it is yellowThe fragrance of all of them smell similar to me but unfortunately, I cannot describe it. It is like a perfume I want to get rid of.The fizz of these bombs is terrible. See video of the calmness bomb. The yellow color made it look like a floating egg yoke and when it was dissolved, I felt like I was bathing in a tub of urine. The only thing I liked about these is that they are slightly moisturizing. Other than that, I am disappointed.
255. There are 20 gallon-sized plastic storage bags in this box and each has a slider closure. The Cowboys emblem takes up the entire front side of the bag as can be seen in the attached picture.What I like about these is that they expand at the bottom. In the picture, the bag contains two 17.63 ounce containers of marcona almonds and I had room to spare.  The expandable bottom ensured that these stand up on their own.  Overall, I really like these. They do feel a bit thinner than other Ziploc bags but not so thin that it matters much.These are great for storing nuts, cheese, crayons, a wet bathing suit, and anything else that can fit into a one-gallon bag. At the current price of 9.99, this comes to $.50 cents per bag.
256. My boyfriend swears by tart cherries in any form.  I've read a lot about them and sour cherry reduces inflammation and muscle soreness, helps with insomnia, and prevents gout (a form of arthritis).  Inflammation is my middle name so I wanted to try this. Although, I don't have gout, I do have arthritis in various parts of my body. I also have daily muscle aches and inflammation (which was recently verified by a doctor), yet after consuming these capsules for a couple of weeks, they have had no effect either good or bad on me. I should be finished with the bottle in another two weeks.  The positive is that I did not have any side effects.  I've used Nature's Bounty red yeast rice and although that product worked for me to lower my cholesterol, I had a permanent nasty side effect from it. Therefore, I consider the absence of any bad effects with this supplement a big plus. On the other hand, I've had no reduction in soreness or inflammation so it's like taking a placebo for me.  It does appear this tart cherry concentrate works for some, so I suggest anyone considering this give it a try.Depending on how many pills are taken per day, this bottle provides a 60, 30, or 20 day supply. The recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills per day with meals. The max I've taken was 2 per day.I called Nature's Bounty to understand why the bottle says 1000mg equivalent on the front, yet the back says 250mg per capsule. What the fellow say to me was that the powder is concentrated and the 250 is the weight if you were to empty the contents of the capsule. However, he said since it is an extract, these compressed components are equivalent to 1000mg per capsule. Whether this is really true or not, I have no idea.As for the ingredients, besides the tart cherry (prunus cerasus) fruit extract, each capsule also includes vegetable cellulose and less than 2% of silica and vegetable magnesium stearate. This is suitable for vegetarians.
257. In addition to this new Linea squeegee, I have three OXO shower squeegees two of which are in service at any given time:-  (my favorite)- - I have been using my  OXO squeegees anywhere from twice daily to once every other day depending on which shower I'm using and if I'm taking one or two showers per day.This unit comes in three pieces--the suction cup (which has to be screwed into the stainless steel holder), the stainless steel holder, and the squeegee. Its features are:- Partial crystal-like handle- Rust proof stainless steel in brushed nickel finish for top of squeegee and suction hook- Slightly angled neckPROS- It has a long 10" blade so it's great for wiping down my shower walls in a few passes.- The streamlined design looks sleek and elegant (except for the Lucite-looking handle).- The blade wipes smoothly and leaves my walls and shower doors streak-free.- The suction cup holds hard on my acrylic shower walls.- The blade appears to be replaceable by loosening two screws.- It comes with lifetime limited warranty (guaranteed rust-proof finish, will replace if defective, etc.).CONS- To me this is heavy as it weighs in at 6.5 ounces (excluding suction holder).- The handle looks like Lucite or glass and if the suction cup gives way when it's hanging I expect it to break when it hits the tub or shower bottom. In fact, the weight of this thing might nick the bottom of a porcelain tub. Only time will tell how this holds up.- The handle is too thin for grasping comfortably.- I wish the blade head were a little more angled.Compared to my other squeegees, I actually like this one the least mainly because of the thin fragile handle and the lack of a deeper angled head.If I were to rate my preference in squeegees, my first choice is the  ,  (4.7 stars), and the  . This squeegee  I rate 3 stars because, the handle needs to be thicker and in stainless steel and the head more angled. At the current price of $39.99 plus $5.25 shipping, I feel this is overpriced for its current design.  Nevertheless, this squeegee is a looker and for those who have very large showers and baths, this 10" blade makes short work of wiping away the water.
258. I use these for my car windows when they fog up and it does work on glasses as well.
259. It's a nice bunch of stuff  packed in a box. For the money  it is worth  it very nice selection  of stones.
260. They slip around on nose pad quite big
261. The problem is that they wear out in just a week or so.
262. A very good brand we're buying more and more under this brand
263. He did not measure properly it's too small but we're using it
264. Have bought this probiotic at pharmacies over the counter lot cheaper at AmazonSo instead just going out for a probiotic we will buy  at the comfort of our home
265. Love the Cube design.. perfect for those who want to use in a small space. An air purifier with a white noise output! Device itself creates a white noise that actually can be soothing and will not interrupt sleep or conversation.I appreciate this comes ready to use… And includes an extra filter. *One concern I do have- is there is no listing for replacement filters to purchase at this time..!!! The concern is if it’s necessary to replace this item prior to being available online? And second issue.. what will these cost! This matters for me to make a claim this is value worthy to a buyer. As you can see- these questions can affect whether this purchase holds true value: ifwhenhow much replacement filters will be.. and it’s my reason for detecting x1 star.As for functionality.. this seems very easy and straightforward. This contains solid and helpful instructions that include diagrams as well as real time photos- see pic.’s I included. It also includes a small screwdriver which is needed to open cover at given time- very helpful to be all inclusive. *hack: keep instruction manual, extra filter included and tool all in one place.. this will simplify the filter swap when needed!Buttons are white with gray writing and have indicator light when selected.. but, for any with less than stellar eyesight- You may need to navigate choices under regular light source.. at least till you’ve become familiar with button placement. Otherwise, it can be hard to see. Not a deal breaker just a factor to consider.. who will be end user and could this pose an issue?  Once you selected a  function.. this works as expected and does a fantastic job. It allows varied speeds and set timing options- it even notifies when filter must be replaced… lets just hope it’s available! Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe.
266. Little to no force required, durable, file on the handle is a nice touch!
267. I've been using this for about 3 years now and after trying about 5 other products, this one works the best. We have 2 kitties !
268. my favorite toothpaste my only problem is the tube is too small
269. Wifes meds and she loves price and convenience. Looking forward to many more useful buys. Thank youfor ease of ordering.
270. I like the picturet.I can carry more then one prescription
271. This air freshener is perfect for a room we have a bunny rabbit in! It takes all the smell away! Great product for the money!
272. I always recommend people try half the dosage for a few days before continuing blindly.  Any herbal supplements need to be treated if you haven't been checked out by a licensed herbalist - each blood type and body may take to a herbal supplement differently.  Ginseng is a strong and effective herb to support the body's energy.  this one was powerful for me so I only take half dosage a few days a week.
273. All the goodies of bone marrow without cooking it myself!  So good for your cartilage health, especially if you run, Amy high impact activities.  Easy to take, and no after taste.  I tried another supplement from this brand, and I am impressed with their quality, that I am taking this to improve my joints.
274. We use these heel pads for all new leather shoes until we have broken them in.  It literally prevents the tough leather digging into your ankle and often creating a bleed. They last a long time, and grips well onto any shoe.  It has become a must for us at home. Not dealing with a bleeding and painful ankle joint again!
275. love there are various shaped containers that I use for holding specialty flourbaking goods and homemade pasta.the lids are very tight and holds liquids in without no leaking; although that said the lids are hard to peel off and hence use for solid goods.With all plastic, you need to be careful to throw away of any white cracks.  Otherwise,  solid product from Amazon.
276. it is an easy way to ingest superfood and I use this with my smoothie - i kinda throw in a lot of super food related powder in my smoothies.  with regards with this product - it does not have a strong over riding flavor , which is great as I prefer to taste the fruitsvegetables.  this is a great supplement if you are working out a lot as it is hard to replace nutrients lost from ordinary food without adding a lot of calories.love that it is fresh and sealed well to keep the product fresh.  I would buy this product again.
277. This is a forts for me, and I wasn’t sure if this was going to be a waste of f money and time.  I wash my hair daily now, due to exercising needs.  What I loved about this conditioner and despite the color and the initial scent. The end results was beautifully soft hair and a beautiful honeysuckle smelll!  If it weren’t for the fact I washed my hair everyday, the fragrance would linger.  It is not overpowering at all, just a whiff when you shake your head.  Wow. I can’t believe this conditioner, and it didn’t leave my hair feeling too thick and sticky.  I am converted to continue with this brand.  Not sure I am brave enough to try the other brands.  Definitely a hit for me.
278. Elegant it is and heavy too, just a note to make sure the suction pad is tight before hanging the squeegee.  It hung best against the glass shower door, not so much on the wall.  Besides its sleek look it functions pretty awesomely with its long length to cover a wide area and the rubber worked well to pull the moisture off the surface.  A good squeegee
279. Bought these for my 8 yr old grandson and he loved them.  He tells me they are very warm and comfortable.
280. Held up well even in the wind!
281. We've tried other covers previously that took too much effort to put on. This one was quick and easy to use! Worked perfectly! No issues or leaks!
282. They did not taste good at all. Very expensive for what you get. They taste old.
283. The convience , the durability , makes things faster in shower getting ready for work !!!
284. I love this thing! It helps my back pain quite well, is easy to use, and fits great! Perfect product. Excellent support!
285. These gummy vitamin C supplements are great. I love that they include bioflavonoids. I do dislike the amount of vitamin c per gummy, but that is pretty standard. You'll have to take 4 of these to equal one pack of emergen-C. They taste great and are a good option for kids.
286. This is a good supplement with vitamin c, zinc, and magnesium along with a blend of herbs. The capsules are easy to swallow. Because of the magnesium, I take it at night since magnesium can make you sleepy. My only real complaint is the amount of vitamin C isn’t high enough in my opinion. Only 255mg per serving, so I still have to take an additional vitamin C supplement.
287. I love these reading glasses. They are really comfortable and crystal clear. I wasn’t sure if I’d like the metal side or not, but they haven’t been a problem at all.
288. The pillow itself is really comfortable. It is super plush and thick memory foam. Very comfortable. Definitely made for an adult. However, the fabric isn't the best. It is soft, but the stitching isn't durable at all. The snap on mine broke off pretty quickly. It just ripped straight out without me pulling or anything. The pillow is just heavy and if you are snapping it to your bag when not in use, it puts too much stress on the weak seams.Update: downgraded my star rating because the cover fell completely apart after only a few uses. Then you just have this memory foam “pillow” that definitely needs a cover. So, about a month from opening the package to throwing the pillow away.
289. This is the second keychain in this style I have owned. I really prefer this one to my other. This one is made of neoprene type fabric, so it stretches better than the canvas type and puts less stress on the zipper. It comes with 8 58 dram amber vials with orifice reducers and lids, so you can fill them with your essential oils. About 30 drops of oil fit into each bottle. You can use smaller vials, as well. And I have found you can it a few even larger vials. (I have a few 0.12 oz amber bottles that fit in the four center slots.) You'll want label stickers, so you remember what you put in each bottle and those DO NOT come with the keychain. The pouch keeps the glass bottles safe and well protected. I definitely recommend this keychain for having oils on the go.
290. This is great powder! It is my favorite. My boys use it to powder inside their pants for sports so they don't chafe. It is slightly pink in color because of the calamine, and can stain white undies with a pink tint. But this stuff works really well. It is also great at preventing heat rash.
291. Order the ones for fingers and toes, got the ones for toes only.  Returning!
292. Not more than a glorified piece of velcro. Not what was expected.
293. I really don't know what to say other than it's horrible it doesn't blow long and I would not give it to my worst friend anime kid me that's my opinion
294. Fits my Water furnace Series 7 perfectly. The MERV 11 is great for the area I live in.
295. One thing is certain, these are well made cheater glasses but not for me.  The frames, which are very nice and stylish, are too small for my head (6'4" male).  They look super cute on my partner though, although she needs a slightly higher magnification than the 1.5 I use.I did notice that these seem to have a much closer depth of field for me.  Most Cheaters let me sit back from my monitor screens and be able to see out about 4 feet, these seem to be under 2.  Once things are within 20 inches or so, they are amazingly sharp and clear, but not until it gets that close.The price is great, 3 for $15 is about as good as it gets, and these are very well made for that price point.  I am actually fairly new to cheaters but finding that I definitely need them from time to time, so I am keeping these are emergency backups in the office, car, and home.  Can't beat the price, and I actually used them for some clay work I was doing because of their razor sharpness.
296. I'm a little divided with my partner on this one.  She seems to really like it and I'm definitely more tepid on it.  It is soft and it does have secure Velcro (at least for now.)  I like the color and it is not completely unflattering when she wears it.  But I find it a little lacking in quality of materials and details.  The Velcro looks visually uncomfortable and I'm not a big fan of the way the elastic bunches the fabric, nor is the fabric particularly plush.She sees lots of potential as a swimming and bath wrap and would probably give it five stars and I would give it three so I split the difference.  Personally I would just like something that exudes a little more quality, but I will not doubt the utility.  Particularly, the Velcro does hold very strongly and you can feel secure in that it will not suddenly release like a normal towel.  Price is not bad, but I would pay more for more.
297. This is a Christmas gift for my Granddaughter....of course she has not used it yet, but,  It looks beautiful and I believe she will love it.
298. Wow, cleaned my BBQ so beautifully, plus my two wood stoves and the bricks around them.
299. This cleansing brush system is excellent. First it comes with a beautiful carrying case, it has a huge body brush. Second, it has a blending brush for getting facial creams well blended into your skin, which means you you less cream and it is fully absorbed. Third, it comes with a facial brush for deep cleaning your face. Fourth, it comes with a pumice stone as well. All this plus it's battery operated. You really don't need to buy separate gadgets, save money and be completely satisfied with this system. It truly is a wonderful system and I highly recommend it. I bought this with a discount, but would gladly pay full price for one for my daughter in a heartbeat.,
300. I cannot believe how just drinking a great tasting tea ( which I love to do) can have such a profound affect on my complexion. Well I can tell you that it does, my skin is soft and glowing and to be honest I do use skin care products that are all natural or that don't have such rash chemicals in them and they do work great. However after trying this tea my results have doubled even tripled in some areas like my glowing complexion and the softness of my skin. I'm 53 and people have actually accused me of jokingly lying about my age, most think I'm in my early forty's What? Thanks Baetea for the opportunity to try this amazing tea. I know some of you already knew the benefits of tea and I do to for health and overall wellbeing, but for skin and complexion I had no idea.
301. Use for Fog and haze weather,Gray sky,Fog weather, Dust weather, Snow weather, Building site Etc.Not for Medical use. It has 3 layers and covers my whole face. I feel like it will protect me and those i come in contact with; and the price was right.  The ear loops are comfortable and the nose piece keeps my glasses from fogging.
302. It has the touch and strength of high-end plastic cutlery. Labeled "Compostable in Industrial Facilities" and that you should "check locally as these do not exist in many communities." It probably goes without saying that these are not suitable for backyard composting. The bonus is that these are made from renewable sources.
303. At this strength I take one a day and it's relieved the arthritis pain in my hands almost completely, I was not able to walk two miles without having to stop because of the pain. A friend turned me on to the pain relief of Turmeric Curcumin  with Black Pepper. I've been using it for two years now it has the right combination. I now walk 2 miles without any pain at all. I take one a day.
304. In the last month I have tried 3 different brands and this by far was the most unappealing taste, I was hungry and I didn't want to finish it.For flavor I would say the best was - SPLENDA Diabetes Care Shakes - Meal Replacement Shake, 8 Fluid Ounces Per Bottle (French Vanilla).For low calorie and protein the best is - Premier Protein 30g Protein Shakes, Vanilla, 11 Fluid Ounces
305. It's significantly louder than my other tool (Foot Scrubber Electric Foot File Callus Remover Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools for Cracked Heels and Dead Skin with 3 Roller Heads White by BOMPOW).On first try I thought it didn't power-up but you have to hold the power button down until it powers up.I like that it comes with 3 heads to suit different issues.Waterproof! Safe to use in the bath or shower! I am shouting with happiness because this is the BEST EVER, SO MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THE MANUAL TOOLS!The only negative is it doesn't come with a adapter for the wall, only a USB charging cord. Also because it has different attachments a small cloth bag would have been wonderful to keep it all together.
306. I loathe when using a disposable hand-towelwashcloth and it falls apart in your hands - yuck! This will never happen with this product. This is very substantial and not like the flimsy ornamental hand-towelwashcloths you find in many guest bathrooms - all show and no substance. These cloths feel rich and substantial and completely absorb the water after washing your hands.
307. The sponges are what you would expect to buy at a dollar store. The steel wool should hold up for many months - the sponges I expect will last a month.
308. It's as thick as the name brand and about the cost as you would pay at a box store but slightly less expensive then the name brand you can buy here.
309. Goes down and stays down, no after taste. Currently 56 cents per dose. EPA 900 mg, DHA 600 mg, Other Omega-3 Fatty Acids 300 mg; The company Vimerson Health is new to me and was trademark in 2015 from what I have found.
310. I'll date myself here, I have been a Packers fan since Vince Lombardi days - lol. You you can surmise I was thrilled that Ziploc has Packers storage bags - easy choice to make.
311. Actually works & long enough to cover my curvy figure too! Stays put, lightweight so I don’t get too hot either. Love it & will give as gifts too!
312. OH MY GOSH.... THIS IS SO COMFORTABLE!!!  My back is so happy...thank you!
313. I really enjoy creating my own custom essential oil blends. Black pepper is a new discovery for me. It has a warm and spicy scent that adds an extra kick of something exotic to your blends. It pairs well with woody scents like pine, cypress, and cedarwood. It's also nice with citrus notes like neroli and bergamot. It's ideal to use in rooms where you want to feel relaxed. Surprisingly, it can help you sleep better. Overall this is a good buy. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.
314. This product isn't for you if you don't like sweet potatoes. The bar is basically a sweet potato fruit bar. It's all of the nutrition you want from the real thing in a portable form. You can take these on hikes, throw them in a bag, or keep them on hand for emergency food. I'd definitely recommend this as an alternative to high sugar bars.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.
315. Quitting smoking is probably one of the hardest habits to break. Any help you can get is great. This system kind of combines rewards and therapy. The sensor helps you track your levels so you get positive reinforcement when you smoke less. There's also access to an interactive community to share the journey with others. It's okay to get help when you need it. It doesn't make you weak, it makes you smart. Good luck!!!Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.
316. Indoor air quality has become of the utmost importance these days. Most people want to do everything they can to keep their homes safe. This gadget is a novel approach. It uses UV-C light to sanitize the air in your home via the HVAC system. It's something that can be used in combination with an air filter to improve the air quality in your home. The unit is small and easy to install. The bulbs can be replaced when they die. I think this is an excellent invention. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.
317. As a true nerd, I really enjoy the packaging that looks like a beaker. It gives you the instant impression that what's inside is very effective. The toner addresses several issues with one easy treatment. It calms irritation, balances oil production, smoothes texture and brightens skin tone. It kind of straddles the line between toner and essence because it also moisturizes. It's ideal for oily and acne-prone skin. Use twice daily for maximum effects. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
318. Plant protein is a better choice for your overall health. The texture of most is less than desirable. This powder has a non-gritty texture that is easier to palate. The taste is also an improvement. The blend of plants is different than some others I've tried. The watermelon seeds are a novel addition. You may need to add more liquid to this than with whey if you don't like a super thick shake.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
319. CoQ10 is an essential supplement for overall health. It is used in all of our cells. It's especially useful for neurological and cardiac function. It's important that the CoQ10 you choose is water soluble so your body can fully utilize it. This one is 100% water soluble. This supplement also includes vitamin E. This is a high quality supplement that you should consider adding to your daily diet. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
320. This is a unique blend of plant-based protein with anti-inflammatory ingredients like tart cherry and turmeric. It's very low in net carbs and is ideal for anyone on a keto or diabetic diet. The vanilla cold brew flavor is delicious!! I like this as a post-workout recovery drink. I highly recommend this product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
321. I watch lots of skincare videos. Massage is a key step to increase blood circulation, naturally lift lax skin, increase collagen production and help products penetrate deeper. This massager has three different modes with three intensity levels for each. The cleansing mode warms skin and helps open pores for deep cleaning. The iontophoresis mode is ideal to use with a sheet mask to increase circulation and improve elasticity. The transmission mode uses red light to brighten skin, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production and increase product penetration. Use this mode after applying your entire skincare routine. Each cycle runs for four minutes before the auto-shutoff is engaged. The unit doesn't operate unless the massage head is in full contact with skin. You may need to apply pressure for it to start. I highly recommend this device as part of a healthy aging skincare routine.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
322. Now is a great time to take care of your immune system. It helps you fight off everything from colds and flu to cancer. These gummies taste great. They have a blend of elderberry, propolis and echinacea. They're all known to boost immune function. The gummies are very easy to take and are soft and chewy. I highly recommend this product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
323. If you've ever ruined an item of clothing or upholstery due to a stain, you'll definitely want this product. The spray protects fabrics from all kinds of stains. You may want to apply a few layers for some fabrics. I highly recommend this product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
324. With this mister, you can change regular water into a hydrogen-rich treatment. In addition to hydration, you get the benefits of preventing oxidation. The device is small enough to fit in most bags and is ideal for travel. It's a good way to refresh your skin on the go or to keep it moist between skincare steps. I highly recommend this product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
325. I've never tried a protein drink that's basically a shot. It's a novel concept that I enjoy very much. The bottle is small enough to fit in a bag to take on the go. You can drink it alone or add it to other liquids. The flavor is pleasant. There are artificial flavors if you're trying to avoid them. Otherwise, this is a good product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
326. Bitter melon is a good natural medicine. It can help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels. It also helps to regulate lipid levels. You can make a tea or add it to your favorite liquid. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
327. CLA is a secret I've used for years to control my weight and help me build and retain muscle. This formulation is very potent. The serving size is four capsules.

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
329. If arthritis runs in your family, you definitely want to get a jump on it before your joints start deteriorating. This supplement is excellent for joint support. It contains high-potency anti-inflammatory ingredients. You won't feel a difference immediately, so give it time to work. I highly recommend this supplement.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
330. This is a superior form of Coq10. It is absorbed better than other formulations. This supplement is useful for many cellular functions, so it's a good idea to add it to your diet.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
331. We all know we should be eating more greens. This is an easy way to do so. The powder can be added to any liquid. You could also bake with it or add it to sauces. It's quite versatile. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
332. Moringa is so nutritionally dense that it's referred to as the "miracle tree". This powder is easy to stir into drinks, drink as tea, or add to smoothies. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
333. I watch lots of skincare videos. I often see gadgets like this one used. It's a much easier way of deep cleaning pores and doing extractions. It uses ultrasound to literally vibrate impurities out of your pores. If you flip the blade over, it can be used to push skincare products more deeply into the skin. The instructions aren't very clear on how to use the blade for different functions, so you may have to watch videos from one of the bigger brands (like Pop Sonic) to learn how to do so. Other than that small gripe, I highly recommend this tool.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
334. Triphala is probably as ubiquitous in India as aspirin is in the US. It's used for digestive health and overall balance. You can make a tea with it or simply add it to your favorite beveragesmoothie. For the best absorption, you should take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
335. I use household gloves all the time, so I know a thing or two about them. These are high quality and come in at a budget-friendly price. The length is longer than average to keep your sleeves dry. These sets come in several colors, so you can choose your favorite. I'd get several just to keep them on hand.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
336. I think every household needs cleaning gloves. These have the same quality as Playtex. They are latex-free so you don't have to worry if you have allergies. There are different colors, so you can color code according to task. This is a great buy.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
337. If you want a good facial cleansing brush, but don't want to spend $200, this is a good alternative. The brush is compact and easy to hold. It doesn't take up much space on a counter. It also packs well for travel. It's cordless and rechargeable. It's a good skincare tool. Don't forget to clean your brush with antibacterial soap after each use.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
338. This is a great set of gloves. They can be used for many different tasks. You get a few pairs so this is a good deal. They're latex-free for those with allergies. The material isn't too thin or flimsy. The length is a bit longer than standard. They're high quality gloves.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
339. Beet root powder has a plethora of uses. It's excellent for cooking. It enhances any chocolate dessert. I use it to increase my stamina and endurance for workouts. I add it to my morning green drink. It's chock-full of antioxidants. It's also great for skin health. Over time, you'll notice that your skin has a healthy glow when taking this supplement. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
340. Astragalus has many health benefits including immune support, liver cleansing, healthy skin, and stress support. It's a great adaptogen if you have trouble sleeping due to stress. The powder is slightly sweet and mixes easily into liquids. If taking for sleep support, I suggest using it an hour before bed.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
341. Neem oil is great for hair and skin. It helps strengthen strands and improves elasticity. It encourages hair growth and can prevent unnecessary shedding. It is also good for fighting wrinkles. The capsules are filled with oil. You can easily puncture them with a thumbtack or sewing needle and add them to either hair or skin products. Another great use is to add some to your favorite clay mask to make it dry down slower. I think this is a great buy.Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
342. Considering all of the toxins to which we are exposed each day, it's probably a good idea to detox your liver on a regular basis. Milk thistle has been used for this purpose for many years. This particular product is raw and organic which makes it ideal. There's enough product to last for two months. I'd suggest mixing this with your favorite liquid in a blender or a shaker to make sure the powder is fully dissolved. Here's to a healthy liver!!
343. Reishi is widely used in Eastern medicine. It is a Qi (vital energy) tonic that has multiple benefits including cardiovascular health, immunity, stress management, increased energy, and sleep support. I like this particular product because it's organic and sourced from whole food. I highly recommend it.
344. They were exactly what I needed for close sewing work and made all the difference in being able to see to thread the needle!
345. I do like kuumba but its always a hit or miss. I've purchased a few different kinds and one may hold its scent and smell lovely while others have absolutely no smell whatsoever.  Its unfortunate.
346. Unfortunately, it did not remove the odor as I had hoped.
347. I have spent years making homemade bread for my family and one of my most important tools has been a plastic dough scraper I got from a King Arthur seminar several years ago. Without explanation, my scraper simply disappeared without a trace and no one knows what happened to it (I think it got tossed in the trash by accident). I went about finding a replacement and after looking at a number of products I chose this one based on the price and the positive reviews. It has proven to be a good tool, a little different than my old scraper but still fine for my needs.Instead of plastic, this one is stainless steel encased in silicone. There are a couple of important factors here. First, because of the silicone shell the scraping edge is soft and pliable. This is helpful for scraping around crevices and getting as much dough from a round plastic bowl as possible.  Because of the stainless steel inside, the whole is stiff though still slightly bendable which allows it to flex just enough to clean the bowl of my stand mixer without fatigue or permanently getting warped or bent. It is stiffer than my old plastic scraper, and while this is a positive thing it does require getting used to it.Unlike my old plastic scraper, this one will work on a hot saucepan. That’s good news for when I am making candy and don’t want to wait for the syrup to cool and harden, requiring a lot more effort to remove. I did not find any statement regarding the temperature limit for this scraper but based on other silicone utensils I have it is probably safe up to around 400 degrees F.And...silicone is more non-stick than plastic so clean-up is a little easier. It was never bad with with my plastic scraper, but it did require a bit more effort than this new scraper just because of the nature of the materials of each.I’m very pleased with this scraper. It meets the need I had and it is better than my old plastic scraper that I used for years. It works well, it can be used on hot or cold cookware and it is very easy to clean. It’s reasonably priced too. Based on my experience, this is a very easy product to recommend.
348. Anyone involved in sports has the potential of suffering a strain or injury to the knee, especially if the sport requires running or repetitive motion. Having injured a knee in the past I know how unpleasant this is and how long it takes to recover. I didn’t have a sleeve like this when I was recovering but I wish I did.This knee sleeve is made of a stretchy material that provides enough stretch to fit comfortably but still remain snug; that is, it does not cut off circulation while is stays in place. It does not pinch or cause irritation behind the knee when the knee is bent either which is nice. The whole is very breathable though it still gets a little warm when worn (to be fair, I am writing this at the onset of summer – everything is warm).The main feature of this sleeve is the silicone buttress that supports and semi-immobilizes the kneecap. It is a round insert (insert in the sense that it is sewn in, not removable) that provides two things for the knee: it keeps the knee cap from floating (a residual problem I still have from years ago) and it provides some cushioning that assists a bit with minor impacts. The cushioning is nice, but keeping the kneecap in place is very helpful as it keeps it from sliding and pinching the muscle.While this sleeve does slightly restrict movement is does not really interfere with most activities. It is comfortablebreathable, it provides good protection for the knee and it keeps things in place so the knee can heal faster. Overall I am very pleased with it and wish I had this years ago.Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.
349. We are extremely pleased to find this 500 pack of larger pill pockets. They open easy, are wider than the standard pill packs, and we will stick to the brand going forward. Excellent price and quality.
350. These are great glasses for light sensitive people. Have owned 3 pair and have found nothing better than this Noir dark plum 4% for coverage. Highly recommend these
351. Much better quality & filtering than the original filter provided by the CPAP manufacturer. Perfect size. Loaded with fibers for superior filtering. This pkg of fiber filters are a great price. I will be re-ordering.
352. This is a lovely set. The “either hand” mitt fits a woman’s hand, perfectly. I love the duo thumb holes so I can switch hands.The length of the back scrubber is also just right, making it easy & comfortable to use (other’s I have bought were so long it was difficult to use). I really like the medium knubb of the material - gives a good scrub but soft enough to be gentle on your skin. The end handles are strong & positioned just right.Both pieced are easy to use, make lots of lather & are easy to rinse clean then hang to try.I will definitely buy again & think this set is pretty enough to make a nice holiday gift, as well.
353. Unlike the picture this thing is about the size of a quarter and broke the first time I used it. Don't bother getting it. It is not what is shown on the picture and it was only one tiny, tiny thing that never worked. Waste of money.
354. Love these pads! They are comfortable, and make you feel extra fresh.
355. Hear these are just the best to use! Grabbed 3 packs
356. This stuff is amazing. It really removed marks on your walls and doors. How it works??? But it does.
357. This product is Ok for cleaning up but not as good as advertised for tough stains.  Matter of fact if you use too much or scrub too much it leaves a pink stain!
358. Got for my daughter it helps her so great buy
359. Highly recommend great taste and great buy
360. Keeps my skin safe from the luekotape I put over the cover roll stretch tape
361. Love the smell. Not sweet and cloying like some others. Also, keeps bugs away. Had an ant problem at one apartment, used this around any sweet drink, no more ants in my tea or soda. No more ants on my tables. Around the windows and doors, they stopped coming in. All the bugs stayed away.
362. These are great although for tight spaces they will break off in your teeth and you have to be adventurous to get them out. But otherwise they do the job they are intended to do.
363. For when I am craving dark chocolate and raspberry -- this one has good flavor, high protein and less carbs.  Beware about eating more than one a day though -- unless you are wanting a cleansing with cramps.
364. I do love the color variations present throughout this carved piece of natural jade, but it does have an uneven notchblemish present along the longest edge that obviously resulted from a tool mark mistakenly made during the grinding process. This scraper does have an unshiny, matte finish (it is not super glossy like some other gua sha tools I’ve used), so it might be more preferred by those searching for a natural looking accessory, and it seems comfortably sized and shaped overall.It does come with an attractive drawstring storage bag with a leafy botanical design, so that is a nice bonus, I just wish every edge of this scraper had been smoothly shaped and polished. But that’s the only critique I have for this one. It’s great for increasing circulation and lymphatic drainage and for increasing the absorption of various face serums! I’d gladly recommend this jade tool to others. 🌿
365. I love these aromatic steamer shower bombs! They are vividly colored, appropriately sized, delightfully scented, and affordably priced, and they always provide an invigorating shower experience! Each disk comes individually wrapped, and the entire set is attractively packaged, but I will say that any other scented products I use at the same time as these overpower the fragrant scent of these bombs (simply because body washes and shampoos are closer to my nose). The air is scented strongly for up to about 3 feet above each bomb, and they dissolve cleanly without staining surfaces, so I’d still recommend this boxed dozen to others!
366. I’ll start by saying that the pair of jade facial tools I received do indeed match the online product photos. The gua sha scraper is a significantly darker shade of green than the lighter bright green hue of the accompanying roller. I’m not sure why anyone would intentionally choose a set of paired tools that differ so drastically in color, but at least they’ve been accurately represented in the listing.While the scraper is smoothly polished and comfortable to use and hold, the dual-ended roller is rather noisy. Unlike most other jade rollers currently available, this roller doesn’t have the clear silicone plugs present inside each drilled cylinder, so all rolling motions produce a clunking sound as the stones bump up against the metal bars of the triangle-shaped hardware. The stones are nicely polished and attractive otherwise, and each end of the roller still provides adequate pressure, but the overall functionality leaves a little to be desired since a silent rolling mechanism hasn’t been ensured.At a current list price of $4.95, this is by far the cheapest jade facial set I’ve come across, so it might be great for new users who are looking to test drive a pair of these tools before possibly selecting a slightly more expensive version, but the visual impact of the widely different color shades is definitely distracting.
367. The antioxidant-rich solution contained in these squeeze pouches is packaged and produced in Canada. The directions say it should be stored in a dry, dark place at room temperature, and the flavor tastes like tart grape juice. 🍇 The ingredients do list the presence of a couple of preservative compounds, but I like that there are no artificial flavors or added sugars, and the box comes stamped with a clearly marked expiration date.There are only 10 calories present per serving, but the recommended usage schedule advises consumers to take one sachet twice daily. At $20 per box, it would cost customers $120 a month to consume this resveratrol supplement regularly (because 10 pouches would disappear every 5 days). Since the overall price and perceived value of any item is subjective, the purchase likelihood will vary from person to person, but the potential payoff is exponentially beneficial.If this super fruit solution can combat free radical damage enough to slow or reverse aging, then I’m in! Since it does also contain goji, blueberry, pomegranate, cranberry, açaí, and green tea extracts, I at least feel like I’m consuming a myriad of healthy juices in the process! I’m pleased with the brand and the easy-to-open packaging overall, but I’d probably rather have a single container of the liquid substance rather than multiple single-use pouches. I try to support ♻️ reducing waste however I can, but that’s my only critique of this one!
368. What a fabulous foot-care product this is! The metallic turquoise coating of this handheld file device is visually attractive, and the ergonomic design gives it a shape that’s extremely easy to grip and comfortably hold. The bottom surface features a whole sea of circular nano-blades that painlessly file away rough and dry skin in an instant, and then the powdered skin particles immediately rinse away with ease! The foot scrubber arrives with a drawstring plastic pouch that’s great for storage between uses, and I would highly recommend this affordable product to all my friends and family. I’m so impressed with this one!
369. Was looking for something different for cleaning toliet. Easy to use. Good value for the money.
370. I was looking for something different for the heart burn. Has really good flavors. Good value for the money.
371. The daily supplements are great to take and hard to miss. They're somewhat larger than normal, and very condensed at that. They're easily the largest pill I have to take as a supplement that is not chewable.
372. I've been taking Fish oils for years now (on and off), and I consistently come back to this trusted brand. I have bought other brands but for the quantity value, and the packaging (glass bottle), I stay with Carlsons. For me, Fish oil is not a pleasant taste, but this brand has disguised (as much as possible :-) with a lemon flavor, which makes it easier. I think this is my brand for life.
373. Don't fit my glasses
374. Nice item.
375. During allergy season my nose used to get so sore—now it doesn’t.
376. Work very well with my machine. My old ones developed a 'quirk' where the wire plugged into the unit. Now it works again. The item arrived quickly which was a good thing as I really needed a dependable set of wires at the time. Those who use a tens unit know what I am talking about. The price was super reasonable for 2 sets and they shipped free with prime.
377. Purchased for my grandkids and they they elderberry syrup year round. They stay pretty healthy too.
378. Do not buy this! Do not buy this! Do not buy this! The product does not work very well it is overhyped the battery lasts but a few minutes when they say that it lasts almost an hour. It is a piece of junk add hardly worth what they're asking. I would highly consider using something else cuz this is certainly not something you want to spend your money on nor is it even that pleasurable.!
379. leaves pattern on food tears too easy
380. Yes I am pleased with these natural glass nail files.  I use them all the time, sometimes a different color.
381. This double sided brush is decent for dogs- my only issue is that after a few weeks the bristles start coming out- it is not a very durable brush.
382. Very soft on your face, eye holes are dipped in so the material is not rubbing on your eyelids.Hooks up super easy thru Bluetooth if you want to listen to music while you sleep- main reason I bought these because I always have the TV running which bothers my husband- now he can listen to his music and fall asleep without an issue!
383. Well who doesn't like a good bath sponge! Lol.Needed new ones for my family and this was a good set at a good price.They are soft and suds up! 🧽🧼
384. Exactly as shown
385. This product could be 5 stars if it worked consistently. I don't know if the controller has to be in the perfect position or there has to be no pressure or some pressure on the pad itself, but it will either come on for a few minutes then stop or not start at all. I bought this a little over a year ago and these issues started months ago. Its really aggravating when your in severe pain from a chronic disease and can't get up to make a hot water bottle because it hurts so much. I'm on disability so I'm poor, I buy this thing and then it doesn't work after 6 months. Its really depressing because for the short time it did work it really made a big difference in pain control.
386. Save your money and buy a roll of bounty paper towels.
387. I have reviewed before.  I was totally disappointed as this did not work on my glasses - one side or another kept sliding off.
388. kinda cheap quality and overpriced
389. Maybe my skin is too dry or too sensitive because I just didn't experience many positive results from 100% Pure's Cocoa Bean Facial Scrub. The scrub is contained in a tube with a screw onoff lid.  Reminds me of toothpaste as it is fairly thick and dispenses rather firm. Does not lather. Contains small cacao 'nibs' for exfoliation. Has a pleasant chocolate scent that is not long lasting.  The scrub is supposed to exfoliate, polish away bumps, flakes and dull spots, calm redness, promote a balanced tone and make skin glow.  The only result I experienced was soft skin.  And I do mean soft.  But there was no glow to my skin, the red patches (dryness + eczema) didn't go away and dull spots remained. Softening my skin was a nice benefit but not enough to warrant continued use of the scrub. I have no plans to purchase use this in the future.
390. KAIRNE's reusable bamboo cotton rounds  make up remover + metal storage container is such an awesome product and at a ridiculously low price!  The metal container comes in 3 colors: black, blue and green. I have the black and its so pretty.  2 separate lids are included, one goes directly over the cotton pads, the other is for the container itself.  16 bamboo cotton rounds fit in the container . The cotton material is 70% bamboo cotton, 30% regular cotton.  You might think the number of rounds is low. It is not.  They're reusable , durable and hold up incredibly well.  One  bamboo round is equivalent to 100 disposable (regular) cotton pads.  The 16 bamboo rounds are going to last a VERY long time!  Also included (and I find this so  neat and unique!) is a 100% cotton laundry bag. Simply place the dirty  bamboo rounds in the laundry bag, add it to a load of laundry and you've got 16 freshly washed bamboo cotton rounds! How neat is that? You can also hand wash  them as well. (KAIRNE recommends washing the rounds prior to the first use and I did so )The only makeup I wear is eyeliner. I use the bamboo rounds to remove it and to apply toner.  Boy, are they ever soft and do such a great job!I have dry, sensitive skin and have no allergic reaction of any kind with these rounds.I've been using compressed mini facial sponges for my makeup removaltoner application regimen.  I do like the sponges but I far prefer KAIRNE's reusable bamboo rounds and will be using them only  from  now on. I definitely recommend this product. Should you not like it or have a problem, KAIRNE offers a 100% money back replacement guarantee.  This is clearly a company that stands behind its products and values customers!
391. I love what EvridWear has done here!  3 pouf balls, each with a different exfoliating level: white (light), blue (moderate), dark blue (heavy).  You get to try each pouf  all and choose your favorite. ! I love the white pouf, my husband likes the dark blue.  The variety isn't the only awesome detail.  These poufs are VERY well  made. They're incredibly  strong and durable, with  tight bonding that ensures the pouf won't quickly stretch out or fall apart.  Each does a great job washing exfoliating skin (all skin types!)  and produce a nice lather with soap or body wash.  I have terribly dry, sensitive skin and these poufs do not irritate or scratch my skin in any way.  All 3 are comfortable to use.  They even have small rope so the pouf can be hung up when not in use. The colors are nice as well.  I love the plastic zipper bag the poufs come in.  It serves as an excellent storage bag to hold the poufs until they're used. I was seriously shocked at the price. For as high quality and well made as these poufs are, I would have expected them to cost far more!  There's a pouf for everyone's preference. I just LOVE that EvridWear thought to do the 3 different levels. What a fantastic idea !  EvridWear even offers a 60 day quality guarantee. Your skin is going to look AND feel great  thanks to these poufs! Definitely recommended!
392. I've had insomnia for 2+ decades.  Its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel, even when I'm in a room far from elevators, snack machines, etc.Last week we went to Atlantic City for a few days.  I was lucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snackice machines but I knew that wouldn't be enough.  I took a silk sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the best.On the first night, I was exhausted from driving and walking around all daynight, yet I couldn't sleep. Then I remembered I had packed the mask and ear plugs so I climbed out of bed and got them from my bag.  Boy, did the mask make it nice and dark!  The earplugs blessedly gave me total silence as well! I did not fall asleep immediately, but sleep DID come and that RARELY happens for me on vacation.  I usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake. What a nice surprise to actually be able to get a few hours of sleep.The mask darkened the room tremendously. Even the next morning when I woke up to a sunny, bright and cloudless day the room was still dark for me thanks to the mask.  The mask was nice and soft and the mask itself was comfortable. The band that went around my head was very tight and took a bit for me to get used to.  The earplugs did a glorious job of drowning out my husband's horrific snoring.  On the second night, I was able to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed asleep through the night, thanks to the mask that kept the light out of the room and the earplugs which, by the way, are very comfortable and flexible and soft , that kept the horrific snoring sounds as well as the maid's cart noises from the hallway silent!SO glad I had the mask and earplugs with me. I was actually able to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them~
393. Hilarious!  Great paper too!
394. I buy these every year for my Halloween parties.  They’re waterproof and easy to evenly apply.  They sit in a galvanized bucket of ice and water all night and stick tight.  Cute.
395. Love it but wish it had a suction to stick to the shower wall!
396. I bought one for my 'hearing less ear' and was so impressed because in a crowded store the sound stayed true. So impressed that I took them up on their offer of savings if I bought a 2nd one. It just arrived and I tried them both. WELL...As it turns out my 'bad ear' wasn't the bad one at all! It was my right one. So with volume set on '1' for the left ear and '2' for the right ear, I had GREAT HEARING!!!I had bought a less expensive one from someone else and the moment I had walked into the grocery store, I had to remove it, the buzz noise was overwhelming.But these are the greatest for me! One was really good, two were the greatest for me!
397. Great moisturizer!  I  look better already :)... usually cheaper on Ebay though.
398. If you only need a quarter of an inch expansion these probably work okay for anything more they just stretch out
399. Arrived on time. Strength equipment to others of same strength. Narrow, rimless lens perfect for reading & watching tv at same time.
400. All ingredients come packaged separately in a nice little clear box. I followed directions exactly and the soup was delicious. I am hoping it will knock this cold I have been fighting for the last week.
401. Works great
402. Works great
403. Perfect for Eli-pens and the orange color stands out when in the bottom of a backpack or a purse or whoever you leave them!!
404. I wear a women's size 7. The size small slippers were a little big but once I tightened it using the adjustment rope, it was snug on my feet. The interior was soft and felt nice. It was a little uncomfortable walking around in the slippers because of the battery pack at the top of the slippers. You definitely felt the bulky weight. Other than that, the slippers were great. They were non-slip so I didn't have a problem walking around. It got nice and warm when I had it on the highest setting.
405. Great additive to water
406. My husband has pollen sensitivity.  We put this on his side of the bed and he can definitely tell the difference in the air quality.
407. I bought this hoping to increase my fiber intake to help regulate me.  It turns out it's only soluble fiber, which didn't do anything for my purposes.  The product itself is easy to take.  It dissolves fully (after a minute or two) and is completely taste and texture less.  It's easy to take, but it wasn't any use to me.
408. What can i say,it's a Foot Bucket that doe as it;s supposed to.i do like the fact that the handle folds over to hold  towel.
409. Works well except in a very large pill (12 - 14mm.)
410. As advertised
411. Very handy to keep in purse for emergency
412. Doesn't stay charged long. Also no instructions for what probe to use for different areas of body
413. I love everything about this oil, for the scent, & moisturize it does on my skin.
414. I don’t know what planet you guys are on but this is the worst car cleaner ever it leaves a white residue that’s almost impossible to get off even if you rub it immediately after you put it on. I’m returning it whatever you do do not buy this product
415. Loved the bags and quick delivery, have already used them and given them to my friends
416. good for  finger nails but wont cuts toe  nail cutting opening to slim  handles a lot shorter than  shown
417. Not bad better then my car seat
418. Too too strong to wear I get a headache and lose balance and eyes need to re-adjust
419. lid not sealed. when i shake it to clean out, water droplets go everywhere. but the translucence is good; can see through to see volume without having to see the pee.
420. I have fragile skin that tears with a normal bandaid. Even with being easy to remove, sticks very well.
421. I love how great it cleans and how wonderful it smells
422. I had to try this a few times before reviewing.  I have major problems in one of my feet, and it hurts all the time.  This massager is just on the edge of hurting, BUT after using it, my feet feel great for hours.  If you can't stand a very firm massage, this is not for you.  To get the right pressure you really need to move your feet around in it to get where it's comfortable.  It does have different settings, but no real way to adjust the squeezing pressure.
423. I honestly do not know why I did not realize how small the bag was. Everyone thinks its a lunch bag. It can fit my stethescope and sphyg as well as a few small lightweight things I use at work. Its good quality, but tiny.
424. I put in my gym bag and take it to yoga, pilates and the gym. It is lightweight, fits perfectly and works like a charm. I like that I dont have to look for the lacrosse ball or the peanut; I always know where they are. Just perfect.
425. This is my second jar of this wonderful product.  I've had a skin problem with drying and peeling and this vitamin E cream heals my hands up nicely.
426. Great Product !!
427. It works ok. The onoff and temp. buttons are in a bad place on the handle  -  I keep pressing them by accident.  My hair is medium length,  the curling action would work better on longer hair.
428. I found these very challenging to read.  I really have no others to compare them to, but I'm thinking these are hard to read based on my experience and some of the other reviews.  I will be trying another brand.
429. I use this product every day.
430. works great - exactly as shown.
431. for the price, it's good.  One thing though..  depending where I moved it on the kitchen floor (or bathroom floor) it was off consistently by 2 pounds up or down.  Which means it's the floor, not the scale  For example, it would say 128 or 130 but nothing in between and not all over the place. When I was weighed at the doctor office, it was consistent.
432. So much cheaper than the stores and just as good. Super quick shipping, will buy them again when needed.
433. They charge quickly and easy to manage in one hand to get a great cut with edges.  The guards are perfect to blend and it's easy to clean.
434. My husband has issues with a rotators cuff. The pain is widespread. I love being able to put large pads in four spots and getting to all the pain at once. He loves it too!
435. This really needs a sealing water tight seal! The whitening gel is WAY overprices when baking soda and peroxide work just as well. But, I still recommend this product for the blue light IF one is very careful not to get it wet at all.
436. Somewhat disappointing. The head is quite small, and not particularly full or fluffy. There is no way to remove the head to wash it and put it back on the instrument. At some point, I will have to hand wash just the head in the sink I guess. Very inconvenient. I would have expected a higher quality product at this price point. I will turn to a janitorial supply resource.
437. Love this Deco Mesh.  Looks really nice in my wreaths!!
438. It is still sitting in my bathroom, the instructions are worthless.  All the bottles are marked with the same description.  I will probably just throw it away.
439. I really like these. They are very comfortable and they work pretty well. I had to break them in half though because they were too big for my ears
440. I wish I liked the taste better. They are tolerable  and I am not sure how well they work as I have only been taking them a short time
441. I used the whole bottle and didn't notice any change.
442. This product is pretty good so far. I don't mind the taste at all. It makes my teeth feel clean after I use it. As far as whitening, we'll see in time!
443. Did  not help me with shoe slipping
444. I like these bags. They do clear odors in  enclosed spaces.
445. The Ingredients of this fish oil is great! It works great for me and I heard it’s great for lower cholesterol.
446. The paper towels are very soft and the design is simply beautiful. The value of the paper towels are great. And I think these towels can be good decoration for my room.
447. This toothbrush is small enough for my little puppy. It takes time for him to adjust. But he eventually gets used to it. And I know the importance of cleaning teeth
448. I add this supplements to my smoothies. And it tastes great! It doesn’t taste artificial and and it’s very easy to be dissolved.
449. This mct oil powder taste ok. It needs a few days to get used to it but eventually it works ok.
450. I believe turmeric is so good for your overall health. These capsules include gingers which are also great.
451. I heard that vitamin v complex is good for health acne. But this one doesn’t work for me. I don’t feel any difference whatsoever.
452. Pretty soft, and the price is good. But you can still find cheaper alternatives from Costco or other stores
453. almost the same, well buy more
454. great price, works as expected
455. Got  the clay model and I found it very difficult to warm in my small microwave . I’ve got a turntable and this wrap is large and difficult to pack inside. You end up having to fold it over and then it never heats evenly.  Once I did get it warm enough it was awkward to wear because the weight it at the bottom so it ends up pulling downward and  choking you.There is a rather flimsy strip of Velcro that is supposed to hold it together but it looked like an amateur job. I expected this to be much nicer based on reviews I had read.
456. What can you do when stuff always drips on your shirts?  It looks like an apron .  It certainly beats the movies I've seen where the gentleman tucks the table cloth into his shirt collar. It affords a sense of dignity and looks good.  Take a test drive. I haven't taken it for a spin at the restaurant yet but  I think I might do it.  It's cheap.
457. My son is almost 9yrs old.  He had been wet EVERY single night since birth. He would often wet through pull-ups.  It was really starting to effect his self-esteem.  Sleep-overs and scout trips were difficult.  We had tried limiting fluids, waking him during night to use bathroom, we had even tried Prescription medication.  We had also tried another "alarm" called the Potty Pager.  It was difficult to use, uncomfortable, and ineffective.We started using this wireless alarm since comfort was a big deal for my son.  It worked in just a few weeks.  When he did wet, it was usually just a few drops and it woke him and he could finish in toilet.  Usually even the sheets were still dry - just put new underwear on and back to bed.  It made the whole process not disruptive at all!  I know it sounds cliche but I wish I had gotten this system a LONG time ago.As product stated, the first few nights my son slept through alarm.  His room is 2 doors down from mine.  I am a fairly light sleeper and it would awaken me, and I would go wake him up.  After just 2-3 times, the alarm would wake him up.
458. This tool works amazingly.  I am a diabetic & this works perfect to remove all the dried skin that can cause infections on my feet.  The speed is very appropriate.  Easily cleaned.  Speed is very consistent with it being electrical which I prefer.
459. very thin do not fit well
460. It was exactly as promoted and displayed:) Recieved as agreed!!:) Easy to order:):)! Exactly what I needed...
461. No batteries to worry about!
462. I didn't know I needed metal straws in my life but here I am, using them for every single thing I drink. They're great and easy to clean. Oh and so pretty!
463. I have worn contacts for 20 years now. Wow! And tried many lense brands from acuvue oasis, air optic, acuvue 2, dailies, freshlook colored (teenage years). You get the picture I have sampled a few.Also with that I have probably tried every solution available. Opti-free, bio true, complete, re-nu. It wasnt until a optometrist  appointment about 6 years ago I was introduced to this stuff. The doctor said I had an "eye allery" and advised I should switch to this cleaner.I do not believe I had said "eye allergy" or needed the prescription medication I took. But I did and bought this while checking out with my medicine. I havent used another brand since. This stuff is great! But needs to be used with care. I have had my fair share of red eye situations...it is painful.In my experience when I have had this happen, it was my own innocence that got me there. This product has a great instruction manual and covers almost everything. What they dont say is if you over fill past the line, the poroxide with bubble out of the top pin hole all over your case. Think of a volcano erupting. The lava running out the top.and down the sides. The same happens if the case is too full.So when you unscrew the case you have essentially coated those fingers in poroxide. And if your like me, those same fingers are used to insert your contacts. So you sre basically putting poroxide onto your contact and into your eye.Make sure to discard the solution in the case as soon as you have removed your contacts. Do not reuse.The product is great and it allows me to wear my acuvue lenses for 2 weeks comfortably. They feel like a fresh pair after every cleaning. I will only use.thid solution for sanitizing my contact lenses.
464. Worked very well on my dog’s paws! It’s pretty quiet and can’t hurt your pet!
465. I like the quality and LOVED the price!
466. EXACT same ingredients, down to the .00X percentage, as Lysol Quaternary. I've given up looking for Lysol Wipes or Lysol Spray and most assuredly Lysol Quaternary during this plague, so I make this up in those continuous spray mist bottles and have a ton leftover. Smells wayyyyy better than the Lysol QC, so from here on out I'll stick with this brand.
467. I am highly disappointed! I have never taken hair growth vitamins but since doing the BC not once but twice in the last 4 years of going natural i did extensive research looking for hair growth vitamins that contained everyrhing i would need for healthy hair. I heard great things about hairfinity but decided DasGro had everything my hair needs to grow.Now let me say this: i love the product and wanted to wait till i was done with my second bottle before leaving a review...reason for the 2 stars?I never received my second bottle, yet everyday i'm receiving text messages from the carrier, ( will be delivered today) i had yet received it and when it comes to any type of supplement i like to stay consistent. Sadly i had to spend more money and purchase Hairfinity (went to the beauty supply store ) hopefully it works just as good as DasGro..
468. Cutting back on sugar is a good idea. But some food and drinks simply do not taste good if they are completely sugar free. You need something to add at least a little bit of sweetness to the overall taste without resorting to artificial sweeteners. A product made for the task at hand is Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder.Starting with the nutrition, each four- gram serving of Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder contains three grams of fiber, so this is certainly a plus.  There are 15 calories per serving, which is more than other artificial sweeteners, but still low. The product is vegan and gluten free, too.  I don’t expect much from a nutritional standpoint with any type of sweetener, so this product does rank highly, with the fiber content being its greatest asset.With its other qualities, Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder produces mixed results. It is similar to powdered sugar with its texture. It does tend to clump a little, so if you want it to dissolve with minimum effort you need to sprinkle a small amount into your drink. I didn’t have any problem dissolving it in a cup of hot coffee, but the main problem I had with this is that it doesn’t add much sweetness to your drink. It takes several spoonfuls to make a noticeable difference and if you use this much, the product isn’t going to last long. It is priced somewhat high, too, making the cost per serving a little on the steep side if you use the required amount needed to produce any significant level of sweetness.I encourage anyone to cut back on sugar and if adding an alternative sweetener to your favorite drink will help you achieve your sugar- reduction goal, then Super Organics Agave Inulin Powder is a viable means to achieving said goal. But if you truly want to achieve a sweet taste, then this product is going to fall short because it takes too much of it to reach the required level of sweetness. I usually drink my coffee and tea sugar free, so even a small amount of sweetness works for me. But this product will not be enough for other people, so I am going to give it an average rating overall.
469. as advertised
470. This works very well for my mom.
471. Very comfortable hopefully wont have to use one again but it was a. Great choice bevause you can pump it up to ur contour it inflates around ankle amd shin area !!!!
472. I can feel the pulsing in my hand I get when I hold moldavite so I can say it's real. It is a small piece great for someone who has never used it before it can be intense. I have a bout a four gram piece I carry around in my pocket. When I added this to the bag I felt light headed from just one extra gram. That is how strong this stone is a little goes a long way.
473. I held it in the palm of my hand and in less than a minute my entire hand felt tingely. This isdefinayely real moldavite not glass. I have never had that expirance with a stone before. It is small like about one fourth the size of a dime.one of my most powerfully stones even though it is the smallest.
474. I hats flouride. I go well out of my way to find flouride free products. This is the best one so far. It whitens like a lot of the other tooth pasted can't.  It is travel size but a little goes a long way.
475. Great after a shower.
476. Been using this for years then it disappeared from the grocery stores. So happyto have it on my table again.
477. This does wonders for its size! My bf and I both have extremely bad allergies, especially during season changes. This helped us to get amazing sleep without stuffed noses ever since I got it! It takes about a day to sanitize the air (I have it in an 15x10 room), ALSO my guinea pigs were have allergy problems but after about a week of having this in my room (the guinea pigs cage is in myroom) their allergies cleared up and saved me from a huge pricey vet bill! I'll be buying another soon for my cat room!
478. Worked well to keep my jewelry together while traveling.
479. My daughter is petite. The elastic on the top of the anklefoot was too tight for her and seems uncomfortable. The shoes were made well otherwise, but this seems a design flaw that can't be overlooked. We don't put these cute shoes on her because of this.
480. Item arrived with a crack on wood handle that only got worse with one use.  Now the tool is useless because the handle is broken.  Contacted them and they are simply impossible to work with so after four messages I gave up. Would NOT recommend.
481. I am picky when it comes to any foods I don't cook myself.With that said, my husband is the type who'd eat anything and don't complain.  Of course, taste is very subjective and I am sure a lot of people will love these.My husband said there was no way he could eat these bars.That says it all.
482. I like the product but not this shade. Previously I bought fawn and it looks better on my skin tone. This one just looks like glitter once it’s rubbed in. If you have light skin, you may want to pass on this color.
483. These are very nicely padded, if you are like me and have a skinny arm, then they are loose and do slip down, but I prefer this to the really tight fit that cuts off circulation. I have washed once to check durability, air dry only and they are in great condition. I am happy enough and would buy again.
484. I just can't seem to wear any other type of nose pads than these self-adhesive soft pads. I have tried at least 5 or 6 other kinds and I always come back to these. They are so much more comfortable on the nose and I have a very small nose bridge. These come in different colors and have been the only ones worth the expense!
485. I bought this for facial pain and these are a super fit. I use flour sack clothes as a cover for these. They are super soft and the clothes provide a long length to wrap around my head to hold the cold pack in place. I have migraines and these make my life so much better! I'm glad I bought these.
486. This works. I did find it stretched my pants as it said it would. It doesn't claim to permanently stretch anything so it does exactly what it says. It does loosen your pants for a good days wear. If you wash your pants, they are going to shrink back. I would say my issue with use is being flat lazy. I forget to set it up so I am back to grumbling. Best bet, buy new pants!
487. Work well and good price
488. Worth the price. It makes a perfect curls. Kinda beachy waves.  I have a long hair so I just wish it was little bit longer.
489. Smooths hair
490. This toilet paper roll will be funny when opened.  But for the size of the roll, I found it to be very expensive.
491. Wonderful or someone like me who uses them each morning, I have a box in every room in my house. couldn't  live without them on hand.
492. Best wrap made
493. LOVE THESE! Perfect for demaplaning and peach fuzz! Add a little glycolic acid afterwards and your skin will be smooth for Weeks!I actually tried a 10 blade which is what they use in a spa, and this worked SO MUCH BETTER
494. Makes it so much easier for those taking pills several times a day.
495. I bought this then went to a Pure Romance party and found out you can use it for a lot of things like spraying under your bra line to stay fresh or in shoes. Smells great!
496. The powder has a very strong green veggie flavor, but that is to be expected with this powder.  I had to cut back to one scoop (serving size is two scoops) as I adjust to the flavor of a less sweet and sugary protein smoothie.  I use unsweetened plain almond milk or coconut milk and frozen fruit to make a smoothie with this powder.  It's a great way to increase veggie consumption every day without tons of added sugar or filler ingredients.
497. Adhesive is awful. Advertisment would have you believe this is a mesh product. Actually just an uncomfortable piece of plastic. Also, the claim to stop mouth breathing is misleading. I was able to breath normally through the slit opening.
498. Toilet Cleaning
499. This is probably my 4th walker.  Because it is lighter than the other walkers I can turn it with one hand. Because of the smaller wheels, it is easy to maneuver it in the house. I would recommend it.  It also folds up easily.
500. Compared to other offers on Amazon there isn’t any comparison.  These pads are great. They suck up the liquid and makes my life easier.  I tried others and agree they’re like using a paper towel.  Try them you will not be disappointed.
501. For my condition, the Male Comfort fit  Advantage is Easy to use and easy to empty and clean in the morning.
502. Easy to use
503. I have been wanting to buy a Henry mask for a while. Finally, I bought one. It is so well-designed and fits my face nicely! They are breathable as described. Also, they are stylish. The straps are very comfortable and do not aggravate me. I will be buying more of these masks.
504. I LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A VARIETY OF TEMPERATURES.  IT SMOOTHED MY HAIR OUT VERY QUICKLY.  IT IS SMALL SO IT ISN'T HEAVY AND BULKY.  AND IT IS EASY TO USE WITH EITHER HAND.
505. I really love this pipe.
506. This has a great combination of herbs and really makes one feel healthy!
507. Good dealprice. Does what it was designed to do, can't really elaborate!
508. My family loves the puffs tissues. The aloe is always great during a cold.
509. Open this over a sink, washer, or tub.  The powder isn't bagged, and will spill out no matter how careful you are while opening the box.  Poured the powder into an old plastic Oxyclean container with a lid.  Noticed there was no measuring cup or scoop included.  Glad I kept the old Oxyclean one.  Haven't tried the detergent yet, hope it works better than its initial impression left.
510. It's good, premium, baby oil at a decent price.  What's no to like?
511. Excellent !! Best microfiber cloth for cleaning eyeglass lens leaving them without streaks!!
512. When you can't get in the shower and want to feel refreshed or just clean these are really good to have around. Thick enough that you won't easily drive your fingers through the material but thin enough to be usable. Ok scent. Useful cloths.
513. Little packets resisted tearing open for me. I ended up needing scissors or a knife to easily open these. The flavor was okay. Seemed to help in hydrating the skin something I need a lot of help with. I've had better mix-ins and I've had worse.
514. Biggest issue I had with these, besides having to replace filters, was the very poor fit around my nose. No matter what I tried I constantly fogged up my glasses which was a huge pain.
515. I accept we need to wear masks in public. That's fine, I don't mind. I have some breathing issues (COPD) but I don't run around with fake notes from fake government sites trying to get away with not wearing a mask.These seemed like a good idea for five or ten minutes then someone took a closer look. Other styles of these inserts have clips or hooks molded into them so they can easily be attached to the disposable paper style of mask. These inserts lack any means to hold them in place. You're expected to stuff this under your mask and wish or hope it stays in place. It won't, it's going to slide around while your mask goes another way. If you're lucky it won't pop out and fall to the ground.Breathing while wearing a mask isn't fun. You can do it. Doctor's do it with much more restrictive masks for half a day or longer. but this insert. . . you're literally blocking off 50+% of the surface area inside the mask with plastic that blocks air flow. I sat quietly for five minutes trying this mask out, it became uncomfortably warm inside the mask. I started to sweat. When I tried to talk the insert slid about under my mask. I had to take this off. It was horrible. According to one of the product images in the listing This product will:Realive you from the Bellow Problerms• Mask Stick to Lipstick - Did not test, probably works.• Not Breathing Smoothly - This hindered smooth breathing.• Fogging of Glasses - If anything these worsen how badly glasses fog.• Sultry Wearing a Mask - This insulates and blocks airflow. Hot & stuffy.These were and are a terrible idea. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. . . unless I really didn't like them.
516. I can't blow out a candle through this mask so they're decent for filtering. They're comfortable on my large head. They stand off my face well so they're comfortable even in the Florida heat for long term wearing. The nose bar blocks off enough air that I can get a fair seal and not too much fogging of my glasses. Plus, I like the black better than white or blue. I've worn several so far and not one has failed. Would recommend.
517. I like the way this fit on my face. It's stitched so it stands proud of your face so breathing is not too hard. Where some masks sit so close tom your mouth you tend to inhale some of the fabric if you exert yourself. But that was all I really liked. There's no slot for a filter and it's only two ply and worse even though the ear straps stretch fairly well there's not enough elastic and they pull painfully at my ears. You can see in the image how it's pulling my ears forward. I wish this had fit better because I like the design, it looks like an old bandanna and I wore a lot of those camping and hiking.  Women, teens and children will get a good fit out of this but it's not for men with a largish head.
518. This is not three ply, it's two. It's usable in an emergency, the texture is rough, but really just a novelty gift that will gather dust until it's regifted or thrown away. The printing isn't centered per sheet so it loses some of it fun if it can't be read or the emoji is half missing. Still, as a gag gift it's good for a laugh. Not much else.
519. I like shower poufs, have used them for decades now. It's rare to find black ones, my favorite color. These are reasonably soft. Softer than some I've bought at the grocery store. They're very big and dense. Almost, but not quite, too big to hold onto. I've nearly dropped one several times but always managed to maintain my grip. I would probably prefer these a bit smaller but since they're in my favorite color I won't complain too much. They hold a lot of soap and build lather well.
520. I received this product and promptly put it in the refrigerator for twenty four hours or so. I took one out noticing the easy open label on the top. It actually was. The plastic covering peels off with minimal effort and I think just about anyone will be able to twist the top off. . . Unfortunately. I've drank some bad things before. I've even had spoiled beer that had unidentifiable chunks floating in it. This was that bad. It was revolting. Chalky and bitter with a horrible chemical, sour, twang. I had two mouthfuls and I was still tasting this hours later. Yes, I ate and drank other things to try and get rid of the taste but it lingered. Hands down this was the most revolting thing I have ever drank. Tossed the other five bottles in the trash. I do not recommend this product. Unless you don't like someone, a lot.
521. These were delicious! We love peanut butter flavored anything. I'd even try a soda flavored with it. The bars were slightly small but that kept calories. . . reasonable. Plenty of energy and help me feel full. A little melty in Florida heat so maybe not perfect for summer hiking. Definitely good taste!
522. The nose area is firmly formed and doesn't fit my face. If I put the mask on with the eye pieces set comfortably on my face then I get a lot of light leakage. If I get the nose section laying flat the eye pads are practically on my eyeballs. I can't blink without my eyelashes annoyingly rubbing against the eye pads. Poorly designed, poorly fitting.
523. The lidocaine does a decent job stopping pain from irritated skin. The menthol is almost, maybe just strong enough, to actually reach deep enough to the muscles.  The product was also nice on mosquito bites and my parapsoriasis. The only issue I had was it got on a white t-shirt and it's still on that white t-shirt after one wash. Maybe a few more washes and it will fade entirely. I thought about using this to help heal a new tattoo, the lidocaine really intrigued me but the menthol worried me on a raw wound that a fresh tattoo presents.
524. I had to modify these a little to get them comfortable to use. The plastic around the body come up too far towards the cutting end. I took off around a 14 inch to be able to get the cutters on my nails especially on the corners. That project out of the way the grippy plastic on these made cutting my nails so much easier. I've suffered some nerve and spinal damage this year and that has made gripping the typical smooth chrome clippers completely impossible. These could be a little sharper but beyond that these do what I needed.
525. I cannot recommend these. The design works well if you have problems with your hands, but the materials don't last. I've purchased these twice. The first lasted pretty long, 1 12 years, then the end of the plastic shaft snapped and it came apart.  I ordered another which lasted only 4 months before breaking at the same location.
526. Since we are at 6 million deaths as of today precaution prevails these are great for slipping inside of decent paper masks and probably regular ones I don't know but I put them inside of paper masks when I don't feel like messing around with heavier cloth ones for example at the hair stylist. My only complaint is that is actually a compliment, they have a little bit of stickiness to the edges so occasionally you'll peel them off your face but I've yet to break out or had any residue but I find an unobtrusive and living in a building with long hallways, fire doors, and non maskers it's better to be safe than sorry I can recommend
527. It's not the same I used to use. Scent went from soft and baby powder to almost kind of rank or weird.  I feel like this is the new Coke ... They changed something that wasn't broken.  I won't launder anything in it except bath towels and bathmats now.  Very disappointed as I thought it would give clothes the soft scent that it always gave my daughter's clothes..  I'm just going to stick with tide free and clear even tho I was hoping for a little soft scented aroma therapy on pillowcases and sheets.
528. Did nothing for me.
529. Tastes pretty good, but arrived melted and discolored. Also, I did not realize they were fruit flavored.
530. This is the best product for cleaning the soap from our shower stall. With a wipe of a paper towel it it clean and shiny! I now have a never ending supply!
531. This brush is not to brush your beard out.  This brush is to apply bear oil and balm. It does that awesomely.  I use it every time now to apply the balm I use, then I comb or use a stiffer bristle brush to do the actual taming of the beard.  Unless you've got the worlds softest beard, (or are using it under your belt) this brush can't comb out your tangles.It does a great job applying the balm to base of the hairs.
532. The mask was an odd composition and smelled chemically, like old tires. I thought I was getting 3 masks. I got 1.
533. It’s ok. Not sure it does a lot, but we’ll see.
534. Drop one tablet in the HE washer, and it it provides plenty of bleach.  No mess.  no fuss.  It is also effective as a cleaning and disinfectant elsewhere int he house.  With liquid bleach being so difficult to find, I highly rate these tablets.
535. The thing does not work and looked like it had been opened before we revived it.  What a joke this product seems to be.
536. Used them at band rehearsal.  Wow, the sound was clear but at a reduced volume. So many plugs muffle or modulate the sound to the point where the music is not listenable. So far, these help to reduce the ringing in your ears. They also make a long stem version making it easier to remove. This version in not detectable,  very discrete. Go ahead, protect your ears!
537. It's awkward to hold and use. Therefore, some shavings don't make it in to the cup. It does a pretty good job. Easy to clean.
538. These tablets seem to work very well. I have an older washer and sometimes it gets a musty smell after so many uses. It was easy to use these you just dropped the fizzy tablets in and let the washer agitate. Then you stop the washer and let the tablets do their thing for a couple hours. Then you turn it on rinse and you're done. My washer smells a lot better and looked a lot cleaner after using them.
539. These are nicer than previous used because of the gripper knob. They really exfoliate my skin and make it soft and clean. It was a good buy and came quickly.
540. Love this product, won't use any other.
541. Cover fits well and allows me to wear the Phonak under my shirt and protect it from the moisture when I am working and perspiring.  Only thing I don't care for is that cover must be pulled back to insert the charging cord.  But, that's a minor inconvenience.
542. These seem to be good, simple, inexpensive ear plugs. Nothing fancy here, just the usual. They work well enough and stay in fine. I bought these to wear to a concert in a smallish venue (1000 ppl) for a concert, and the sound system in this venue is always FAR too loud--much more than other venues. These did the trick, blocking enough of the sound to prevent ringing in the ears.
543. Had to order this for a black toilet
544. always use them extra soft
545. The only way to buy them in bulk
546. Soft, strong tissues.
547. I have been struggling with intense food intolerances for over ten years. Every month I added more food to the “do not eat list” until I was reduced to stone fruit and broccoli, basically. This removed much of the muscle pain caused by food. Gradually I am regaining some tolerance. I am on my third box. I have some energy again and some hope that things will continue to improve. I tried other forms of DAO, this one works best for me. I pray I can continue to afford it. It is prohibitively expensive.
548. I have to be careful with these or they give me a terrific headache. Be careful of taking with anything else.
549. The true test of a disposable fork is using it with a tough cut of steak. These have held up well without any of the prongs breaking off. It is nice to know that they are compostable so these can be added in with the compost pile. Great forks (never thought I’d use those words).
550. The ingredients in this tend to be difficult to notice as the effects aren't really immediate, but over time they are noticeable and offer a fantastic boost. Cordyceps has many benefits along with Lions Mane. I really enjoy the full assortment in this blend and have made sure it's added to my continuous use list of supplements.
551. I reeeeally like the goal here. The problem is these are like plastic grocery bags in terms of thickness. You need to be very careful as these year fairly easily. I do like the goal here though and that is why feel the product should still be supported.
552. I truly like this blend and feel it’s very necessary for the summer months, especially during high pollen (and summer snow aka cottonwood season). I try to start it a couple weeks before high pollen and take like an extended antibiotic for around 30 days. It’s not a product to use year round but you’ll notice if you don’t use it!
553. I was never able to get proper use out of this product. I had found it included in several protein related recipes and decided to buy it but the recipe didn't list a brand. This was definitely not the right brand. It also leaked all over the bottle.
554. My definition of 'attractive' may be disputed, but when I say that this is accurate I mean it. The first thing I did after I unboxed the review sample that I received from the manufacturer was to test just how accurate it it. A few notes: I am not going to regurgitate the product description or specs on this page. I will give my impression and highlights that led me to give this five stars. Also, mine shipped with an included tape measure, which was not mentioned in the description at the time of this review. It's actually a high quality one that has an auto-retract mechanism that adds even more value to this set.I test a lot of scales so I have standard weights that are used for calibration, and in this case comparison. My approach is to use different weights, then repeat the weighing. There was no deviation among the results from all tests.In addition I also performed the same tests using a different scale and received the same results. My conclusion is this is accurate per the product description right out of the box.You can switch among pounds, kilograms and stones by pressing a button on the underside of the scale. Plus this is accurate to one decimal place (in .2 increments), so you can see detailed results if you are battling the pounds (or kilos or stones), as well as weigh objects.A few things that I especially like about this scale are the large display, which is a big deal at my age, and the blue lit background. I also like the fact that it will come alive as soon as I step on it and give me the bad or good news after a few second lag, and will go back to sleep shortly after I step off of it.Among the scales that I have tested this one stands out in ease of use, display quality and accuracy. It's heavy and well made, and the fifteen dollar price tag at the time of this review makes it an incredible bargain. If you could see one in person you'd be as impressed as I am.
555. I really like Persil, but I was expecting a original German product. It doesn't say it in their description, so I don't want to give 1 star, but I wish they would note somewhere that this is not original and is coming somewhere from eastern Europe. I can't even read the information on the package, especially for the fact that the price is expensive and I only paid so much since I expected original german product. I wonder now if it does wash the same way and as clean as the original?
556. I've had neck pain for years and lived on ibuprofen until I heard about Epsom IT. It works fast. My pain is gone in minutes and it lasts. No overwhelming odor and it isnt greasy.
557. Does what it says, My only complaint is it is not as accurate as syringe method. If you need exact amounts like I do, find something else.
558. Recommended by my dentist. Works great. Prevents my gums from bleeding.
559. This body wash smells wonderful. The foam makes it feel luxurious too.
560. Not sure why people are dissing this.  I only have one stainless steel appliance, a toaster. And with the trouble I had with that toaster looking awful I am very happy I don't have SS appliances. This toaster I was about to get rid of because the streaks on it drove me mad.  It worked fine and looked like heck.  I remember having seen this at Target back when I didn't own any SS item (except pans which BKF takes care of) and when I went looking for it out of desperation it wasn't there.  I have tried all manner of natural cleaners on that darn toaster, KD Gold which I use everywhere, the all purpose Method cleaners and even Windex.I finally found it at Whole Foods.  Initially was unhappy when I sprayed and just gave a quick wipe.  But then I felt it with my fingers and felt some sort of granules (for want of a better word) I grabbed a washcloth and rubbed it a bit.  Beautiful.I think this is akin to car polish or Jubilee, if you just swipe it you are going to have a mess.  But buff it just a bit and it is gorgeous.  And yes, it stays that way for quite awhile.Taking off one star for the lack of stressing to buff it a bit (directions do say to buff but I think they need to word it stronger)
561. Best way to try a variety of detergents! Amazon sample box plus credit toward your next detergent buy is smart, thx Amazon!
562. Quite an advantage when sitting for a prolonged period on hard surfaces.. Not really &#34;soft&#34; but adds a lot of comfort as your weight seems more distributed and hence the &#34;No-Pressure&#34;.  It is very portable and works on many surfaces. My wife sits on it when on a soft sofa and has significantly less lumbar pain. . I have been using 2 different types of the horse-shoe shaped chair cushions (with the sacral cutouts) for about 1 year  and find these to be amazing when sitting for long periods on a wooden chair.. but they are more rigid and do not quite distribute pressure like the purple... To be honest... I put the purple pad on the chair.... then the anatomically shaped butt cushion and together they are the ideal solution. Most comfortable sitting arrangement I have found ever.
563. Great product and reasonable price for the quality.
564. Great purchase
565. Love these. Pads help with pain on knees and hips.
566. Works great!
567. This is such a great value, 25 oz.  I have tried other ACV tonics which I liked a lot but this is very different.  I like that it is low carb, 3G per serving. Perfect for keto. This one was very different though, I think because of the fruits juices in the formula.  The flavor is really good although I have to dilute it a little with water because of the ACV strength.  I also like the potential health benefits of the other ingredients too. I will probably buy this again. Very happy with this product.
568. My 1st. Forearm Crutches...took to 'em like a Duck...water! More sexy than the Arm-Crotch Crutches (ACC). Strong, yet light. Shiny wcomfortable grips. AND, THEY ARRIVED IN 2 DAYS!  A Most Pleasant Shopping Experience, Indeed.
569. First - these contain soy. Which means I cannot touch them because I'm allergic to soy. The other folks on our hiking trip all tried them instead. Why is soy required???3 out 3 hated the chocolate crisp cereal bars. All agreed they smell ok, but taste awful. There's a bit of a bitter aftertaste and a distinctly chemical type flavor to the sweetness. It wasn't like a diet cola nasty, but bad enough that none of the 3 would eat more than a couple of bites one time. I can't give the remaining bars away.
570. It's kind of hard to mess up basic dish gloves. These are pretty standard gloves and they perform just as well as any others I've ever used. The center of the palm has slightly textured area to improve your trip on wet dishes. I'm allergic to latex and these did not cause any rash, hives, or redness and itching, so they seem to actually be latex free.
571. I'm a big fan of generic stuff, including tissues. UNTIL I actually have a cold and then I want the real deal - Kleenex. These are just softer and smoother with no shedding compared to the off brands. Sneezing or just a runny nose means lots of tissues and these do not make your nose sore. This 8 box batch means we can keep them handy in every room.
572. Meh. Who knows if these really do anything or not. There's no way to tell. My problem is with the fact that cranberry is way down in the middle of the ingredients and thus there's not much of it. I'll pass.
573. These glasses come in a nice, organized presentation with a case for each one. The frames are much better than you usually see in cheaters. They have solid screws and seem fairly sturdy. Of course, only time will tell if they live up to the first impressions. I love the colors in the set - blue, red and brown. I actually like the blue ones enough that I'm going have the lenses replaced with tinted sun glass lenses.
574. My husband travels a lot for work, including trans Pacific several times a year. He has tried and tossed out many travel pillows over the years for a variety of reasons. I thought this one might suit him.He doesn't like it. He says it's too thick and too stiff for his tastes. Plus he doesn't like material on the cover. However, all is not lost. I've found an alternative use for it. I'm using it as a support pillow for my right hip. I pulled a muscle last week (trying not to fall out my saddle when my young mare bolted over two jumps) and just sitting upright is excruciating.This is stiff and thick which wait very durable for sitting on. It doesn't give or sag and it returns to it's shape when put up. Since the cover is removable, I can wash it as needed. So....too hard for a neckhead pillow, but just right to support my injured hip.
575. I bought several of these Sample boxes from Amazon when they were offered and this Suds box was actually my favorite. The samples of the different laundry products &  dishwasher soaps was diverse and I actually found a couple of new things that I will start using regularly in the future. The rebate offered with the purchase of this box was very generous & I now have a much more effective dishwasher pod than before.
576. The Bounce Free & Gentle is the only dryer sheet I have found that both works and does not leave me with allergic hives. There are a couple of other scent or perfume free dryer sheets on the market, but they either leave your clothes staticky or stiff which defeats the purpose of using the things or you have to use more than one in each load which winds up costing more than the Bounce. These Bounce sheets are also good at pulling dog hair out of your dog bed covers in the dryer and I use them when doing a no-heat cycle for our saddle pads - I've never had a horse show any allergic response. Glad to have these available as a Prime Pantry option - though as of the time of this writing, the 120 count is the better value.
577. These wipes are nice & thick, they smell good also. An the price is good. I'm going to buy more because I always use wipes. An these are close to Cottonelle & Huggies  wipes. What I really like is that no white fuzz comes off the wipe. Buy these Wipes😊
578. Adheres and stays put
579. Makes nails smooth without the use of a dile.
580. I am not big on apple cider vinegar supplements, but my son likes them. These have a pretty strong vinegar scent when you open the bottle.Like many gummies, there is a lot of glucose to cover up the medicinal tastes, so be aware of that, especially if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic.The taste is pretty good once you chew on them. You don't really notice the vinegar much.As far as helpful, well, not sure there is any way to quantify that. My son says they help with his digestion. I do trust the Solger brand.
581. Well, I was not happy with this one.A large clipper and small clipper come packaged in a yellow tin. Presentation is about all this set has.There is a nice emery-type file on the back of the clipper. But the reason I do not like them is that they are not sharp, and don't cut the nail. Maybe I received a bad set. If so, they have quality-control issues. But I tried trimming a spot on one of my fingernails. It just chewed on it, never actually cutting it. I had to get out my own clippers and cut that nail shorter than I wanted to just to get rid of the snaggy spot these clippers created.Sorry, I cannot recommend these at any price.
582. I really don't see the big deal about these glass filers. They look neat, but they just quietly do their job. They come in a case to keep them from scratching other things or being scratched up.While they are listed as buffers, they are more of a nail file.Overall, functional, nice, but just another nail tool.
583. This was received at a great time, when greatly needed. I took the recommended 3-pill dose, and will see what happens, if anything.Day One - took 3 pills. Nothing.Day Two - took 4 pills.No results.Day Three, Day Four, Day Five.Nothing.So, have to conclude that these don't work for me. Your results may vary.
584. This supplement has a lot of very good ingredients. The dosage per day is two pills. They don't have a horrible smell, BUT...These are SO BIG!!  I have trouble swallowing pills at all, and the big ones are a struggle, if they even go down.I looked at the ingredients list. Everything is good, but honestly, I'd buy this supplement IF they just put the bottom half of the list in them. The top half can be had in so many multi vitamins that already exist. No need to duplicate those, when it is the bottom of the list I'd be interested in the most. The subsequent pill could then be smaller as well.Overall, not bad, but not worth it for a one-month supply that mostly duplicates a decent multivitamin.
585. This is not a super strong probiotic in comparison with some brands. But if this is just added to your daily routine as a backup, it is more than adequate.While it is nearly impossible to pinpoint or single out bodily benefits from one supplement, I can say these were reasonably easy to get down (I have trouble swallowing pills, so take them with food). I did not notice any heartburn or taste kickback from these either.The only beefs were that the fresh date was only five months out, and that Amazon put their sticker over the ingredients listamounts.Seems to be a quality supplement.
586. Well, I've been trying out various protein shakes to try and have something readilyavailable for meal replacements.  Thanks to some mobility problems, I can't get to the refrigeratorwhen I get hungry, so having something available where I am was important.We've tried several flavors of Spiru-tein shakes now.  We got various packets,and got a whole can of the egg nog.  If you like the egg nog that comes in the wax cartonslike a quart of milk during the holidays, then you will like this one.I needed something that would mix well and taste okay with WATER, not milk, as I cannotget to the milk. We tried this one both ways, and I love it both ways!The milk made it taste like a creamy cup of rich eggnog from a carton - definitely not like a diet shake.The water made a very tasty version also - I use a shaker with a blender ball (vs a blender),and very cold water. I shook it like crazy, then let it sit for a minute.  It mixes very easily,and I had no problems at all with the shaker. The result was a super creamy shake, thick enough todrink with a straw if desired. It has a nice nutmeg aftertaste. The color is eggnog yellow (why mentioncolor? Some of Spiru-tein's shakes have some funky colors!), and totally acceptable. It coated the blender cup as well.The only downside, if you can say there is one, is that it uses fructose as a sweetener. I preferstevia myself.  At least it is not aspartame, which would be a deal breaker. It uses only ONE scoopper 8 ounces of liquid, and has 120 calories, 14 grams of protein and 15 grams of carb (making it a littlebit on the high side of the carb). However, it also has choline and inositol in this flavor, which addsto the fat burning potential.I don't drink this to bulk up, rejuvenate after lifting weights, or any of the athletic uses.I am using protein shakes as meal replacements to help shed some weight. So, the relatively lowerprotein (compared to the muscle shakes) suits me just fine.They say this is a holiday edition.  They need to offer it year-round. It is fantastic!A definite favorite in our house, with six thumbs up.We'll definitely buy this one again!
587. We tried this on the sample size.We mixed it with 2% milk, so that will affect the flavor results, I am sure.We used one of our shakers, not a blender (no need with Spiru-tein mixes unlessyou really want to). The powder is tan, and doesn't smell like cookies in any way.What I DIDN'T like about this flavor was the little bits of cookie. I don't know, butI don't want chunks in a liquid drink! A blizzard has chunks of cookies, but you eat thosewith a spoon. This you drink, so the little cookies chunks are a little weird on the tongue.However, it isn't the worst flavor. I thought there would be more cookie dough flavor, butit is more like melted ice cream with bits of a chocolate chip cookie (not the chip part,but the actual cookie part) mixed in. It adds crunch to the drink.I really did not like having chunks of things that needed to be chewed when I wastrying to drink a liquid shake. I would imagine that you could mix this up and freeze it,and have a very healthy and tasty frozen snack, but we have not tried that.Not the worst tasting mix out there, for sure, and it has a nice load of vitamins.The weird texture mix caused it to lose a star, down to only two. It doesn't taste "bad",but hated the cookies on my tongue.Would I buy it again?  No, I definitely would not.I love Spiru-tein products, but not this flavor.
588. Quality product.
589. Works really well.
590. These are ... OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I like the leather, but that's about all that distinguishes these from other similar products, and frankly, I like some of the other Dr. Scholl's insoles much better in terms of comfort.I tried them in two different pairs of shoes.  Yes, the bottom of the insole is &#34;sticky,&#34; but it's more &#34;tacky&#34; than &#34;sticky,&#34; and I think the purpose is to keep the insole from shifting position.  I had no trouble moving them from one pair to the other.  I first tried them on an older pair of high-end flats that are almost past their expiration date.  Noticed a little more &#34;squishy&#34; feeling, but other than that, nothing.  Moved them to an el cheapo pair of flats with almost no cushioning in the soles.  Again, a slight feeling of &#34;squishiness,&#34; but nothing that I'd say was praise-worthy.For me, then, they're OK.  Nothing great, nothing really wrong with them.  They just didn't make enough of a difference for me to recommend them enthusiastically.  3 stars ...
591. Much prettier than I expected.  The foil printing is crisp and clear, and the bag is constructed of heavyweight paper -- almost card stock weight.  The tiehandle is a nice quality sheer ribbon the same color as the background (a beigetan).  Everything is strong and well constructed.  Really really nice.  The bag really dresses up a bottle of wine (I used one today to take a bottle of wine to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house).
592. Very disappointed. Would not hold liquid. The opening kept popping open. Woke up two mornings with an empty brush. Would not recommend. Went back to an Oxo brand brush with a screw on dispenser.
593. These cut fingernails really well. Nice and sharp cuts. The only negative is the nail flyaways. We all know that there are nail cutters out there that have a piece attached that captures the cuttings. This does not. So, expect to have to clean cuttings off the floor.These are high quality fingernail cutters.
594. I did not like the feeling of these straws on my tongue. They're not perfectly smooth. I'm not going to use these straws.
595. Great bags...much better quality than most of the plastic bags used at grocery stores.If you want those grocery store style plastic bags, these are the ones to buy. I say spend the extra money for the better quality.
596. The stool is very easy to assemble. It rolls very easily over either floors or carpets. The cushion is comfy. I read some reviews complaining of its longevity. I hope mine holds up for a long time.
597. This is the second time am buying this product and it works. I've definitely seen an increase in my supply
598. We have a cat who needs to take half of a very tiny pill twice a day. This worked great to split the pills in half.
599. These delightful brittle - do I call them a candy or a cookie - are different and tasty.  Only problem is I want to eat the whole bag at one time.  I prefer the chocolate chip to the other flavors, but I'm sure that's a preference and not a reflection on the product.
600. This cup mixes powdered drinks well.
601. Fits great, looks nice and great price!
602. Update: HAIR LOSS!  Took 6 mos off these to slow loss & I've still not regained lost hair.Update: After nearly a year - I am not losing as much hair.Yes I sleep better but using very good magnesium at bedtime too. Plus melatonin. What concerns me is not knowing what iron, selenium ETC are in here. I contacted company and they said many people take extra minerals to be SURE they get enough. Yikes!
603. They use intesinal binding fillers - maybe that's why no full label I.E.> ingred's shown. My glands swell, cannot swallow and I lose fingernails if ingest Magnesium Stearate. It is NOT benign.
604. I had to stop taking it - had reaction like I do when FILLERS are used.
605. Good valueprice for glass cleaners.
606. The picture on this is currently, a safety belt. It has nothing to do with these gel padsI wear CPAP full face mask. Somehow, it rubbed a pressure ulcer in the bridge of my nose. It was painful and horrible. I ordered these, put them together to make them thick. I would put anti-bacterial gel on it, cover it with a bandaid, add the gel pads and put my mask on. These were life savers. The ulcer has healed (hopefully putting vitamin e on it will help reduce scarring) and I feel much better about everything. i would not be without these again.....EVER!
607. These things are great. They are super absorbent. The colors go with nearly everything. If you have a child who can chew through a car tire, these might not work but these will work for many kids who are aggressive chewers.I am quite happy with them and cannot recommend them highly enough but like I said, some autistic kids may through these so I guess you will have to take your chances when ordering but for many kids, they will do the trick. The cloth is soothing to bite, they do not look odd and it will save shirts.
608. the size said it would fit a size 10 (which i am) but these were to small, they were tight i didn't use them. they were cheaply made Dr. Scholls could have made something more comfortable.
609. 3 months in and it bricked.  Was good while it lasted, but it didn't last.  Avoid.
610. As my other reviews state, benzoyl peroxide is benzoyl peroxide no matter the brand. This is an absurd deal and will last you years for less than the price of one tube anywhere hands down.
611. Great price for 3 pill organizers. The compartments snap tightly closed, so it would good to throw in a purse.  It is smaller than many week pill organizers and I like that the days of the week are raised and not printed.  Those that have printed words seem to wear off quickly.  The compartments are large enough to hold the 8 pills that I take, including 2 glucosamine and one metformin that are fairly large.  My other pills are small.  There would be room for a few more.  The length is 5-18&#34;, width 1-38&#34; and height 1&#34;.  It is easy to fill it as all the compartments can be open at once, unlike my round case, where they open a small amount if the other days' spaces are open.
612. It's fine. I have my preferences over this. This is a nice blend of various collagen sources (bovine, marine, poultry, eggshell) and therefore a wider degree of collagen types (1, 2, 3, 5, 10). Hence the elevated price tag (I don't rate on price, but I will comment that it should be compared to others of this ilk. It is with similar price range). Some sources are more expensive. Some sources don't require as much to be effective. Ie, bovine is cheapest, but needs more, marine is usually most expensive yet needs a lot less. This has a good amount, well fair amount, per serving at about 8 grams of collagen peptides (hydrolyzed- meaning it is broken down to readily absorbable, easily digestible form, and it mixes in hot or cold without gelling).Multi forms can impart a slight smell and flavor. I think the ones that use eggshell tend to have a little extra aroma. May disappear depending on what it is being used in. Or might be noticeable. Not a big fan of it in my plain black unsweetened coffee, but is totally fine in a smoothie, or when I have a coffee that I doctor up with cream and flavor syrup. I dont fault the brand, as it is merely a facet of the composition. I will always used collagen, often single source, but will pepper in multi source as I see fit.This is a perfectly fine product. Though I recommend that they actually include a picture of the nutritional information. We dont need to see half a dozen pictures of people drinking it. Let us know what is in it. Had I been shopping around for it, I would have passed this over for a listing that tells me all that I am getting.Though I am pleased to see this:"If you’re not 100% satisfied with your purchase, we’ll issue you a refund."
613. Nice natural lavender scent. Does not smell synthetic at all. I have tried a few fragrance options by Kate Naturals. They are all as natural as can be. They smell nice, dont trigger headaches. I love the whiff of fresh smelling lavender (and orange, and peppermint), but they dont linger long, and I have had bottle issues. So far so good on this one, but we'll see. I had to downrate my orange one from 4 to 1 star because the bottle stopped working after a week. I will update here if I experience that with this. I think they make for a very good "before you go" bathroom spray. Also nice for general use, but I find them very effective for that purpose. Also works in a pinch to freshen up clothes, shoe closet, etc.
614. In short: open reservoir cup makes it easy to add water, keep clean, and to allow dry between uses. Can adjust strength. Slim design makes it easy to maneuver around mouth. Takes up little room. Can be packed up for on the go use. Loud, but similar to my corded tank style.I use water flossers all the time. The best (to me) is a particular name brand that has a tank, and is plugged in. I keep that in my main bathroom that has a plug nearby. Since I rely greatly on water flossing, I wanted to have one in my 1st floor bathroom, which is like the size of a closet, and has no counter, and no plugs. So, I have been tried cordless flossers for use in that bathroom.Here is the thing I find with most of them: the water reservoirs are bulky and are hard to clean. I dont care that they dont hold much water. That is easy enough to deal with, but to have an enclosed cup that really can ever be cleaned out? gross. Then I tried one where there , and that works really well for my needs. That one wins out over this due to one aspect- it is fully cordless. When I saw this Hangsun water flosser I decided to try it--it has appearance of regular plug in, but an open water top that makes me feel better about it drying between uses. I didnt need another flosser, but I wanted to find out more about it and report back in a review.SO, this may be for you if you are (like me) in wanting a CORDLESS* flosser with an open water reservoir. I can easily add more water to it, it is easy to clean, and it dries between uses. Charge has been long lasting, so I like that I dont need to fuss. It is nice for use in no-plug areas. While cordless, I still feel attached, as I need to set the base down. Doubt I would use this in shower. With my other one, I may need to supply my own cup for water, but it can be any size, and I can use it in shower just by cupping my hand.Kinda loud-- similar to my plug in name brand one.I tend to only ever use one head- the slightly curved one. Havent tried the other options, and likely wont.Of the half dozen cordless flossers I have tried (including a name brand cordless), I like this one, and the one I linked to the best. I use them secondary to my plug in.
615. Chocolatey, but not chocolate milk (I despise chocolate milk). Flavor reminds me of the inside of a 3musketeers candy bar. Liquify that, keep it thick, and that is what it makes me think of. It is really thick, could easily water it down (or use milk of choice), or add to blender with some ice and get something that tastes much like a milk shake (or Frosty, reminds me of a frosty when I do that).Not a "low calorie food, but is within the norm for drinks and powders of this ilk. I love meal replacement drinks over plain protein as the added vitamins, minerals, and fiber make me feel better than protein alone.  I make smoothies and use prefab nutrition drinks like this as a means to get something in my body when I dont feel like eating. I often dont have an appetite until half way through my day, but I will feel some low level hunger, and I know I need something to power me through my physical work day. So a simple smoothie usually works (and allows me to add in other supplements such as collagen, mushroom powder). That being said, at some point I am never quite satisfied with a liquid meal, but still dont want a meal. So I usually add in a few nibbles of something, whether it be fruit, veg, cheese stick, snack bar, etc.Works great as a snack, or even as a "dessert"Sweetened primarily with allulose, and finishes with some sucralose (Splenda!). I dont really have an opinion on either sweetener. I find both are very sweet, without an aftertaste, and I dont have digestive issues from it.Pack of six, 32 ounce bottles which contain 4 (8 ounce) servings (all told same as a pack of 24 bottles at 8 ounces each). I like the option of it having a few servings worth in one big bottle as it cuts down on packaging. But it also reduces my ability to just grab and go. However, they do carry these in other sizes!Price per ounce is very similar to others with blood glucose support in mind.I have to say, I didnt know what to expect. With my first sip, I was impressed with taste, texture, and how there was no odd taste or funny after taste. Really quite pleasing flavor. The extra thick texture makes it versatile. Thick makes it feel like a shake, and triggers belly into thinking there is something in there. But it also allows for it to be watered down some if you want something to sip.I'm impressed, and would recommend this. Of course, take a look at ingredients and decide if it is good for your needs.
616. Not my first "real silk" sleep mask. In short: Light, breathable, not hot, blocks light, good adjustable fit, super silky, doesn't dehydrate skin, is gentle on skin- no rubbing, dragging. Cozy plush feel. Good stitching, nicely packaged.I rate this primarily on my experience. I dont factor price in. Prices fluctuate, there are coupons, everyone has different budgets, preferences, and so on. You decide if it is worth it. This is actual silk and there is a price tag that goes with it. Not everyone wants a polyester dupe. Not everyone wants low level silk (that feels like polyester). If you have no preference, then there are some lovely low level momme silk options, as well as some nice polyester satin options for fraction of price. This is for those that want actual silk (RIP silkworms).  That being said, I have used a wide variety of eye masks of different materials and styles. Here is my take on this:It feels light and lush. Very soft and silky. I am privvy to the look, feel, performance of various textiles including various silk levels. This is 25 momm and feels like it. I dont question that at all.Silk is nice for any skin, but is particularly gentle on delicate skin or skin easily irritated. It is breathable, and it doesnt dehydrate already dry skin. I notice that my skin is less parched when I use silk versus low end polyester. That is material that is smashed up against my skin for 8 hours each night. I would prefer to not have material that is rough and drags against my skin. Same can be said for pillow cases and my hair. Though I do keep other styles at my bedside, I always come back to silk.  I happened to be in need of another real silk mask because I accidentally washed and dried my trusty silk mask and it shrunk significantly (note to self: hand wash, air dry.).The fit is good for me. Generous size which is nice for my wide face and big nose. Plenty of elastic and the adjustment option allows it to be as loose or snug as I desire. I find that it blocks light from every angle. I normally dont mind a little light to seep through so long as I dont notice while my eyes are closed. But this blocks it all out for me. I had to lift an edge to see if the tv was still on (my hubs will watch tv in bed with sound offcaptions on). I couldnt tell. Come morning, I pushed the mask up a little so as not to accidentally sleep all day.Not hot. Some masks really trap heat. This is breathable. Again, function of the material used. Of course any material can block light. So it comes down to your needs and preferences.Nicely packagedAt time of review, this was $35 with 30% coupon. While I dont rate on price (except for in the rate features section, which I give 3 stars), I will comment that $35 is the ceiling for nearly all 22-25 momme silk eye masks. If you can get it in the 20 something range, then that is reasonable.
617. Surprisingly neutral tasting considering all the green ingredients, easy to drink flavor. It is designed to be added to a smoothie, not for use as a smoothie itself. But I wanted to get an idea of the overall taste, so I blended 1 TBS with 8 unsweetened almond milk and it really just disappeared- not much flavor, which I find to be a good thing. I really was expecting it to taste awful, lolIt has some erythritol- 4.5 grams per 1 TBS serving. I missed this when looking at the ingredients because it is not listed in the ingredients. Just in the nutrition panel. I could do without it, but it doesnt overpower at all. I find that when products use non sugar sweeteners they go way overboard with the sweetness. This doesnt impart much sweetness or much of any strong flavor.1 TBS has 110 calories, so be mindful of how much you use. Hence why it is best added TO a smoothie (or whatever else you want).I like all the food based ingredients and I "feel good" adding this to my assortment of supplements I add to my daily smoothie. Nice way to boost my nutrition since I have not been consuming as much fresh food as I should (lack of availability, super high prices).I'd get this again 4.5 stars  (5 stars, since I like it more than 4)
618. How this fits into your life depends on what you need. It still requires some water, and still requires toweling off. It basically replaces the need to have a separate low suds cleansing formula and wash rag or dry cloth. THIS IS Rinse free, but you do need water to start.  Just add a little water to the sheet of fabric, massage for light lather, wipe down body, then towel off. No need to rinse. Keep in mind that the more water that is used, the more the mess from run off.The sheet of fabric is like a soft piece of felt. Size of a large washcloth (9.5" x 9.5"). Don't need much water! It definitely lathers. It isn't a sudsy soap, but that doesn't mean there isn't enough.  Now, if you are expecting loads of foamy bubbles, this does not provide that. It creates a light watery lather. This in no way determines effectiveness of cleaning. Mega lather does not equate better cleaning. I learned that 30 some years ago in home economics that excess lather is a marketing technique (usually through copious amounts of sulphates) to give people impression that more latherbubblessuds = better clean (shampoo, body soaps, toothpaste). But for those that dig the suds, I can get some light bubbles out of it. That being said, it is adequate enough. Not super refreshing, but I do feel clean. Tried it in hair with fair results.This could be cut in half and it would still have plenty of lather. Depending on your situation, this could be premoistened and placed in a ziplock baggie.No discernable aroma. Not sticky, at least not me. I wonder if amount of water used, or thoroughness of toweling off impacts that or not.Personally, I prefer wet body wipes. They never need water nor toweling off. I like those for on the go use (workday, after work out, bird bath at the sink). I would be more apt to use these in a bed bound situation, or no hot water situation, maybe camping.The term "waterless" needs to be taken out from the title headline. That is a traffic directing manipulation, and it helps no one especially if they buy something like this without further looking at the product pictures and description.
619. Large, engraved, unsealed blond pinewood disc. Natural, earthy, simple. Very appropriate for a dowsing board. I like the graphics on it (butterfly, moon phases, etc). They also have a black option, which appears stunning.Lightweight, but sturdy.. just add your own pendulum.
620. I like it 3.5 to 4 stars. (I like it more than middle of road 3 rating)I keep a selection of instant coffee on hand for at home and on the go. I sometimes add it to smoothies, sometimes I make a quick iced drink (shaken), sometimes I just want a very quick cup of coffee and the taste of instant can be pleasing to me. More often, I add it to a cup of brewed coffee. Get an extra boost (flavor, caffeine)!  And that is primarily how I drink this. I make myself a cup of dark bold coffee, blend a packet of this in, and enjoy. I like the light vanilla taste, and the sweetness level is on point for me. I dont often sweeten my coffee as I prefer it black, but I do enjoy some sweetened coffee with cream on occasion.Prepared as is? The sweetness level is more pronounced, as is the vanilla. Wish "no sugar added" products that use sugar alternatives would use less. So made alone is a tad much for me. I like that it is super quick and easy to make, can be made with hot or cold water, and is well packaged. I like the added supplements. The amount of collagen peptides is low (3 grams), where my typical scoop of collagen powder always offers 10+ grams per serving.You decide. It uses SUCRALOSE as its sweetener. I have found it used in "keto" products, but I also see many keto products omitting it and using something else. I am not on a strict keto diet, nor any keto diet. I am just reducing my sugar intake, and by doing so I tend to buy things that end up using sucralose. SO FAR, I have not had any issue with weight loss. It is October as I write this, and I have dropped 50 lbs since April, and I haven't tried all that hard. Just dropped sugar laden desserts and have been moving more. Maybe my weight loss would be further along, but I still take down half a pizza every week. But massive calorie reduction from dropping desserts, and using sugar free alternatives.. which happens to include sucralose. I'd like to see less of it used across the board, but in mean time it doesn't seem to be a hinderance to my health and goals.I do not rate on price as we all have different budgets, needs, interests. The price is posted, and not a surprise, so I just focus on my experience and perception of taste, quality, and how it lines up to the product description. THOUGH, I do comment.. and this really is ridiculously priced. I have some good instant coffee products with similar nutrition profile where each pack is in the upper $1 range (and people still freak over price). So for me, this is a bit prohibitive for daily use, but that is just me and my budget.The packaging is cool though. Might make for a nice addition to a food or coffee or keto themed gift basket. Nice looking packets tucked into a tray with a slide on cover. Then it is wrapped in plastic. Has a retail look to it.
621. I'm sorry to say that my bottle arrives busted, and therefor I couldn't really use it. I sopped up some of the loose liquid and worked it into a stone floor. I knew exactly what I was planning to use this on, so I got straight to it. I just have one spot in my late 30s, early 40s Sears kit home that has an unsealed rough stone floor. I have been wanting to find something that could clean that floor. Nothing ever describes what I have, so I have been reticent to buy anything. So I haven't used anything! When I saw that this product can be used on pavers, bricks, sidewalks, etc I figured that was much closer to what I have in terms of porosity. So here I am with a busted bottle, and just a rags worth of product, and I dab it onto one spot. It really seems promising. This isnt a case of "oh, I can use anything".. and I certainly cant use a power washer. Hm, maybe a steamer.. but yeh, I need a cleaner. This could be it, but I dont have enough to work with. I am highly considering just buying another bottle (but concerned about another broken bottle). Personally, I think the price point is reasonable, hence why I never rate on price. IF I do buy another bottle (currently have one sitting in my cart) I will be back to update.
622. Pretty good! Helps keep my sanity when I get hungry before my main meal.  I think it makes for a quick snack- either to take care of a sweet tooth need, or just need something to nosh on to take care of hungries before next meal. When I am on the go all day, I often dont eat anything until dinner (Im just not hungry, and copious amounts of coffee andor a smoothie takes care of my need to masticate a meal), but.. sometimes I do get a little hungry. OK, sometimes a lot. lol.  I pack some snack bars just in case, but sometimes I want a better mouth feeldifferent texture than what a dry bar provides. SO give me cheese stick, olives, meat stick.. and now these yam sticks. Of all the other options, these are the easiest for me as they are room temperature stable. Now I can have one of these and maybe a handful of nuts, and I am satisfied enough to hold off until dinner.Has a light, mild taste. I think kids would like this as it isnt as strong as some sweet potatoes. I know some of the flavor is dependent on the type of sweet potatoyam used, and region. That is the extent of my expertise, though haha. The texture is decent. It is a soft with a little bit of chew. Easy to eat. I have another yam product I prefer (about as mild, but little more chew), but I would totally buy these again. If only because I can control myself better. This is 80 calories per stick, where as the other is a bag at 180 per servingbag. Not bad, but I dont always need that much at once (but I cant control myself haha). So different items purchased for different reasons. If you want to get fancy, this would be delightful paired with a slice of turkey or chicken, then maybe a slice of cheese all rolled in a small soft tortilla shell. Or ditch the meat, and add in avocado. Hmm, making myself hungry now.Yammy: https:www.amazon.comdpB08SYBSSN3
623. I have tried these in a few pairs of shoes, all of which range from 10 to 11 womens, so I chose the sizing option of 10-11.5 women (or 8.5-10) men's. The sizing seems spot on. As with many inserts, there is a guideline on the bottom for trimming to size. I did not find these too wide for the shoe. They are the exact same as other inserts I stacked them against. I literally pulled inserts out from other shoes and put these on top. I took a couple of pics side by side, as trying to show the sameness by putting them on top of each other doesn't show anything.. because they are same size! Excused the um, wear and tear on the used inserts ;)The inserts feel pretty good. Not super cushiony, but I do feel a pleasant energizing tingle when I wear them, especially in the heel. I have high arches, so I appreciate that these dont have a super firm arch. It feels reasonable to me.The inserts do feel breathable and "not stuffy". I really wasn't sure what to expect because the description mentions heat, walking fever.. I have no idea. The brandstore name is EarthingLife, so who knows.. not really my thing. I just want decent inserts, and the price is within range of what I normally pay ($10-17).4 stars.. still early on in wearing these. Been wearing them light duty, but I want to see how they do with a full, physical work week. I will update if I learn more, or fall in love with them, etc..
624. --Very clingy- truly grabs onto whatever it is being wrapped aroundonto; including itself. Be careful!--The material is thin. I have used other compostable cling wrap, and this is the thinnest I have used.--Comes with a slider cutter that you have to attach to box for use in cutting sheets of wrap.--A little tricky to dispense & cut.  Once I got a piece off the roll, I was able to effectively wrap some food. It was while it is still on the roll and trying to get some off that is slightly problematic for me. Perhaps with more use I will get the hand of it.-- If you can get a whole sheet off, then know that whatever you wrap, this will provide a good seal.I find that the compostable wrap is much more clingy than regular cling wraps, and for that I will likely continue with buying compostable cling wrap. This is about what I expected, and works pretty well. However,  I prefer this brand: https:www.amazon.comdpB08XVSWFZ2(more pricy though).3.5-4 stars
625.  These really aren't too shabby. The cleaning sheets are as expected--I read through the product description before ordering.  I think I have used something similar in the past as it felt rather intuitive to use. Just add a sheet to water, it instantly dissolves. I think 1 sheet per gallon, give or take. Can be stuffed into a cleaning bottle for a spray solution, or can be added to a bucket. Smells nice, works well. Small pressure zip plastic packaging. Little footprint. Really no waste.I have used it primarily on counter tops and tubs. While it mentions floors and walls, I just use it as a basic cleaner--seems gentle enough. My rag picks up a lot of dirt, so I know it is effective. Current price of $5 for 30 sheets makes this a budget friendly option, especially if looking for something that doesn't take up much space, or plan to use it in a spray bottle. Of course, there are liquid concentrates that would offer same. But hey, I thought it worth pointing out.I really think it is an ok product!Lack of directions is a concern, though. I dont mind information in another language other than English. If I can't figure it out, then using a translator app, I pass my phone over it.  Odd thing is, there aren't any instructions. The most info you get on this product is what you see here on the product page. There is no workable information printed on the package. So I dont down rate because of the info not being in English, I down rate because there simply is no info! I will include a picture of the translated text. But even so, I think nearly anyone couldshould be able to figure this product out."Water-Soluble Cleaning Sheet: Concentrated cleaning sheet will quickly dissolves upon contact with water and is immediately ready for your cleanup job"I DO  like these cleaning sheets. I clean homes for a living, and while I dont always need my own cleaners, I do keep a few in my tool kit. Having the option of mixing something up on the go, and having no added weight or mess to carry around is highly appealing.  I would even tear off half a sheet and add it directly to a toilet. It does dissolve instantly, easily, and smells good and fresh. Not too strong. No need to rinse.lovely product, overall. 4 stars
626. Bought this more for the scent profile than the "germ fighter" aspect. I saw that it was fine for use around pets when used as directed, which is also why I was keen on getting it. I have 2 labs and 3 cats, so it is important that I use products that are not going to harm them. I like freshening up my carpet, so I figured I would give this a try.For pet owners:  Sprinkle on carpets, wait 15 minutes, vacuum. THEN keep pets off of carpet for an additional 30 minutes after that. I didnt realize that second part is needed until I read the directions. I failed to see that when I was looking at the product description. It is there. So just know to add in the additional time.It smells really good. Very fine particulates. Be sure to follow directions with pets. For added precaution, I am using this in  areas that are well ventilated and not in direct sleeping spots.
627. For a basic eye mask of this style, it is attractive, budget friendly, and are well made. Blocks out light via not only the outer material but also an internal piece of flannel stitched in. I'm not sure why it has a pocket. Nothing to come out. Perhaps to add your own additional padding or black out material? No idea.Not adjustable, but there is a lot of stretch. How loose or tight this fits depends on your head. I think it would be easy enough to make an adjustment to smaller size with a couple of quick stitches (and I am not one to sew).  I like that it isn't adjustable because usually the adjustable part snags my hair, or I can feel it against my head.However, it being a little large to start is good because I have a large head. My head measures 23.75", this fits me without feeling too snug. Most feel way too snug. But at some point in night I didnt like the feel. Not sure why yet.Material is nice, stitching is good, comfortable when first on. Over course of night I could feel some pressure. I eventually took it off. I think these will be used for the occasional nap or when I need to just rest my eyes. For me, I think the pressure is due to the use of slim elastic AND the opening to that pocket area. I can just feel it at some point. Most all eye masks use slim elastic and what it does (for me) is create pressure across eye area where it pulls on the material through there. But since this isn't too snug feeling, I think it has more to do with that crease where the pocket it. More material to smash against my face.So initially comfortable but then turns uncomfortable. Your experience may vary.Quality overall seems fine. Love the 3 pack. Love the floral design of the ones I selected. It just isn't quite for me, sadly. I'll try it a few more times. If I experience anything else, I will let you know. In the mean time these are just "OK". Hence 3 starsOddly, my favorite sleep mask is one that no one else seems to like, lol. I keep waiting for it to come back so I can buy another, or maybe I will figure out a way to make one for myself. I am linking it in case you too have a big head and are bothered by the pressure of the slim elastic. Or at very least can see what I mean by largewide elastic.https:www.amazon.comdpB07RJQGV61
628. I have high arches, but have some shoes without any sort of support, and so I find slipping in a support like this can help for long term wearing of super flat shoes. The appeal of these for me is that due to my high arches and the fact that these come with "height adjustment" padded pieces, I can be sure to create a level of fit and support that is good for my feet. These are cut to fit, and have additional padding pieces to make for better adjustment in fit, feel, and support. They fit well in shoes, sneakers, boots.. and do well staying in place. I will consider buying these again.
629. Overall I am impressed with the effectiveness of these s they are intended. Silky waterproof like material on one side, and soft fleecy material on the other. They are meant for "low flow"-- which I am really only most comfortable with using it for very light days, so please keep that in mind. I always wear a liner for various reasons. I am using these for that purpose. They do not leak, there is no odor that I have notices, and the material is so soft and comfortable. My lady bits like the fleecy feel. When done I toss it in the wash or hand wash depending on what I feel like.While the liners stayed put in a manner that kept me covered,  do notice some shifting. I am larger in size, so underwear is larger.. and it seems that these were quite loose. I think a second button snap right along the first to make more narrow, andor a second set to also help keep it in place. Right now it is one snap, loose fit. It may not be limited to these, this may be the norm? This is my first experience with reusable cloths. I really like the idea, and while I am not ready to fully swap out, I can comfortable using these in place of my daily liner. Or paired with a resuable menstrual cup. But for flow? I am not there yet in terms of confidence.
630. This will fit large heads. I have a 23.75" head, and this has plenty of stretch and adjustability. It can easily go larger than my head measurements.The soft foam cups are comfortable. The exact fit will vary. I find they block out all the light, and unless I am resting my head in such a way to push on them, there is very little light that will sneak through. I'm a side sleeper.The soft foam cups allow the eyes to breathe, lashes don't get smashed. Eye creams likely stay in place.Although stretchy and adjustable, it is hard for me to find that sweet spot where it isn't too snug that it creates creases come morning, nor too loose that it doesn't fall off, migrate away from my eyes. I found the snug fit worked better as it kept the mask from rotating in the night (and off my eyes), BUT I wake with indents. I can't have that.Other aspect that has troubled me is that sometimes it gets caught in my hair. The spot that has the adjustment hardware is prone to snagging my hair.SO, I go back to my old trust stand by which is a tube of material. It looks like a headband, and it continues to be my most favorite sleep mask of all time. If it rotates, it doesn't matter because it is a tube so I am always covered,  I have been using nightly since I got it 6 months ago.www.amazon.comdpB07RJQGV61This one by Cyraneme is a close second, though. Comfort, quality, adjustability, and the fact that it can actually fit large heads are all positives in my opinion. The rotation and the indents (and hair snag) is variable. Depends on if I can find that sweet spot for fit. I definitely have tried other sleep masks that I never used ever again. This I will use. It is still at my bed side.
631. Gift worthy set-comes with long back length silicone scrubber, a hand scrubber poof, a shower cap, and a set of hooks. All packed into a small box. Would make for a great stocking stuffer or as part of a themed self care gift.  I may pick up another set for this reason.Everything is of good quality. I am extra impressed with the hand scrubber loofahpoof. It is rather robust. The longer silicone scrubber takes some getting used to. I have really come around to silicone scrubbers, as they just seem more hygienic to me. And even if you dont use bath wash on it (I often soap up my body, then run this over it), it is lovely on the skin. Gentle, but effective. The shower cap is a nice addition. Use it in or out of shower.No problems with this set. I think it is a great bundle of shower items. If I experience anything else, I will be back to update,.
632. I have been enjoying this little Sonic face cleansing gadget. I haven't any prior experience to these (facial cleansing brushes always seemed to be spinning style, and I didn't not want that style) but I pretty much knew what to expect, and understand how it works. The soft silicone surface is the cleaning brush area, and it is static. Vibration behind it gives action to the silicone bristles and it gently provides cleansing power. There are multiple vibration options with a short press of a button (long press to hold on). Auto memory features remembers your last setting.As with ANY skin cleansing brush, if you have a face full of make up plan to remove it with a cloth first (the idea being that bristles and massage could work it down into pores? Your  experience, school of thought may vary).There is no need to press hard against skin, just let it glide. I use small gentle circles over a wet face slathered in skin cleanser. I don't wear much in make up but I always wear sunscreen and other layers of skin care. I often double cleanse because of this. Usually an oily balm followed by a cream cleanser (I have dry skin). For this, I have been skipping the first cleanse with an oil balm and just using the cream cleanser-- figured for testing purposes to keep it the same for several uses.And no, it doesn't create lather, bubbles.. it isn't a circulating brush. Stationary silicone brush with vibration behind it. But it cleans! I thought, well is it just a hand held soft scrubber? How could it be better than a wash cloth? It is so much better than a wash cloth. And so much more gentle. And more hygienic.Maybe other kinds are better, but I can only tell you my experience and thoughts on THIS "AVJONE Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush"-- and is a budget friendly option too.Maybe it will vary among users, but my skin felt and looked clean. Not only that, but I have been really enjoying the experience of using it. My night time skin care routine in particular is a sacred time. I aim to enjoy it rather than see it as a chore. So I enjoy using more pamper worthy products, tools, hair bands, etc. Me time. And, this has added to my experience. It is.. relaxing. The whether I use the vibration at lowest setting, or highest, it has a calming sensation. I use it on face, neck, and chest.  The recommended time for cleaning is 1 minute, and it will turn off after 3. I go almost the full 3 since I am adding in my neck and chest--and I am taking it slowly. No scrubbing, rubbing, or pressure. Just gentle circles around skin.My cleanser is massaged in, it is moved around a little (the nubs don't move in circles, there is a vibration under them), and then when all done I rinse my face and it looks so.. fresh, bright, clean. I feelsee no traces left behind of sunscreen. The lotion was effectively broken down by this. It is a notable difference from hand washing, or washing with a washcloth.So for me, it works. I AM enjoying this.The small device is comfortable in hand. Easy to use. I like the base that it sits on. There is a small hole for DRAINAGE.  I rinse off the device after each use, but don't dry it off, so I like that it sit up perfectly in this base.I really have come to like and appreciate silicone for use in cleaning my face and body. Seems so much more hygienic.The charger is usb on one end and a magnetic attachment at the device. Mine came charged, and so other than an initial plug-in to make sure it worked, I haven't had to charge it any. I have used it 5 nights now, each night for 2-3 minutes at a time. (debating on whether I canshould use it nightly or not). Charger may feel hot to touch, and is normal. Do NOT charge for more than 24 hours.When I do have to finally get around to charging it, I will just have to lay it on a wash cloth or counter top. The base is not for setting device in while charging. I suppose maybe one day they could redesign the base to include both a drainage hole and a charging portPS. The direction state NOT to use it with clay-based cleansers, silicone-based or granular based cleansers, exfoliating creams or scrubs.Use cream cleansers, oil cleansers, water based cleansers. The usual-- just not something that could damage silicone, andor create too much(combined) friction on face.That's it! I like it. As I use it more, if I experience anything worth sharing, I will be back to update.
633. I am a big fan of hydrating toners, especially Korean brands. They do not contain drying alcohols nor is it astringent. They are for helping to increase hydration, skin plumpness, gentle toning, and to prepare skin for the next steps.  I tend to apply multiple layers (ala "7 skin" method) adding some to the palm of my hands then patting it on. I do this a few times with several seconds in between. I know when my skin is hydrated enough once the product doesn't seem to soak in any more. Then I follow up with usually a serum and moisturizer (or SPF if using during day).My skin enjoys a whole host of different toners I have used over the years. Most are good enough, some are pretty great, and I was pleasantly surprised that this toner is rather fantastic for my dry, semi sensitive skin. I could tell with first use. I don't often comment on price because our budgets all vary, but I am commenting on this for being a good size, with great ingredients, effective results, and at a reasonable price ($20 is a good price point for this). Even with multiple "layers", it will last quite some time.My skin really did fall in love with it the first time I used it. I had just finished using a skin care line I ultimately wasn't crazy with. I had been skipping my usual dose of hydrating toner, and I felt that my skin was sorely missing the gentle hydration from skipping that as well as exacerbated dryness from a not too moisturizing skin care line. So now I am trying to return to my usual preferred products when this became available. Like I said, I haven't met any toners I didn't like. However, this one I have quickly- like first use- come to love. My skin is like, "ahhhhhh hydration". It feels so good that it doesn't seem like it would need a moisturizer on top-- but please do so you help lock in the hydration.I like it so much, that it absolutely will be repurchased when the time comes. I have a lot of skin care, and every once in awhile I think about what I would want to keep if I could only keep a few items. This is one of them, and I have loved other hydrating toners. I think I am sold on not only the way my skin feels but the medical grade ingredients. Functional skin care.My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, otherwise clear save for some redness & visible veins from Rosacea.------------------------------------------------------How to Use:  Use after washing the face.

634. -The best part of this mop and bucket system is the mop handle. It is stainless steel! It is super sturdy, and-It it long enough (49") for me (5'10") to hold comfortably. If you need it shorter, remove one section (and it will be 38").-I can really push into the floor without worry of this pole breaking.-Each section screws on. It comes with two cleaning pads.-The bucket it- as pictures- tall and thin. Does not take up much space in terms of storage. I haven't knocked it over yet, but I am aware that it could due to its tall center. It is a nice change from peeling the pads off and rinsing them by hand.-Micro fiber pads are pretty standard. They work the same as any of my others. Just presses on or peels off. Easily interchangeable.-You can access the interior of the bucket (for in depth cleaning and drying of the bucket, if need be) by popping out the handle. Then the rest can pop out. The bucket is surprisingly sturdy as well. It isn't a cheap feeling system at all.-The swivel mop portion is magnetic, so it will store as one long pole. Also makes it easier to use the bucket as you wont have a mop head impeding quick insertionOverall I am impressed. I am most excited for the metal pole. I am not used to using a bucket, don't feel I need one..  but this is neat to have. Again, I have not knocked it over. It seems to be well balanced. It works as described! I have 2 big labs and lots of sandy soil that gets tracked in with them, so floor sweeping, vacuuming, and washing is a regular chore.
635. I do not care for the packaging.At first, I thought the cut outs were neat. I like how there is a spot to store the cup, and the access area to the spout is tidy looking.Then it came time to pour product into the cup, and WHOA it comes pouring out. I really need to be on top of turning it off real quick lest I overflow my cup..again. So, in the future I will return to their regular bottles. If I had an empty I would pour this into that.The Dreft laundry detergent itself? LOVE IT. Smells SO GOOD... to me. MmmmmI have been using Dreft products on and off since 2007. I do not have kids, but at some point I ended up with the stain remover spray, which is awesome stuff. Then I would buy the detergent once in awhile, especially for use with my cats and dogs bedding. I hadn't purchased any in a long time,  I think a lot of other gentle products came to market and I simply got away from it (not the stain remover though, still the best for me). Forward to this box of detergent. I really don't recall now what the detergent of the past smells like but I really like the way this smells. It is similar to a few others out there- floral, sweet. You may or may not like it. I like it. It works well with anything I have washed so far. If the scent has changed any, I understand why some would not like it-- sometimes we want what is familiar to use and what has worked.Really not sure why anyone would think this was fake? It is sold by Dreft, not a 3rd party. Go to their page and it is ALL Dreft items. Anyway.. the detergent works as expected. Smells good too! Box.. eh, I could do without that. Use it as a refill if you really want the box style and not have more bottles building up.
636. These are big softgels, but they are easy to swallow. So smooth. The 60 softgel bottle is a 30 day supply. Just two a day provides 2500 mg of fish oil,  EPA 900 mg, DHA 600 mg, Other Omega-3 Fatty Acids 300 mg. This is a good amount!I have no problem taking this-- swallowing big smooth softgels dont bother me, I get no stomach upset, and not even any fishy tastes. Hint of lemon. I keep it at my desk and have it shortly after my first meal of the day.  I take fish oil for my health, as we all should! More specifically to keep my cholesterol on check. All the other is bonus. I got remiss on taking fish caps. I normally buy liquid as it is usually easier to find the higher amount, and many of the soft gels types that I have tried have been woefully low (like, maybe 10% of this). I was working through some low dosetiny softgels. I really need to get back to taking larger amounts, daily. The Vimerson Health Fish Oil Omega 3 has allowed me to do that. Sometimes I add in my other softgels later in the day, or take a swig of my liquid fish oil (my doctor said I can up to 5000mg daily- so I can double what I take of this, or just use up my other stuff).Some fish caps and liquids can have a fishy aftertasteburp. I am not sure what causes that-- whether it is the formula, or when it is taken. I haven't had that issue with these, but I do take them after I eat in the morning.I included pics of the softgels, the measurement, and even of one in my mouth. I suppose one could pop the soft gels and empty it out onto a spoon, or food. But really, these go down super easy... unlike tablets, capsules and softgels tend to be like that.
637. Humidifiers save my hair, my skin, my sinus' during our long, cold, dry Northern winters. I tend to use a cool mist humidifier in my bedroom (since I sleep with a husband and two large dogs and it gets really warm in there), and I prefer a warm mist humidifier everywhere else- warm just feels so nice. I sometimes boil water on my stove to help raise the humidity, but since I am not sitting next to the stove, I tend to carry a humidifier around with me from room to room. I have an old Vicks one that still functions, but I like the style of this one as it is easier to clean and set up wherever I am at. Takes up a bit less space.I think I measured it at being 9-10" wide at widest point, and about same in height. I currently use it most often next to me on the couch when I settling down for the evening (eat dinner, watch tv, veg out on couch with dogs). If I am going to be in my home office for long periods of time, i have moved it into there as well. If this continues to be a good one for me, I may just purchase another so I don't have to remember to move it around. I bet my dogs and my cats like it too since we have not been shocking each other as much when we touch.Water capacity is just a half gallon. I can keep it going for several hours on low, and I didn't keep track of how long on high. But low setting is supposed to be 13 hours. I would say that seems accurate. Overall,. I don't mind refilling it as I am not trying to use it for days on end. I actually prefer the slightly smaller capacity because it kinda grosses me out to use water that has been sitting for a long time. SO this is kinda perfect for me. But that is really just a preference thing.You will get greatest increase in humidity by using this in a small space, or if using in a larger space, then sitting next to it so you reap the benefits.One more thing.. It has an option for additives- a medicine cupvapor pad tray. I haven't had to use that yet, fortunately :)I haven't any complaints or concerns at this time. If I experience anything notable, I will be back to update.
638. I love beets- I'll take them any which way they are available, including powdered. This powder tastes like fresh beets in powdered form. I buy beet powder a couple times a year, and my experience with this so far is that it seems to be of great quality. Easy to add to anything. While I normally do smoothies, I am inclined to start adding it to batters and soups. What a great addition to muffins, pancakes, and breads. If you are into sipping broths and you happen to like the taste of beets, it is nice stirred into a mug of hot homemade broth. MMMIt does impart a beet taste, and it does turn everything pinkred.
639. I haven't been using this long, so far just once a day. I'm a little confused on dosing. There isn't any information regarding it on packaging other than add 1 scoop to your juice, smoothy or whatever. It says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract powder. Is that just weight, or is that the actual amount. Because.. that is 3000 mg of this extract otherwise-- which is higher than some other similar products out there. Maybe the serving size just happens to be larger where as the others are smaller with expectation to use it 2-3 times a day. This lack of clear info is frustrating. Hopefully other reviewers can comment on that.As for how it works. Well, I am not exactly sure what I am looking for it to do and how to measure my experience. I know it has been an ingredient used in weight loss formulations, and I sure could stand to lose several pounds, but I'm not sure about that for reviewing easily. Reading through some potential benefits like better digestion, better concentration, reduced food cravings, loss of appetite, reduced joint pain, improved cholesterol levels,  better mood, etc.. I figure the one I can measure best is the food cravings. I know what my habits are, and I will know if my desire for sugary foods reduces. So if I notice a reduction, then I can attribute it to this. So far, not feeling that, BUT it is early on and I have taken but one serving a day. I will give it a little more time and report back. Your desires for taking this as a supplement may vary from my own. There is no shortage of info on what this fruit is or its purported benefits are, as well as risks (such as do not take if have dementia or Alzheimer's) - so please read up. I know I am still learning.ACTUAL PRODUCT: So I will tell you more about the product itself. It is an 8 ounce bag of  garcinia cambogia extract powder. It is a resealable Mylar bag with a front window so you can see how much is in there. It comes with a small scoop, which is one serving. In my pic it shows the little scoop and the amount dumped into my hand. There are 76 servings in a container. If you plan to use it in liquid, plan to use a shaker cup or your blender. Just stirring it in will not work. I included a pic and you can see all the powder just sitting on top. Strangely, my spoon stayed dry. So that is when I got out the shaker cup and all blended fine with that.The taste is absent to me. Not sure if it supposed to have a noticeable flavor or not. The fruit is tart and I hadn't noticed a tart flavor with this. Maybe my taste buds are off. Seems that it will go well with yogurt, oatmeal, blended into smoothies, added to soups, broths, baked goods. I have been just consuming it with plain water or some organic lemonade in a shaker cup- because like I said, it doesn't mix by just stirring. The powder is fine, and not at all gritty. I'll likely add it into my next smoothy. I haven't tried it blended in with coffee- next time I will do that. I imagine if you like to fill your own capsules that this powder could work for that, but I don't know for sure.Everything about it seems fresh and of quality. I received it in 92019 and it has an expiration date of 32020; 6 months from now.  If I figure out anything else, I will be back to update. 3 stars because I need more time with product. Also I have no idea what the price is, and lack of info is concerning.
640. I like the mixture of ingredients incorporated into this product. The dose for one capsule seems rather low, so I have been taking two. I tend to have a sensitive stomach when it comes to taking pills. This formulation does not bother my stomach at all. Seems to be very gentle, which helps in compliance in taking these every day. I normally take a shot of ACV in a glass of water, and this is actually so much better. The other ingredients are great additions to help boost the affect of ACV. I seem to be in more control of my appetite lately, and I think that regular use of these pills have contributed to that. EVen so, taking ACV every day is beneficial to health.
641. Great quality, fair price. I purchased this brand and style over others brands and even amongst the other offerings within Carlson based on price and nutrient content per serving. This one rated best for me.  I began taking about a tablespoon each evening at dinner to help with high cholesterol numbers. Within a few months the next reading was perfect. My health team was impressed and high-fived me. I'll have another reading done in May.Good taste, no fishy burps, and I feel good taking it. I will buy from this company again.
642. Made well, great value, and shipping was speedy!
643. These earring hooks are super comfy! They look fantastic and sophisticated, unlike some of the other products. It comes with all the essential wire colors! Highly recommend!
644. It really works!
645. These are so convenient and work great!
646. I left the black pair in a jacket pocket and then washed and dried the jacket. The glasses and the case survived undamaged. ‘Nuff said!
647. Love the color and beads at the end. I use them to store my jewelry and the bags are durable.
648. These stuck on extremely well and were very comfortable!
649. Cute small boxes. The color pops. They came very well packaged so none came in bent.
650. These are delicious and so flavorful!!  I was expecting a vinegary, hot sauce taste, these are not like that at all, they are great for dipping or adding flavor to anything
651.  Hotep family. One thing you may have to do when putting this in your shoe is the cut it down a size or two. I had to cut it down three times before I could get it to be just fine. So, take your time cut it slow as you go. Try it in your shoe to see if it fits, if not you have to cut some more. I recommend my friend get a nice pair of shoes to put these in. Thank you for looking at my review. I hope it is helpful for you. If it was, please let me know by simply checking the helpful box below. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  Baba Oran Z
652. I use it on the very first rung. I don't use the two extra pads and it's just fine for me. This is similar to a lot of things that you see on the market and there are a lot of ways to Help your neck , back and your spine. I find this is lightweight easy to use. And less expensive than a lot of the so called pharmaceutical type neck rest. I think this is very good to use in a meditative state for 10 minutes or so. I recommend my friend. Keep pain free till the end. Thank you. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ
653. This is much better than just a tub you soak your feet in. This one gives you a foot massage and a foot cleaning at the same time. Feels good like it should. And there is not a lot of water to clean up. Thank you for reading my review. God bless. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ
654. I have not been taking this for long, so I do not know what the long term or the short-term effects are. I guess it is OK. I feel a little smarter. I will let you know how it goes. Thank you for reading my review I hope it was beneficial to you. God bless you and yours. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ
655. Men's Potty Portable Pee Bottle, Portable Urinals for Men, Reusable Male Pee Bottle Camping Toilet Thicken Men's Potty . Nice to have in an emergency. I am putting this in my emergency kit to save for an emergency.  OZ
656. Easily adjustable, not too tight and changes sizes easily.
657.  This doesn’t foam up and works well for cleaning carpets.  I like that there are no harsh chemicals, but more so…I’m glad it cleans.  It did a great job on my carpets and I will begin trying it on more things as well!
658. Nice dose amount of over 400mg of Saw Palmetto with 2.5 Elderberry.  This is a slight blend that the bottle label recommends one a day.  That's easy for me.  The other thing that is nice and easy is the clear bottle.  Now, I can see how much I have left.  Wish every bottle was clear!!!No fillers too and easy to swallow with liquid.Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
659.  This is like protein isolates on steroids. Extra healthy. Extra Protein for muscle fuel.. Plus, joint support and soft tissueAll in a great taste mix.Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
660.  These vitamins help provide some essential vitamins.  They have a good flavor, but they are Not soft.  The packaging is nice.  The gummies don’t come in a nice variety of color.  They look bland.  The vitamins are minimal, but cover the basics.Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
661. Zinc+C+Enchinacea herb = a great boost of immunity!A healthy system is dependent on many things including key ingredients for the body.  Here is what I like about this product...Zinc- helps with cellular metabolism and is required to activate enzymes to support immune functions.C’s — know as L-ascorbic acid, required for the biosynthesis of collagen. Is an antioxidant, and mobilizes other antioxidants in the bodyEnchinacea—also called purple coneflower a very popular herb in the world for treating cold, flu, pain, and inflammationThe hard facts: the human body does Not produce Zinc or C’s.  We do digest this in foods we eat.  However, I’m not always the most healthiest eater.  So, supplements can play a major factor in my body.  In one tablet (hard pill form) I get 889% of C’s, 455% Zinc, and for added protection Enchinacea 600mg.  All of these are in good high dose range.  I’m also sure my body can’t readily absorb all of these amounts,  however taking them I feel as if I will never lack these 3.No side affect from this for me, and I feel it will ward off some common illnesses.Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
662. Used these pom poms for my wives baby shower decor.. They are beautiful.. I will recommend this product
663. The hubby has high blood pressure and is overweight so in addition to the drugs the dr. has him on to control his blood pressure we've got him taking these apple cider vinegar pills (with dr's permission)  in the hopes that it will help his health situation.  While these are in no way as good as regular gummy bears they are better tasting than drinking apple cider vinegar or taking the pills which he's always had issues with anything in pill form.
664. It's so quiet you almost forget it on. I have 3 cats and a dog... so I'm sure the house can smell like pets, I walk into the room and it's just so fresh.
665. no more baggy in your pocket, love that they stack easily for space saving, open easy and nice pictures on them.
666. yep it's not the broom itself or even sweeping I hate, it's the dust pan!  I absolutely hate trying to wield a broom while bending over to attempt to get the debris into the dust pan - and it never fails I have to continuously move the dust pan to get whatever ended up going underneath it.  This dustpan is awesome!  Its on a long pole (well actually, 2 short poles screwed together), has a large capacity so it holds more debris and actually makes it to the garbage without a lot of it ending up on the floor before you get there.  Very happy with this product.
667. What’s not to like about lavender? Lasts long and smells amazing
668. This Heated Hair Straightener Brush is okay. I didn’t like the very small section that the hair should go into to straighten. I have a place in the back that has a little curl, but the rest of my hair is straight. This straightener did not straighten that part of my hair.The box comes with a straightener brush with a power cord. The handle has a power button and two buttons for raising and lowering the temperature. Instructions are included.I will not be recommending this Heated Hair Straightener Brush to family and friends.
669. This Facial Cleansing Brush works great. I love the way the brush feels on my skin. My face feels so clean after using this brush.The box comes with a facial cleanser with three brushes. One brush is made of nylon wool and can be used daily. Another brush is short nylon and can be used daily. The last brush is for sensitive skin. It is made with silica gel and can be used daily. There is also a USB cord for charging and also a user’s manual.I will be recommending this Facial Cleansing Brush to family and friends.
670. This AVCOO 4 Channel TENS Unit for Pain Relief is not for me. I got this for upper back pain. The caution part says where my pain is could cause rhythm disturbances which could be lethal.The box comes with a muscle stimulator machine. It has 12 electrode pads. It also comes with cables, a drawstring bag, and instructions.I will not be recommending this AVCOO 4 Channel TENS Unit for Pain Relief to family and friends.
671. This Safe 'n Easy All Green Cleaner Countertops may have been good but I got an almost empty bottle. The bottle leaked and it is just a mess inside the plastic bag. I was able to read that it could cause severe burns if it gets on the skin, so I will not be opening the plastic bag.The bottle has instructions and if it hadn't leaked I would be able to read it. The bottle does have a sprayer included in the package. I am disappointed that I was unable to use this cleaner.I will not be recommending this Safe 'n Easy All Green Cleaner Countertops to family and friends.
672. This Sandalwood Essential Oil smells great. I put a little bit of this in my diffuser and my house smells great. It didn't take much for this to spread through my whole house.The pack comes with 3.38 fluid ounces of sandalwood essential oil. It also comes with a dropper.  There are ways to use the essential oil on the side of the bottle.I will be recommending this Sandalwood Essential Oil to family and friends.
673. This Cordless Auto Curler is horrible. It did not have instructions for how to put my hair into the curler so I watched a video of a similar curler. I put a small piece of my freshly washed, combed hair over the section to curl my hair. I pushed the button to curl my hair, the section that rotates in the middle grabbed my hair but not all of it at once. My hair got caught in the curler and I had to pull it to get my hair out. It damaged my hair.The box comes with a curler, a base, and a power cord. It has vague instructions when it comes to actually put your hair into the curler. It does have instructions on the different settings.I WILL NOT be recommending this Cordless Auto Curler to family, friends, or even enemies
674. This SUPERSRED 54w USB Red Light Therapy doesn't do anything as far as I can tell. Half the lights do not work. I don't know if that is how it is supposed to be but I doubt it. It does come on, the timer works and the stand is nice. There is instructions for the timer but nothing else.The light comes with a nice stand, it took a little bit to get it to work but it is nice. It also comes with a power cord that has a timer on it. There are 18 places for lights but only half of mine work so I don't know if that is a defect or if that is what it is supposed to do.I will not be recommending this SUPERSRED 54w USB Red Light Therapy to family and friends.
675. These KAIRNE Reusable Cotton Rounds are great for removing makeup. I have used them twice and they are easy to use. I have not used the enclosed bag to wash them yet.The rounds come in an adorable container for storing your pads. The container comes with two tops one is sort of like a stopper and the other covers it. The pads could be used with a cleanser to wash your face also. I just toss the used pads in the enclosed laundry bag for washing later.I will be recommending these KAIRNE Reusable Cotton Rounds to family and friends.
676. I saw a commercial for this Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower. I loved the way it lathered up on the commercial. It did not do this for me. I tried both sides. I tried more body wash. I tried rubbing the back scrubber against itself to create the lather. Nothing worked.I loved the feel of the little scrubbers and it may very well be a good exfoliator but that is about all it would be good for. The description for this scrubber said, "Improves vascular blood circulation, helps evenly distribute fat deposits, and release metabolic waste of your skin at the same time". I can't see that this will be effective.I will not be recommending this Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower to friends and family. I will be letting them know that the commercial shows a lot of lather but it did not produce that for me.
677. The denture bath is nice but it's too small.
678. This is a set of 10 protein powder packets. The packets can be mixed with water or in a smoothie. The packets are very convenient. You can put them in your gym bag for after your workout, or you could take them to the office for a healthy snack at the end of the day. The packets contain 200 calories and 10 grams of protein. They feature an appealing texture and excellent flavor. These travel packets are an excellent way to ensure you always have a healthy option to help fend off cravings.
679. SO a couple of things I noticed- I did this on a day where the back half of the house was in full sun and the front was in shade. The windows in the back were super hot and the crystals from this started showing instantly and seemed to come out better. So people with poor results on this might try heating up the window with a blow dryer first or something if it's cold out. The front windows still did decent, just took them some time to dry and the crystals to show up.I can say from experience- don't overdo it all at once on a window! If you do then you'll get runs in your crystals and it detracts from them a bit. So lightly spray the window and let it dry for a bit and once it's dry to touch, decide if you need to follow up with another coat.Pro tip, if you want it to look professional then use a piece of cardboard along the edges as you spray or tape all of your window trim with masking tape before spraying this. Especially around darker window frames. If you have white window frames then it probably wouldn't be an issue. I have dark brown aluminum frame windows and the over spray of this looks kinda junky. It does wipe off though so I just have to find time and go out and wipe the edges down for a cleaner look.Overall I'm truly amazed by the frozen window look these created! I did it for privacy and you can't see past it- it looks great! It's very classy looking.
680. Very interesting concept to have refill pods you can put into this container. Neat idea and hopefully cuts down on waste!The lotion itself works great! No overpowering scent- which is nice. You don't want heavily scented things on your face- it'll often break it out. The lotion is very moisturizing too! My face feels so soft with this on!Overall this is a great product and an innovative design!
681. I love this because it has no scent at all and it works very well to clean with! Works great for countertops, floor spills, bathtub, sink- I've used it on many surfaces and it works great on all of them!
682. These smell great and are great quality! Worked very well, very pleased with this box set!
683. I absolutely love all of the different scents in this big set!! All really good quality scents and work great in my diffusers! My house smells just amazing with these!
684. Bottles are mislabeled- they say unscented but it is scented as the listing says. Scent is pretty good. Product works decently at stain removal.
685. These all smell great and worked well! Very moisturizing and fun to use in the bath! We loved each and every one of them!!
686. Everything in here is great quality, was very impressed! The resealable herb bags are all pretty good sized pouches and look really nice. The little jars of gems all look amazing. One of the labels was poorly put onto the jar but we managed to pull the label off and fix it. The box the little gem jars is in barely fits them, it's quite a struggle getting them all back jammed in if you pull them out.Overall this is a really cool kit and everything is great quality looks great!
687. Love this! It smells amazing! Very good quality oil and it made my house smell great when I put it in my diffuser! You definitely have to try this one! The bottle was very well packaged and they put a nice foam protector over the dropper included. They also plastic wrapped the whole box this comes in. Great product all around!
688. LOVE these bags! They're absolutely beautiful! I'm obsessed with anything holo and had to grab them and I'm glad I did! They're well made resealable bags that are very thick. Could be great for storing candy, snacks, various herbs, little parts, the sky is the limit! You can use a heat thing and seal the top up easily too. These things are just amazing!!
689. Really good quality, arrived in perfect shape, loved each and every scent in this box! Highly recommend.
690. Perfect for just about anything. Been using these about 6 months now and they are durable. Used for colloidal silver in the eyes, ears and nose when necessary and never let us down!
691. This rich organic cream is great for high altitude, dry, and aging faces. It softens and moisturizes all night. My skin is sensitive and often breaks out if I use products that are too heavy. The consistency of this one worried me a little. It didn't soak in all the way. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't one of those that's so greasy you have to wash your pillowcase. It's creamy. It's just a little thicker than I usually use. It turned out fine, though. It worked great.Amazon's packaging didn't work quite as well as usual. It came through the mail in a padded envelope and the product box was smashed. If you wanted to give it as a gift, that might have been a problem. The jar containing the product (inside the box) came through fine though. It was in perfect condition. I didn't care about the box anyway, so that didn't matter.
692. Works great.  Very easy to use
693. Nope! Huge nope on this stuff. It smells horrible and the taste is just as bad as the smell. I made the mistake of trying another flavor and it had the same horrible rancid vitamin smell as this one and I can tell you right now, I didn't feel like getting sick from this stuff either. Just stay away from this stuff unless you like the rancid vitamin taste.
694. Let me just start from the beginning. First, the packaging for this is super cute and totally is what drew me to this energy supplement. The packaging draws you in and the name itself totally makes you want to see what this is. Then you read Cherry Bomb and I was totally intrigued and it sounds like it would be an awesome flavor. This stuff ticked all my boxes on looks and drawing me in.However, when I opened it and smelled what was in this, nope, nope, oh heck to the nope nope. I have to be completely honest, I can't even tell you what it smelled like because it's not something I've ever smelled. Yeah, tells you exactly what it is huh. I know, it's driving me crazy too because it's this strong striking scent that you think you know but then when you think about it, you really have no idea. Then I tried it. Worst mistake ever. It's like battery acid meets stomach bile, except I'd rather drink that. The worst part is while I was very hesitant to even try this after smelling it, I was like I've tried things that smelled horrible, tried it, and honestly it was awesome. However, me being dumb and super thirsty I ended up downing half a bottle before wanting to rip my tongue out. It's messed up because it started out totally fine until you stop drinking and then the smell turns into the taste. My tongue is still mad at me, and I don't blame it. I still have remnants of the smell and then it reminds me of the taste and I spit up a bit. Yeah, it's gross. It's more than gross, seriously don't buy this stuff. And being someone that drinks zero sugar drinks and sugar-free stuff, it's not this being sugar-free.On another note, I wish everything came with the little scoops that Glytch uses. It's a scoop and funnel in one and is totally genius. So at least I got a super awesome scoop out of this horrid stuff.
695. Now, these are awesome sponges. I had to replace a sponge I had for a while and these have been awesome. I love the two different sides because you have the normal washing sponge part but then the top side is a rough exfoliating side and it works great for those rough areas and getting off all the dead skin that's built up from the winter. I am loving these and they are making my skin feel amazing.
696. These drawstring bags are awesome and such a great touch for my earrings and other jewelry I make and sell. These are very well made and just look great. So happy with these and the look of them.
697. These bags are beautiful and perfect for thank you gifts or for my small shop. Such a beautiful touch for anyone that buys from me. These are very well made, thick paper, and can hold a good amount of weight. Very happy with these.
698. These bags are perfect for anything you need them for. I use them in my shop and add my own stickers and they look awesome and I am able to put so much inside of them. They are awesome and I am very happy with them.
699. These tissues are great and I love the packaging. They are soft and easy on the nose. Great for the home and in the car.
700. These are not the best reading glasses that I have had before and I have bought plenty of the cheap dollar store glasses. These do seem to be well made but they are pretty small for me and don't fit the face very well. I tried to bend them and give them a bit of shape but it doesn't seem to help them fit better or even feel comfortable. However, they do the job for reading at the computer and other things. Plus you get three pairs for the price, just in case you loose one pair you have two others. Overall, they are okay and will work for anyone in a pinch or just needing some cheap glasses that they don't mind something happening to.
701. I really like the Saturix 11x16 Prep & Spill Pads, as they lay on a surface very flat. I have tried household basics like paper towels, cotton shop towels and brown paper rolls but they all have a flaw that makes then difficult to use. When I am working with products, like prepping a model for a very clean mold, I cannot introduce lint, as I would with cotton towels. I have to be aware of chemical compatibilities, and paper towels usually contain clay for extra absorbancy and make dust. Brown paper slides on the surface, and does not always help with all spills. I felt like I had to choose the lesser of evils. These pads are exactly what I have been looking for, but simply did not know what they were called. I like the  polyethylene backing, which can hold up against mild solvents like isopropyl alcohol. I appreciate the company also features domestic contact information on the package.

702. My skin is sentive skin . After use this facial brush I feel It's very harsh for my skin.
703. Skin feels very soft, the vibration is very relaxing!
704. I've been actively using this product for now and I’ll probably never stop. it's just THAT good eyebrow and facial hair trimmer. painless hair remover is simple to use: remove the cap, slide the switch on and gently press the head of the unit flat against your skin. Continue making small circular motions to remove any unwanted hair. Best part, it DOES NOT hurt and does a great job removing the hair quickly.
705. Wow I like the colors and quality is good !!
706. I like this water. It has a good flavor, and I like that it isn't overly sweet. I find it very refreshing over ice.
707. My recent blood work shows that this is working. It is keeping my D levels where they are supposed to be. I recommend these.
708. This is a great little device. I put it in our downstairs bathroom, where we have our cat litter box. It really helps to control the odor in there. It smells much cleaner, and fresher, since I put the device in. It is really easy to use. Just plug it in and turn it on. This device is really useful for a small space, like our bathroom. I don't think it would work in a large room. I do recommend it.
709. Very cool it comes with 4 thooth bushes so you can share and they are numbered so they wont get mixed up with your kids toothbush either. My theeth feel nice and shiny clean after I bush with this bush.
710. It was the business lol no but really it was very easy to use and comfortable.
711. This did a good job with my hair. It worked as it was supposed to. It seemed like it was good quality. My hair came out looking nice after I used it. It also seemed durable. It was easy to hold and handle. I was pleased and would recommend it.
712. These cleaning gloves worked fine. I like that they were so big because they covered a lot of my hands. I had been using disposable and they always broke, so it is nice to have something that stays nice. They seemed pretty durable and strong. I plan to use them again and again. I was pleased with quality. I would recommend them.
713. These balloons looked very nice. It really looked great. It seemed professional and not like a DIY. It wasn’t too hard to do. My kids love balloons so they thought this was nice. The special balloons are neat.This party kit was very nice. It is so nice to get all of these coordinating items. There is so much to it. It really looks good together. It is also a good value to get everything together instead of going to the party store and needing to buy everything individually. It is easier, more convenient and cheaper.We were pleased with the quality. It didn’t take too long to set up. Everything went up okay. My kids liked it. I thought it was very cute and very festive. I would recommend it.
714. Looking at the bristles of the JSK Replacement Toothbrush Heads, they look similar to the Philips Sonicare HX902365 but be aware that these replacement heads do not have the RF chips that the higher-priced Sonicare brushes require.  The bristles are described as soft and because I actually prefer medium brushes, these were a little bit soft for me.The packaging is nice and simple.  It's a simple cardboard box that contains the brush heads in their own individual plastic wrappers that are easy to open.  No blister packs to deal with.If you own a basic Sonicare brush, this is a solid replacement that you wouldn't try to use for longer than recommended because of how much the originals cost.
715. Perfect as an addition to a raffle basket with a Sleep theme
716. Bought as a gift for my husband. He loves them
717.  Eerily lifelike!This is by far one of the best if not the best male masturbation toys I've ever used. Three different experiences in one!Pros:-Soft material-Variety of experiences-Finger groves for more grip-Easy to clean-Pleasure grooves and nubsCons:None at this time.Seriously this is an awesome toy! The material is so soft and lifelike.I was selected to review this item at a discount. My reviews are based on personal use, quality and performance and are never manipulated or altered in any way.
718. If you’re not comfortable using gloves when handling clay and other artist’s materials, these are great! Made of silicone, this set comes in 3 sizes. The small fits my pinky, the medium fits my index finger and the large is for my thumb. They have little dot nubs on them but you can turn them inside out for a completely smooth surface. Reusable, washable so it’s eco friendly. Comes in 4 sets of small, medium and large (12 total).
719. I enjoy using them when I can. They leave white marks...but once it gets the job done I’m happy to wash the marks away 😁
720. My blepharitis was making me crazy. These are easy to use and work like they say.
721. Very nice gloves that protect from hot dishwater and soap. I normally wear a small and these are mediums, but still fit well.
722. I do a lot of cooking and have a commercial grade stove. This cleaned up my greasy spatter in a heartbeat. You can use it full strength for really bad messes or diluted half and half with water for everyday cleaning.  The even include a spray bottle and a squeeze top for the big bottles so that it is easier to pour.
723. Perfect for my project!
724. I absolutely love,love,love this brand of oils! I have ordered four and I am never dissapointed! I put them in the diffuser and my house smells amazing! I like them so much, I ordered my mom some! I love the orange smell! It is energizing and wakes me up in the morning! I love to mix orange and peppermint from this brand,it is absolutely delightful! I highly recommend and I would definetly buy again! I also love that it is certified organic! It is also very reasonably priced!
725. I absolutely love,love,love this high quality oil! I put it in my diffuser and the house smelled great! I love the fact it is certified organic,so I know my kids are not inhaling nasty chemicals or GMO's! I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest review. After I review this I am going to see what other scents they have available! I have tried a lot of oils and this is the best I have ever tried! I would give it 10 stars if I could! I highly recommend and I would definetly buy again!
726. There is no way to thread the electric of a mask. Even following the directions on the site.
727. Is what I was looking for.
728. Recieved on time, exactly what I needed
729. I often like to accentuate colognes with essential oils and this is a perfect essential oil blend for the summer.I’ve found this blends perfectly with Spice Bomb as it has citrus notes already.The applicator makes putting the appropriate amount of this oil on easy.  I just add a bit to my wrists and neck prior to spraying my cologne.I’ve really enjoyed this essential oil blend and definitely recommend it.Thanks for reading my review.  I enjoy writing them as I value reading other’s reviews when I’m making a buying decision.

I will always make every effort to answer any questions I can as it is my pleasure to help.
730. Nearly every time I’ve ever purchased rubber  gloves they have either been far too big or too small - the ones in this set absolutely could not fit any better!From the fit in the fingers to across the palm and back of the hand to up the arm - these gloves are exactly the right size for me.There are 4 pairs of gloves in this set!  Two sets of gloves that are unlined that feel just like a second skin - providing the ultimate in dexterity while still protecting your hands.  And the other two pairs of gloves are flocked with a cotton liner making them not only easier to get on and take off but softer and providing some protection from hot dish water.On both types of gloves, the tips of the fingers are reinforced giving extra durability yet still allowing for excellent dexterity and range of motion.  The texture on the palm and finger pads aides in being able to grip and hold anything you are working on without any issue.The forearm protection 6.5”  giving the ability to reach down into liquids without the liquid flooding the glove - the total length of the glove is 12.6”.These gloves are constructed from PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) and are thus Latex free making them excellent for those with a Latex allergy.I have really put these gloves to the test with the unlined gloves I have worked outside, scrubbing metal cabinets with wire brushes and chemicals and have yet to wear through a single pair!  I have used the lined gloves as I’ve cleaned my grill and scoured countless dirty pans.These are the best rubber gloves I have ever seen.  I definitely recommend these to those looking for excellent, long lasting rubber gloves to protect your hands!  This is an outstanding buy!

732. This supplement is utilizes a blend of ingredients that increase energy and increase alertness.What’s in it:Thiamin: Vitamin B1, thiamin, or thiamine, enables the body to use carbohydrates as energy. It is essential for glucose metabolism, and it plays a key role in nerve, muscle, and heart function.Riboflavin: Vitamin B2 is a water-soluble vitamin that is flushed out of the body daily. It helps the body break down carbohydrates, proteins and fats to produce energy, and it allows oxygen to be used by the body.Niacinamide: a form of vitamin B3, an essential nutrient that supports many cellular processesIt uses an enormous dose of B12 and B6.B6: one of the B vitamins that benefits the central nervous system. It is involved in producing the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, and in forming myelin.B12: may benefit your body in impressive ways, such as by boosting your energy, improving your memory and helping prevent heart disease.The proprietary blend contains about the amount of caffeine as the average cup of coffee.Guarana Seed Extract is used for weight loss, to enhance athletic performance, as a stimulant, and to reduce mental and physical fatigue. It is a frequent addition to energy and weight loss products.L-Tyrosine may improve mood and cognitive and physical performance.Eleuthero Root Extract: Eleuthero is also commonly called Siberian ginseng.  Often used to boost energy, metabolism, and physical performance.I found this supplement to be very effective. In my experience I would not recommend taking it within 10 hours of bedtime.  Based on the enormous dose of several of the B vitamins I wouldn’t recommend taking this supplement regularly but as an occasional supplement it definitely works.⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

733. After this review the company revised their instructions so they are larger, and easy to follow.  This is a great improvement in being able to use this product correctly.  I did wear this but still found that after one hour or so, the straps loosened so I had to keep adjusting them.  Also the strap that goes under one’s armpit started to hurt.  I asked several friends of varying heights and weights, to try this product and they had similar feedback re: discomfort under the armpit when wearing it for more than 15 minutes.  I really like the idea, but perhaps consider narrowing the part that goes under the arm pit and widening the part that goes on top of the shoulder... Not easy to do as there are so many varying sizes of people.  The posture corrector is useful when sitting and working on the computer, or doing something at one’s desk.
734. This gave me a swollen eye and ridiculous lashes that curled on themselves all the way back to my eyelid.The sticky rods TORE MY SKIN OPEN. There was a little piece of my skin stuck to the rod, and a hole on my eyelid. Wtf. Removing the super sticky rods caused my lids to bruise all along the lashline.Then my eye swelled up either because of the trauma, or because of product getting into the wound. Either way, bad news.Eyes are delicate, don't mess with this.No ingredients listed, no brand to complain to. This is imported from China with no consumer safety guarantees.
735. This product is fine so long as it's used properly. Obviously this is my fault for not being extra careful. Mixed up my regular solution with this bottle and lord well you can see what happened. Yes it says on the label not to put in eye like that but the packages I think needs to change as it looks to much like normal solution. After research I've seen this has happened to others as well. I just wanted to warn people about being extra extra careful.
736. got it yesterday and worked less then 30 sec. started shorting in first try. returning today.
737. I purchased these for the Charcoal bristle brushes, I received the package, there are white bristle brushes and Charcoal bristle brushes in the package, they all have different letters but they don't tell you if the letters stand for the different softness levels of the brushes or what they represent. The brushes loose their bristles after about the first 10 brushes so they're definitely disposable. I am keeping them for guests to use but not what I was hoping for.
738. Easy to take and a very non-offensive taste. The product is in a glass amber bottle and has a rubber squeezy. I take daily for hair growth and internal ligament protection.
739. Awesome quality! I add to smoothies and it blends without clumping. Smells and looks fresh. After unpacking, I noticed the inner seal had come undone just a little causing some product to poof out. I didn’t detect any off-scent though.
740. These pouches are awesome to travel with. A pouch lasts a week! Not the end all be all lotion but pretty hydrating. Smells nice and absorbs into skin quickly. The top cap secures on tight so you can toss this in your bag without fear of leaking. Cool concept. I’m happy to have these.
741. I’ve used this for a month now. The wood has stayed fine in my shower with no peeling or warping. No bristles have fallen out. My problem is that the bristles are SUPER HARD AND SCRATCHY! Like, serious ouchie. And they haven’t softened with a month of daily use. Also, the plastic side is worthless. And that’s the only part that has discolored. I can’t really recommend, so order with caution!
742. I’ve taken milk thistle for several years to protect my liver against the daily damage I do to it with alcohol, ibuprofen and whatever else hurts it!! This product is as good as it gets. Very high concentration, super clean smelling. 120 capsules per bottle = excellent value. I take nightly. My last blood screens came back in normal range, doc said all looks great. I believe in the power of this!
743. First time I’ve ever taken a tablet vs capsule and I really like it! Easy to swallow and provides 700 mg turmerictablet. The tablets are much smaller than a penny and fit inside my pill box neatly. They do smell like what they are! Which I like and makes me think they are fresh and active. That said, even though they smell spicy, my tummy has never had an issue with them. 240 in each bottle makes this an excellent value! I love turmeric and the pain free life it allows me to live!
744. These are super heavy and thick. The grosgrain ribbon is a really ugly brown color in relation to the gold letters and the stark white bag. Also, you need to insert ribbon handles into holes yourself. The tips of handles are reinforced with plastic so it apppears they won’t slip out. I wish the manufacturer would have just assembled everything. The bottom of the bag also is reinforced. All the folds are super clean.
745. Very heavy and thick thank you bags. They have crisp, clean folds and a reinforced bottom. I’m confused as to WHY the handles aren’t put in for you. The handles are almost like a grosgrain ribbon. They have plastic at the tip. You’ll need to push the tip thru both holes then cross your fingers that they hold up after something heavy is in bag. Though it seems like plastic tip is enough for them not to slip thru.
746. I gave this NAC 5 stars because it’s easy to swallow, it doesn’t upset my stomach and it’s the 1st NAC I’ve taken that doesn’t smell like stinky rotten eggs upon opening the bottle every day. There still is a subtle smell but totally bearable.
747. The dosage is 6 pills twice a day. Not a very good value. Smells fine, tastes fine, just too big a dose to get benefits! I prefer a once daily tablet.
748. Initially the vanilla flavor is a little jarring and astringent. Maybe tastes a bit on the phony side. But I got used to it and now it's nice to have little sweetness in my coffee. The portion in each of these pouches is perfect. And each one has 7g of MCT's in it. 80 calories, 7 g fat, 4 g carbs and 4 g sugar alcohols which cancel the carbs out. Must be working because I haven't got put of ketosis after using (keto test strip wurine)  and have lost 8 lbs. That's rad!!
749. Great line up with this combo-travel pack. Everything can easily slip into bag so you can have freshy fresh breath on the go. This is an interesting taste. I taste clove and mint. All 4 kids use it without complaint too and we all agree it makes our mouths feel super clean.
750. I love Swanson products and this is a mainstay in our home for things like Poison Ivy prevention or treatment, certain pain, etc. ( do a search on Rhus Tox and what it is all for)
751. My husband is 71 and this really helps him with prostate issues. He always lets me know when to re-order.
752. I bought this for my husband and he raved about it! Uses it every day.
753. My kids have gotten really into bath bombs with toys inside, so we parents decided to try some non-toy versions for us too! These are great, the fizz is exactly what we expected, it creates a very pleasing smell and feel to the water, and your skin definitely feels softer and moisturized as a result as well. I really like these and highly recommend them!
754. I've been using disposable gloves to clean with lysol and other corrosive chemicals in our bathrooms and kitchens. It is a waste to keep throwing them away not to mention they often rip mid-job. These are great- nice and thick, and I love that they are reusable so I don't have to keep throwing away and buying more. I did notice that some grime from my oven seems to have discolored the white one a bit in a way that doesn't just wash off, but I suppose that's to be expected from a white latex glove. Eventually I'll throw that one away after a few more uses, and that's why it is great that there are multiple sets in this pack!
755. they're pretty but don't really affect the smoking experience. the only time you taste it is if you lick it directly
756. Very cute , serves its purpose. Can easily replace little container and continue using the floral box or repurpose the little box. Everything in n it matches and the mirror is adequate.
757. These bamboo toothbrushes are nice for the price. This multipack includes both adults and children’s sizes in different color bristles.There is nothing extraordinary about these, however the price is good and they are 💯 biodegradable which is better for the environment.They work just as a toothbrush should. The firmness of the bristles feel medium, not too soft.. yet not too hard.
758. I have been taking the Etana Immune Blend supplement and I like it. It contains the key ingredients to help protect my immune system. These capsules are standard size and easy to swallow. Also, there is no bad taste or aftertaste. We’ll see how it holds up as America reopens from the pandemic!
759. I have been taking this liquid vitamin daily and at first the taste is not great at all. You eventually get used to the taste after a few days. I have already noticed an increase in my energy level since taking this!
760. This heating pad is so nice! The pad size is big enough to cover my entire back! My wife and I both suffer from back and neck issues, so this product is a lifesaver! I love how soft the pad is, it feels like a soft blanket. I also love the extra long cord. You can also control the temperature and how long you want it to stay on with the controller attached to the cord which is awesome! It heats up in a minute or 2! Very nice quality heating pad!
761. This collagen protein powder is so nice! My wife mixed in with her coffee and barely noticed a taste from it! It dissolves perfectly too! No lumps! If you sniff the container upon opening you notice a slight smell to it, but it’s light and not overpowering. This stuff is great!
762. Yum!! This tastes so good in your coffee mixed with a hint of chocolate... Just like an Almond Joy candy bar!! I only docked 1 star because it’s a bit pricey for such a small bag. Tastes good though!
763. I have been taking this pill for a few days and they are easy to swallow. The instructions say to take with a meal, so I have been taking them with my lunch. The smell is a bit unpleasant at first, but you get used to it after a few days. Haven’t noticed any changes yet, but I am sure that will come within time. You can’t go wrong with the price compared to other probiotics!!
764. Didn’t seem to do anything-  the stretch was good - no pain relief - no cooling like other lidocaine products
765. VERY soothing.  I get that awful tickly dry cough a lot during allergy season, especially 5 minutes after lying down to sleep, and this actually quiets it down with zero side effects.  I just wish it came in a purse-size.
766. Bitter, bitter, bitter... I still drank it in different ways, hot, cold, in different rooms, lol.  I did not receive a relaxed feeling. I do not foresee me purchasing this product again.
767. I've been taking turmeric curcumin for a couple months now for inflammation from arthritis. I just don't know what to expect so I don't know how well it is working. What I do know is that this product has the right formula with the 95% curcuminoids and the price was better than others. I'm giving it six months to see if I feel an appreciable difference in my joint pain.I don't want to give them a bad rating when I 'm not sure if it's working yet.
768. I have sensitive skin and use this to spot treat dry areas. During colder months, I apply all over face and neck before bed and my skin looks amazing in the morning!
769. Everyone in the family likes this blend a lot. But it's not what I consider a ice cream shop smell. My husband and I agreed we would describe it as a muted watermelon jolly rancher mixed with a sweet strawberry cream. It's pretty strong too. 5 out of 5 stars on the throw. If you're into the fruit blends, this one is definitely trying recommend.
770. These were very easy to fill and look great hang among the other balloon decor. The black color really helped the numbers stick out, so I'm glad I went with this set. They've stayed filled for a couple days now when they're working out fantastically Our son was very happy and said they were his favorite part of all the decorations.
771. My 7yo loves this mask! Her room faces east; so even with double curtains, the sun still peaks in most mornings. Since she's had this mask, she's enjoying sleeping in! Not to mention, it's adorable. We'd both recommend it!!!
772. These glasses seem to be a wire-eh style.  They can get easily crushed in man pockets.  So i'm not sure.  The frame is too lightweight and lacks the comfort at the ear piece and nose piece.  I wanted wider fitting for my BIG head.  So, these were good for that purpose.  Yet, when they are on, and I am looking thru the glasses, I can see the glass frame edges all the time.  I since bought another STYLE glasses.  And now, use these as spares, around the house.* yes, they fit around my BIG head nicely.* no, the lenses are smaller than comfort* nose piece is flimsy* entire glass frame is flimsy
773. Packaged well. It's a Jingao brand, whatever that is. I like the design, not too big, not too small. It comes with an adjustable blade cover, which is thoughtful. I took it off because the area left open to actually shave wasn't very big. I love the fact that it's corded, and has an indicator light when it's plugged in. It did not get hot. The big complaint is that it's not as powerful as it should be. It took too many passes to clean up my mitts. The price is right, but the power isnt.
774. good product
775. My sheepskin boots don't have a removable insole and had gotten very unfluffy at the bottom. These fixed that and I will get at least another year out of the boots. Thanks!
776. Nice appearance and great packaging. There is no smell and virtually no taste, so there’s no need to mask the taste or put it into your food or drink. I like this product and will purchase it again.
777. Sprayer doesn’t work. Very little comes out and difficultgets stuck when you press down to spray.
778. Smells yummy and I love the towel. Thank you!!!
779. Perfect for a tween or teen! I can't see this lasting long for an adult, but it has been a good purchase for my 11 year old as we have started discussing the importance of keeping your skin clean.
780. this is made of plastic, and does not hold suction.  Bad product.
781. I use this when I need a Ben gay type lineament. It's kinda pricey, and smelly in a good way, and washes off of my hands easily with soap. Plus- no chemically ingredients.
782. Works perfectly for thick ingrown toenails. Love the little tools in the handles, very useful.
783. Excellent flavor and I know from previous use of a different flavor that these work quite well for my upsets.
784. Ordered this for my Mom who lives all day in a nursing home. So far this seems to be working great for her when so many cushions before haven't.
785. It is a strong astringent so is great for oral health, tightening gums. I dilute three drops in a teaspoon of water to swish and then dab a little on my deepest wrinkles. It is reducing them a lot. how funny. It looks like blood and would stain but outside the dumb name, it is great stuff.
786. Slim and well made.  It fits perfectly at the end of my 12&#34; deep cupboard over the sink.  The installation was easy because of the numerous slots available for drilling and anchoring. The Georgia Pacific 21000 two ply style towels fit just right and pull out singularly without waste.  This is the second commercial-style towel dispenser that I have purchased for my kitchen in the last four years.  The first one was a slim roll design that dispensed single ply towels.  The double  ply towels dispensed with this unit are stronger and more absorbent requiring fewer towels for average cleanup in the kitchen.  This was actually a cost-saving investment.
787. I did not like this. I had ACL surgery a few years ago. My knee gives me trouble still but this was like a rubber band around a joint — painful! I couldn’t walk well with it on and it just kind of felt uncomfortable. No likey! I would rather a compression sleeve.
788. I can't find a way to contact the seller to ask and returns are aggravating, but this 100% smells like citronella so I can't use it in my lotion bars and had to use my vanilla extract instead. I will keep it for future bug spray use lol. The coconut they sent smells exactly like coconut though.
789. I've taken this product for years and I've watched the price rise from $40 to almost $70.  Since I never wanted to run out I order a few in advance and they come wrapped in a plastic you cannot see through.  The instructions have always been, 2 scoops a day.  But NOW, without every saying a word, they DOUBLED the size of the scope but didn't increase the amount of product.  It's literally twice the size.  So now you are getting a crap load of filler and using twice the product, so twice the price, without you ever noticing.  I'll use up what I have because it's too late to return, but I will never buy from this company again.  What a total bate and switch.

791. A little disappointed. I have another air purifier by the manufacturer and it works great so I thought this would be perfect for the laundrylitter box room. It was great for size and didn’t scare the kittens. But it didn’t do much for the odor.
792. There were a ton of the things in the picture that were missing. One of the light strings was severed in two places so it wouldn’t be possible to turn it on. And honestly the quality wasn’t good at all.
793. Back support
794. Too many wild designs rather 10 of solid colors
795. These small glasses are perfect for those who can never find a pair for reading - I keep one pair in the car and another on the coffee table in the TV room.  They have clear lenses, and are lightweight, and don’t give my hearing aids any trouble going on and off.  Great for those “extra” pairs!
796. I have had this for while and wasn’t sure  about its best use but I found it.  This essential oil roll on works great on itchy bug bites or other skin irritation.  I had a rather large welt from a bug bite one day, itchy and irritated and decided to use this on it and the itch went away right away and the next day the welt and any trace of the bite was gone.  Smells so nice too!
797. We’ve been eating a lot of one dish meals lately - stews and soups - and it is so easy to just add this to the gravy or sauce as it’s cooking.  Haven’t been using it long enough to report spectacular results - but it makes sense to add collagen when you can, since we lack it as we age.  The bone broth just adds more flavor to our dishes, so we have every reason to continue with this healthy practice.  Good quality product - no negative effects.
798. The interior is made of bamboo foam - and covered with a cotton sleeve.  Very comfortable roller - firm for a good massage.  My granddaughter swears by it, and is able to handle it easily, for a gentle or very firm massage.  She prefers it to other rollers.

This kit includes everything you need to scrub feet and nails, and a rasp for smoothing down callus.  Everything works best after a nice soak in warm water - so make that part of your treatment.  This is a great kit of quality tools.
800. On our farm, there are loads of dirty jobs that take their toll on nail and hands.  These gloves are great - they fit close enough that they don’t get in the way of most jobs - we use them in the kitchen - and in the lavender barn, moving plants around, watering, sprinkling fertilizer - everything! We like that they have long arms, to protect long sleeves.  They’re very sturdy and strong and we haven’t lost a pair yet!
801. Since I plugged this in a week ago, and my litter box cleaning days have not changed, I am having no odor at all  - revealing the existence of a cat in my house.  It makes almost no noise and the only indication that it is on is a soft blue light and a slight breeze.  I can’t attest to it creating a germless environment - how do you test that -  but just for the odor management, this is worth the price.  We are in the midst of allergy season, and I haven’t experienced  any lessening of symptoms, so it may not be much help with allergies.  If you have a cat or dog though, this is a winner!
802. These bring super comfort and support to favorite shoes.  They fit most of my shoes, and really make a difference in keeping me walking straight, with good posture.  So far, I am having less knee pain, and I can see some improvement in lower back discomfort.  Standing for any length of time was always a trial for me, and I can see improvement there as well.  Glad I tried these.
803. Sadly my trusted electronic tooth brush finally gave up so it was time to replace it. So I decided this one would work and it works just as well as my old one did. It has the same settings, with 30 second intervals for the different areas reminding me with a buzz that it is time to move to the next area.It charges with USB-C which is great, so no more extra cables when I travel, now I can consolidate and use the same cables for phone and tooth brush which is amazing. I feel that it cleanse my teeth quite well and have no complaints. The charge lasts significantly longer than it did on my old brush, amazing how much further tech got since I bought the old one.
804. I just wish they would stop this one size fits all stuff. I like that you can put it from one hand on the other which is great since this way you can get one if you only have occasional pain in one hand or the other. It fits quite well and works well too providing support and pain relief.The biggest problem, it is quite snug and I wish it was a bit bigger. Not everyone's wrist is the same size and the strap that wraps around the wrist either needs to be longer or they need to have different sizes. Other than that this is great.
805. This has been one crazy year. We have all had to get face masks or learn how to make our own. Thanks to COVID this has become a common day task that we wear these at work or out and about on errands and such. For some tasks I prefer wearing washable cloth masks and for others I prefer using a disposable type. At work we are only allowed to use the disposable N95 type masks but thankfully those are supplied to us.When I run errands or in my personal life I prefer to wear the more comfortable and reusable cloth masks. In this pack you get 2 black masks. In addition you get a storage pouch for when you are out and about to keep your mask in. You also get a pouch to wash your masks in. This is a nice set of masks that is very comfortable to wear. It fits very well above the nose and under the chin.  This one is very comfortable and fits well. The cotton is very soft and comfortable to wear. They have a metal clip on the nose to make them fit better. They also have adjustable loops to make sure the masks stay put and fit well. All int all this is a good mask that I like to wear quite a bit. At $15 this is not a bad price at all plus you can use the accessories for any of your other masks really.
806. I am always willing to try new things to see if they would help so when I saw these plums I figure why not. Plums have always had the reputation to help with digestive issues so I figured this may help. In this bag you only get 5 pieces that are all individually wrapped, and yes that means 5 pieces of plums for $18 !!!! Yes they are fermented a special way and undergo some special process but really? 5 plums, and we are talking tiny little plums for $18?The plums themselves do not taste good. They don’t taste horrible but they don’t taste good, not even close. I found they are just whatever really. You kind of just force them down and hope they help. Sadly I can’t really say that they helped, not even close. I think you would have to take quite a few of them to do that and at basically just over $3 per plum, that is just not going to happen, sorry.So it was worth the experiment but sad to say it was a failed experiment. Personally I will not replenish my used up stock and I can’t recommend others getting these but hey to each their own.
807. Sadly in this crazy year we all got to know face masks all too well. Thanks to COVID this has become a common day task that we wear these at work or out and about on errands and such. For some tasks I prefer wearing washable cloth masks and for others I prefer using a disposable type. In this pack you get 10 reusable, washable face masks for just $10, and as they say, you get what you pay for.The basically have the look and feel of disposable masks. They are three ply masks and are made of 2 layers. They are not adjustable in regards to the ear loops but you can adjust them at the nose a little bit with a nose clip. The material claims to be cotton but it is not the best material to be honest. I for one really do not like these very much. These are like back-up masks in my eyes when all my others are in the wash.I am sadly very underwhelmed with these. Thankfully they didn’t smell, that would have been too much if you ask me. These will provide at least following any mask mandates but I doubt there is any kind of serious protection with these.
808. Who doesn’t like bath bombs? Well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me. These bath bombs are great. They are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath. The fragrances these have are fantastic. I tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to “plain” vanilla.You get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over $20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it. These come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me. I will probably have to get these again when I am out. The only one I am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint, but that is because I just don’t like that fragrance but it will come in handy when I have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses.
809. This is a pretty good kit for making face masks a bit more tolerable and easier to be honest. For one you get 12 brackets that keep the face masks a bit more of your face. I like that these are washable and reusable. These don’t have a lot of material to them which is nice, makes them feel a lot more airy unlike some others. They do have little snags that helps you snag them onto the face masks, but the snags are not the greatest and it makes it not that easy to attach them to those 3 ply fold-able disposable face masks but you can make it work. More practice eventually leads in better results.Then you get 2 of those lanyard straps which I like. You can attach your face mask to that and when you don’t use it, like if you are out to dinner and you are eating and don’t have a place to put it, you can just hang it around your neck instead. I really like this so much better than any other solution out there like those little wallets for face masks.Lastly you get those ear protectors, little straps that you can attach the face masks behind your head to instead of securing the face masks to your ear and straining your ears. You get a lot of them. These are fairly cheap but they work. You get so many in fact that if they break who cares and you have still so many that you can share with friends, family and coworkers if you are so inclined. All this for $17, not a bad deal really. I think it is worth it and all these little gadgets help making wear masks a little bit more tolerable.
810. These are very nice essential oil roll-ons. You get a total of 4 different blends in this little relaxation kits. The tranquility  blend is a mix of vetiver, cedarwood and chamomile. It is a very nice woodsy aroma that smells great. The piece out blend is a mi of lavender, orange and bergamot, probably my favorite. It is a beautiful blend that is just perfect to apply before you head to bed. Tension is a blend that contains peppermint and wintergreen and to be honest I am not a huge fan to that one, mostly because I am rather sensitive to mind. Ache is the last one and contains Arnica and Frankincense to help with inflammation bruising and sprains. That one smells a bit rougher but it is supposed to help with inflammation and does seem to help maybe a little bit.That one is applied directly to the affected area while tension is applied best to the temples since it helps with headaches a little bit. The other two can be applied to the temples or pulse points to distribute their effects. These are easy to apply and use. Their scents are pretty mild and sadly do fade fairly quickly all considering. I like that they come in these easy little applicator roll-ons that are easy to bring along really. All in all nice little set that also makes for a good gift.
811. These are nice makeup removal pads. You get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution. And of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads. These makeup pads are very nice and work well. The removal solution is very gentle, probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredients.They smell very good and I found are gentle enough to use around the eyes. I had no issues removing foundation, lipsticks are eye makeup. All in all I am very happy with these. The price is rather reasonable too at $12 for 70 of these pads. I think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant. But since these are gentle enough to use around the eyes they should be good for sensitive skin.
812. I like these face mask lanyards. They are perfect to attach your face masks to. You attach one end to each side of your face masks. Then when you don’t use your face mask, like for example if you are taking a break to eat or you are at a restaurant, you can then take it down and just hang it around your neck using this lanyard. No more leaving it on the desk, putting it over your thigh or anything like that. So much easier and better. Especially when you are out for dinner I always struggle on what to do with it and this is the solution. Or when you are driving in your car and you just need to put it away for a bit, this is the solution. These can also be used as ear extenders  ear savers meaning  the face mask is attached to the lanyard and around the head, relieving the pressure on the ears.I like it because it makes it easy to put the face mask safely away but close by and you don’t have to put them down anywhere but instead they hang around your neck. In this pack you get 4 of them for just $16. These are definitely some of the more expensive ones out there and not sure why they are more expensive, because of the “design”?  I always keep some around since it is easy to misplace them and I just keep them on the various cloth masks I have in the car and so on so having a few of the on hand is very handy.
813. When I read mini dustpan, I thought this one would be a little bit smaller than it is. It is pretty small but I was hoping a little smaller. I do like it though and it is very versatile. The pan makes collecting the dirt easy. The brush has a brush side on one end and a squeegee side on another. This is perfect for making sure you get all the dirt.I like that the brush neatly stores within the pan. In addition they give you a small little brush that works very well in cleaning out dirt from your keyboard or other small areas. I actually use this for cleaning out the cage of my flying squirrels, it makes a job that usually takes me closer to 5 to 10 minutes a 1 minute task.The materials are also perfect that if they ever get dirty you can just clean it easily with soap and water.
814. These are good earplugs. They work well in reducing noise and protect your hearing but they will not completely drown out all noise. You get a cute little carrying case with a carabiner that let's you attach it to your purse or luggage or whatever really. Inside the case is a sturdy foam with 6 holes in it in which the 3 pairs of earplugs are inserted into. Each pair has different colored plastic so you can keep the pairs together.The earplugs fit very well and I have had no issues with them falling out. The soft silicone material is actually pretty comfortable. The way these are made you can actually lay on your side sleeping and be comfortable with them. They reduce noise nicely but you can still hear what is going on to some degree.These are well made. The materials are nice and can easily be washed. You can take the silicon of the plastic to allow proper cleaning of both really. When not in use you can store everything safely in the carrying case.
815. Exactly what I was looking for. I take a few different medicines and one I have to on occasion split into half. To date I used a knife but that didn't usually work too well, but since it was a once in a while thing I made it work. I figured it was time and get a pill splitter. This one is perfect. Small and easy to use and in my eyes cute. It works well and you don't loose your pill halves after you are done either. Exactly what needed.
816. This is just an average hydration supplement in my eyes. First of it comes at 160 calories for one serving, which I think is rather high. Most energy workout boosters come at like 50 calories or less but this one has quite a bit of sugar in it. It does have a good amount of electrolytes so that is nice, you can basically make your own quick version of Gatorade of sorts. Again a lot of calories though. The electrolytes are mostly sodium and potassium, both important for muscle function and many other functions inside the human body.I tend to dilute it more than instructed since it is pretty sweet. The taste is not bad but among the energy boosters I have tried this is not my favorite, it is ok. I have had no negative reactions to this but didn't really feel any energy boosting effects from this at all since they do claim some energy boosting effects calling it an energy blend.All in all this is just ok. You do get a massive amount for the $20 though so you can make a lot of home made "Gatorade" with this really. I won't reorder this though.
817. This is a nice supplement by Hair Envy. You get easy to swallow capsules that are tasteless really. It has a lot of Biotin and Keratin in it that will help you grow strong and healthy hair. This is also good for your skin and nails. I think taking a supplement works better than a topical application (i.e. shampoo or conditioner) but trying both may work best?My nails have been breaking a lot and my hair is on the thinner side. So it is more than time to do something about it. Taking this supplement has definitely helped, I can notice the difference in my nails. Seeing a difference in the hair will take a long time, especially if you have long hair like myself. Mine goes half way down my back at this point so seeing and improvement will take time.
818. This is a cute little gadget. It is very inexpensive and probably not the most accurate instrument out there, however I do like it to get a rough idea on how much blood alcohol level I have. Would I stake my drivers license on this, of course not but it is nice to get an idea on where I am standing really. It is not completely inaccurate or anything but in the grand scheme of things you get what you pay for.What I do like is the convenience of it really. Also make sure when you start it up that you let it calibrate with fresh air to make sure you get a good baseline. If you don't do that your results are going to be VERY bad. It is very easy to use so no complaints there. Also the complaint about it fogging up is accurate but you can still read the measurement on the display, so no real big deal in my eyes.
819. This is a nice cleaning bundle. You get one bottle that is a streak-less glass cleaner that you can use on either glass surfaces or mirrors. I have had no issues with this and indeed it is streak-less. It works very well and it is pretty much ammonia based like most others are.The other bottle is an all purpose cleaner that works very well on pretty much everything else like your shower, cook top with a greasy mess and everything else that your cleaning hands come across. These 2 cleaners work very well. They smell like cleaning supplies do so no surprise there really.
820. This is a nice preworkout booster. First off it tasted good of raspberry and lime. One scoop gives you a solid 16oz drink if you don't want a super sweet drink that is and it was pretty sweet to be honest so I diluted it a little more than they suggested.When I went to exercise I definitely had more energy and longer staying power. I had no issues falling asleep later that night, which was about 6 hours after I drank this. I had no jitters or any other negative side effects from this during or after. This is definitely a workout supplement that works.
821. This facial skin scrubber is not a bad little gadget. It has an easy to clean stainless steel spatula. The unit has 3 different settings, cleaning and moisturizing which are similar to each other and uplifting that is definitely different on how it vibrates on your skin.When you use it, it definitely feels interesting on your skin. When you use the cleaning and moisturizing settings you should use a cleaning solution or moisturizing solution of sort.The facial scrubber is a nice lightweight little unit that sits comfortably in your hand. It is very easy to operate and easy to use, you just have to figure out which setting you want to use. I really like using this. It is much gentler in cleaning blackheads and such then squeezing them with your fingers or using those blackhead tools that often damage your skin and also hurt. This is nice and gentle and actually feels good. It is not very expensive either so a nice little investment for your skin that should be worth it.
822. This is a very nice toothpaste. It is definitely funky using toothpaste that is black but you get used to it. It tastes pretty good and cleanse your teeth very well. I would recommend mixing it up with regular toothpaste though because it can strip your teeth because of the charcoal. It does have some bad breath eliminating features which I like and it can help whiten your teeth, don't expect to have like bright white teeth because of this but it can neutralize some stains which is nice. I really like this one but I am not making this my own and only toothpaste but actually rotate it with another one I use.
823. This is a great little toner. The spray has a fine little mist and works very well. I cleanses my face beautifully and feels very refreshing when I use it. After I use this my face feels nice and clean. I do like the smell of this and feel super refreshed every time I use this. I do like that this has witch hazel in the ingredient list which is a very calming ingredient. It also has other fantastic ingredients like chamomile and ginseng.This is a great find and am happy I found this toner.
824. This is a very nice roll on stick with hemp oil and lavender. It smells beautiful of lavender. It is a very nice lavender scent, much nicer actually than some of the diffuser oils I have found, very smooth and just plain beautiful.The oil feels great on the skin and I had no negative reactions to it. I enjoy applying it before I go to sleep because I enjoy the scent because I feel it is calming.When I got mine in the mail it did leak and there was a good amount in the bubble wrap that it was wrapped in. Seems this is a common problem so I hope they fix it since it is a shame that this product gets wasted like that!
825. These are nice little travel packs to bring along in a pinch when you are out of smaller tooth paste and mouth wash, plus a small size of spritz breath spray. These packs are very small and easy to store and bring along. These work pretty well. I am not a huge fan of the breath spray, but that is just because I don't generally use them so I wish they would have included more mouth wash and tooth paste since those I use a lot more.
826. I got this flavored sparkling water with the dragon fruit flavor. Before I drank it, it was nicely chilled. Sadly this did not help the overall experience. I know it has a lot of good for you ingredients, but sadly I couldn't stand this beverage at all!It says zero calories, zero sweetener, zero carbs, zero sugar, but sadly I have to say horrible flavor!To me this is a complete miss. I struggled drinking one can of this and now I have 11 more in my fridge. I wish this would have been better. Now I wish I would have gotten the variety pack to see if any of the other flavors would have been better but I didn't.
827. This earmuffseye mask combination is pretty neat. It is one piece that combines an eye mask with earmuffs to give you better sleep. The straps are adjustable to make them tighter or looser obviously and fit better for your needs. I found I don't like it super tight since that makes it a bit uncomfortable on the eyes especially if you end up opening your eyes at one point while wearing the mask.The mask is soft so if you do open your eyes at some point your eye lashes will touch the mask, that is a tad annoying but not a deal breaker since you should be sleeping anyways. The earmuffs are pretty noise insulating but do not block out all noise. But I found they do a pretty good job. For those who like to sleep on the side these are soft and comfortable enough to do so, although for an entire night on the same side I don't think it is optimal. I move around from the sides to back a bit so this worked well for me.They are pretty well made in my eyes so they should last a good amount of time. I think the thing that will probably go first are the straps that hold everything together. These should be great especially on a flight if you are trying to get a little snooze. All in all not a bad purchase.
828. This gloves are perfect for dish washing or other household cleaning duties. They keep your hands protect nicely during all these duties we love so dearly, not. They are a good quality product that should stand up the test of time quite nicely, only time will tell. These gloves come with a cotton flocking that makes wearing them nice and comfortable and absorbs your sweat to some degree. Getting a pair of these for $10 is very good so I can recommend purchasing these for sure!
829. these masks we toss-aways, unless you have a small child, these are uselessly small - what a waste
830. Ok product low rating due to small loops on belt
831. Bought this for my sister to improve her grip strength. she loves it and it's adorable too
832. Maybe not the best razor ever, but does a good job. Easy to clean.
833. I love the fit, comfort and my safety with this mask and the filters.  However,  these protect YOU but NOT OTHERS (due to the value).  I will continue to use mine during my infrequent outings and errands, but will put electrical tape on valve.  Be aware that some airlines will not allow you to board with valve masks.
834. Each Pak is light & easy to use and very compact when used up. Each 15 flush Pak comes with garbage bag you insert in the bowl first so that clean up is a whiz! I’m a camper and the Laveo allows me to offer guests their own bathroom with no mess and no smell.
835. Perfect for traveling, or for home.
836. I was pleased at first but now I am not.  NO matter how long I leave my contacts in, my eyes burn from this solution..  Even after I rinsed my lenses with saline solution they still burned my eyes.  SO I stopped using this and went back to Bausch and Lomb Bio True lens solution!
837. Great glasses for the price.
838. This works but you cannot apply pressure or the brush stops spinning.  Great concept but if you lightly brush tiles and the bath, it will not clean.  You're better off manually scrubbing your tiles and bath with an ordinary brush.
839. These bath bombs pack a punch, which you wouldn't expect from their size.  They might have more color added than expected, which spreads in the bath pretty quickly.  They smell great, but aren't overwhelming.  If you're looking for a nice set of bath bombs, these are a great selection.
840. I suffer from consistently low levels of Vitamin B12 due to a pancreatic issue that I have.  I already get monthly shots, but my levels remain low, so I decided to get this liquid version for a quick pick me up outside of my daily vitamins.  I will admit that I noticed a bit of a pick me up from these, when added to my diet.  The raspberry flavor is pretty strong, but I always follow it with a drink of something else that has a strong flavor and it's fine.  I'm very happy with this supplement though and will be picking these up again when I run out!
841. I LOVE Vital Proteins, so when I saw that they came out with a Collagen Whey I had to have it. I ordered the Banana, Cinnamon and Vanilla flavor and I was so excited to try it right away when it arrived. The taste and the texture of this new product is almost unbearable. I used the suggested serving size with the appropriate amount of liquid and it tastes so watered down and gritty. I have to take it in several shots to finish it. In the future, I will stick to the original non-flavored collegen protein. It was worth a try, but definitely not what I expected.
842. Completely ineffective. Please don’t bother .
843. This is a good solid pre-workout. The energy is strong. The beta alanine itches. The pumps are big. And the flavor ain't bad. I would do this one again.
844. Decent flavor. Taste similar to some name brands I have tried. Filled me up for the morning. Not too grainy. Love how much nutrition is packed in each drink. The bottle is also a nice size.
845. Great product. Fast delivery.
846. Yes,  I bought this because it is KLEENIX.  I knew it would be soft and especially absorbent.  There is no fragrance,  just simple softness.  And,  reason for absorbency?  TWO PLY!
847. I have been washing dishes a lot, since the dishwasher was not doing its job!!  But,  I believe I got the Medium size,  and they fit good, but not tight.  I have small hands,  and the Medium is not tight,  and not loose.  I can take them off easily and put them on easier.Washing dishes is tough for rubber gloves!  Knives and forks often make holes.  And,  these gloves are still going for me.  I like them.  They last long,  and no holes after many uses.  I have several pairs of these for the bathroom and kitchen!  Strong gloves,  last long!
848. I have been using these for dishwashing and they are little big for me,  but they are workable!  I have used the other pair for bathroom cleaning and same thing.  They hold well enough.  They have long sleeves and seem to be really good quality.  Great cleaning and dishwashing gloves!
849. This Gel Knee Support comes in handy when I have a weak knee.  Periodically, my knee tends to give out.  With this, I feel much more support to the area.  This is a nice, quality support with Gel padding on the front where the front of the knee is.The material is strong,  and most important breathable.  Oftentimes, if you don't have breathing material, it can become tight and sweaty.  There is no opening, just slip if through the food.  I can do this while exercising, because staying in place is important.Check the sizes for sure before you order.  Mine is the X-large, and I am not large, but the tightness is fine.  Maybe I should have received a smaller one, but  right now this one works.Nice support.  Good quality fit.....  Review for Gel Knee Support
850. The arm stand is definitely not sturdy and should not be relied on.
851. I tried using this for a few days and the hardness of the plastic really bothered me. The literature that came with the item did say the plastic was hard and it might take you some time to get used to it, but I got headaches and only used it a short time.I did keep it and may try using it again.
852. 5 stars for product quality, 1 star for packaging.The top part of the cap, that flips open and closed, was broken into multiple pieces, with the hinge part missing and only a little plastic left to seal the hole. Thank goodness the bottle is sealed under the cap, or everything would've spilled out. Without the proper cap, I can't travel with this as planned. I'm very disappointed. It came in a bubble wrap envelope.
853. I wore these one time and the second time I went to put them on my finger ripped right through the material and there is now a huge hole in the thigh.
854. Poor cleaner, does not make me feel like the mat is clean after wiping down. Smells nice though.
855. I saw in a few reviews that people felt these were shipped too close to the expiration date. Received on 4212018, expiration date is 072019. My dog requires multiple pills per day, so this is a great solution for her.
856. This is a good deal and a great product…
857. I cannot use it, it’s crammed into the case it came in and cannot be removed. Broke carry case to get I out. I bought this for the carry case...the file is nice just the case is the issue
858. I have been taking these daily for a month now and am pleased with the results. Good quality vitamin D3 at a fair price.
859. I enjoy the form and bioavailability of this magnesium. I've been taking it for a couple of months now and have been pleased with the results.
860. These masks are, in my opinion, as effective as standard N95 masks and at least as comfortable to wear. They fold-up very nearly and tend to last me about a week each. The ear strings are comfortable and stretch easily. They're a bit sharp on the back of my ears, but not unbearably.
861. This is a pretty solid trimmer set for the price.  You get everything you need to maintain your beard, hairline, etc. and all of the attachments are pretty well-made. It works smoothly, is easy to keep clean, and the battery lasts quite a while between charges.
862. These pills have a pretty pungent odor, but oddly I don't taste it or burp it up. I'm pretty happy with the results I'm getting after taking them for about a week. They're definitely useful for flushing out the system and the ingredients seem to be of good quality. I'd say they're worth giving a try.
863. I've had very good results using this toothpaste after a couple of weeks. It's very pleasant to use, with a nice aftertaste, and it leaves my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean. I have noticed some whitening, as well. Three tubes for the current price of $18.99 is a decent deal.
864. This stuff actually works. I use it to spray my gym sneakers and it neutralizes the scent. It has very little scent itself, too.
865. works well. Easy to setup. very accurate. Use it with Hoyer lift and sling to weigh wheelchair bound person that can't stand on a normal scale.
866. I use only 14 to 12 tsp. If I have leg cramps, this works the best! My dad had hand cramps and within 15 mins of giving him 12 tsp, the cramps were gone. I love that I can vary the dose.  Check out Dr. Carolyn Dean.
867. I can't explain how many different places  companies I've tried this is good if you shift around and like to shake your booty some people say it collapses yeah it does but I don't know it's a good option if you move in your seat and want a little refreshment
868. As a husband who recently picked up the Heated Sleep Eye Mask by CareFor for my wife, I am happy to say that she absolutely loves it! This eye mask has been a game-changer for her nighttime routine, as it quickly heats up and stays warm for a long time, providing her with the perfect amount of relaxation and comfort.One of the things that stands out about this eye mask is its 3D ergonomic design. It perfectly contours to her face, blocking out all light and allowing her to completely relax. The graphene material used in the mask is top-quality, ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed and that she remains comfortable throughout the night.The magnet suction wire is also a great feature, as it keeps the mask securely in place without any discomfort or slipping. My wife also loves how breathable and soft the mask is, which helps prevent any irritation or sweating around the eyes.Overall, the Heated Sleep Eye Mask by CareFor is a must-have for anyone who struggles with migraines, dry eyes, or just wants a more relaxing and comfortable sleep. It's also perfect for nap time or travel, making it a versatile and useful addition to any routine. Highly recommended!
869. These work well for me.  They are the right softness and I have no complaints.  The only thing is that I need glasses to see, my current toothpaste is green, the same color as the brush, and it is hard for me to see how much I have on the bristles.  LOL  My next tube of toothpaste will be a different color.Anyway,  these do work well for me and I am happy to have them.
870. I have a huge supply of misc. vitamins.  I take one of these daily along with one other brand mini vitamin.  These will let you know when you take them.  Quickly after taking one, your urine will be neon yellow.I like the list of ingredients and have zero complaints about this product.I am happy to have these and will continue to use them.
871. I have been trying to up my intake of antioxidants and polyphenols.  I can't attest to the fact that this helps but I am rotating it in and out of my daily supplements.I now ALWAYS look for made in the USA.  This has become very important to me, whether it is supplements for me or the dogs.I will continue taking these.  I have not had any problems at all with these.
872. Like many of you, I have persistent neck pain.  This looked great.  Don't be fooled.  I disliked this so much that I threw it away.  I had my wife try it out to make sure it was not just me.  She did not like it at all either.I tried this many times, never ever did I think it did anything.  I hate to say this, but this is a waste of time and money.
873. This is my third order of this.  We both like them.  The taste is good and even better when mixed with a little orange juice.  This is a good way for us to get added electrolytes and also get vitamins.We like this and are happy to have it.
874. I mixed up some of this today with cold water and milk with some ice cubes.  It mixed very well.  I gave my wife a taste, she is pickier than I am on these things.  She liked it.  We both liked it.I appreciate very much that it is MADE IN THE USA.  I really appreciate the grams of fiber along with added vitamins.The only concern I have is the price to re-order when it runs out.  At almost two dollars a serving, it is higher than the others I drink.  But then again, this one has fiber and I don't think any of my other ones do.We like it and will continue to drink it.
875. We have several similar products in the house.  During this Covid19 we try to take our vitamins and stay hydrated.  This is a very nice item to have around.  My wife and I are actually both drinking one now.My biggest complaint is the salty taste.  I know, I know it has salt for electrolytes but my other main one we drink doesn't have this salty taste.  I just chugged half the bottle and then refilled it with cold water.  I like it better when it is diluted.  Next time I will just use 12 of one tube in my bottle of water.I do appreciate the vitamins and will continue to use this.
876. These are what I was looking for and do what I needed them to do.  I am happy with them.
877. Have you ever tried to get a tiny screw put back into your glasses only to find you can't?  Don't have the right tools?  That was me when I tried to put a screw back into my mother's glasses.  This kit has the right tools that I needed.This kit appears to me to be a great variety of anything I may ever need to fix eyeglasses.  I have tried to show pics of the various pages that show the contents.This kit just might be a lifesaver in the future.  I am happy to have it.
878. We take probiotics often and I try to switch up the brands since they all seem to have different strains in them.  This will make a nice addition to my collection and we will rotate them in and out of our daily routine.
879. I got these for my wife.  She tells me they are easy to take but she really can't tell if they make any difference.  Sorry.
880. We have a big variety of probiotics that we rotate and use daily.  This one has a very impressive label.  Now, I have no way to test any of these claims, so I just have to believe them.  This one gives more capsules for less money than many others, all-the-while giving lots of CFU's.Not long before the Covid19 outbreak, I had to take another round of antibiotics.  Since this wipes out all of the good bacteria in my intestines, I stocked up on several different pre + probiotics.  My thoughts are that different brands may have different types of good bacteria.After about two weeks of some serious probiotic dosages, which was also in the middle of the Covid19 outbreak, I got sick.  I had a fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  It really started to worry me.  It only lasted two days and was gone.  I have no proof but I am going to say that my pre and probiotics kept me from getting much sicker and also shortened the duration of my illness.
881. I am middle aged and unfortunately I think going through menopause. As a result, my hair is getting thin. Only time will tell if these are effective in terms of better hair, skin and nails.  Wellforia hair gummies will hopefully strengthen my hair giving me a head of healthy hair. The package contains 60 gummies. You take 2 per serving. (1 month supply). They are:1. Shaped like gummy bears.2. Tastes great (berry flavored).3. They are easy to chew. Not as firm as a gummy bear but not as soft as a Swedish fish.4. Contain biotin, retinol, folic acid, Vitamins A, C, D, And E.5. Affordable ($17 on Amazon).
882. These inexpensive mask extenderslanyards by Moosth are useful. We are living through a pandemic where most places require a mask. I am sure that I am not the only one who finds that taking on and off the mask is cumbersome. Etiquette says that you don’t let your mask hang from one ear or on your chin, so these lanyards definite alleviate that problem. They allow you to keep your mask around your neck. No need to remove it, shove it in your pocket or wear inappropriately. Not only that but how many times have you found your mask pulling on your ears. These extenders reduce that pull on them. You attach, adjust it and there is no pressure on your ears, which is nice. Overall, for the price, these are a nice find. You get 5 for $5.00. I give them 4 stars.
883. I don’t know why I never thought about getting a pill box in the past, especially since I usually grab an empty medicine bottle (to carry Benadryl, aspirin etc) when I go out of town. And I always say to myself, I don’t want to mix my pills, but I also don’t want to carry multiple prescription bottles. So when I was offered these for an honest review, I said to myself, this really makes so much sense. And guess what? It does. Lizimandu has created some beautiful pill boxes, inspired by Van Gogh. These are perfect for people who travel or who have to take medicine on a regular basis. Each pill box is divided into 3 compartments. They are small enough to fit inside your purse, travelmakeup bag or book-bag. They aren’t that expensive and would be perfect to give as gifts. The only reason I am deducting a half of star is because I believe having a removable option (for the compartment) would allow people to put larger pills inside. Perhaps having the ability to twist the compartment and remove it would have made this 5 stars.
884. Viva Naturals Collagen Protein Powder has no flavor or smell (i.e., tasteless and odorless). You can blend this non-dairy supplement with any beverage. My husband added this protein with orange juice. It mixes well. He could not taste the product, nor was it gritty. Each serving (there are 30 per 23.7 ounce container) is 90 calories and contains 21 grams of protein.  This product is gluten and lactose free.  It is easy to drinkswallow. The collagen used is: grass-fed Bovine, Wild Cod and Chicken. This collagenprotein powder promotes healthy bones and strengthens your joints. And finally, the cylinder-shaped container while large can be kept in any cabinet easily. My husband recommends it.
885. What is better than some Puff Facial tissues when you have a sore, runny nose? Nothing. These are soft and even contain some lotion, which means that hopefully you will be able to avoid that red, irritated nose that often results from a bad cold. The cube shaped box contains 52 soft tissues. This 10 pack can be divided and used in multiple places. I have a box on my desk at work; one in my car; and others strategically placed around my house.
886. Very slippery. Shifts in shoe.
887. This is my go to on those days I need a little extra push, and I love the individual packs.
888. Some of them fit and are a really neat concept but all of them are basically cut different sizes and shapes. I would rather have something tighter fitting to use a device. All of the finger lengths are random. A stretchy fabric would be helpful, even a 5050 cotton blend.
889. Doesn't seem to be catching enough hair or fur!
890. I mean, yeah, it makes it convenient. It is a complete mineral profile. I like that about it. But sadly, it uses inferior forms of some minerals. They used calcium carbonate, which is one of the most poorly absorbed calciums (citrate is what you want), as well as magnesium oxide, which is also poorly absorbed - you want malate or gycinate. That made me a bit disappointed in this product. It's not too hard to swallow and goes down easy, but in the end...it's not the best.
891. So far out of all the diabetic bags I have purchased I keep coming back to this case. It fits my insulin pen, my napkins (when out to dinner and have a sanitary place to lay my stuff out), my meter pouch, alcohol wipes and needles. And it fits in my purse. I like it. and there is a small pocket to put an ice pack if needed.  I like it it so far. I just purchased the Sarah Spunda By Dittibags (also sold on Amazon) bag to see how that will work for my diabetic needs. Suppose to arrive today. I wanted something cute and feminine to carry my stuff but if the comments are accurate then I will be going back to this case!
892. Could be just a tad larger.  I have a small face and they just fit.
893. I love trying different protein flavors to switch it up from my normal vanilla. This piña colada one is definitely a new favorite!! The flavor is spot on and not too sweet or artificial flavored. One of my favorite ways to enjoy this is mixed into some plain greek yogurt. I serve myself a half cup to a full cup, mix in a half to full scoop and then let it chill again a little bit before eating. It completely erases any hint of whey powder and it's just a nice sweet treat (that's high in protein and low sugar!). It dissolves easily in yogurt as well as in milk when I use it for shakes. I didn't experience any bloating or digestive issues. Highly recommend if you're looking to try new flavor!:)Hope this review is helpful!:)
894. This set is so stinking cute, I love how every tool matches the case perfectly. However o don't feel like these tools warrant the price.: They feel a bit flimsy and the clippers especially aren't as sharp as some of my drugstore bought nail clippers. If this was only about $10 Id think it was worth it, but def not worth +$20 imo
895. I hate how so many supplements use artificial sweeteners that make everything so sickeningly sweet. This protein powder is actually not as sweet as many that I've tried. Definitely more of a natural amount of sweetness that I really appreciate! Tastes just like a sweetened, creamy latte. I add this to my morning coffee and it's just perfect!This doesn't state whether it has caffeine in it or not, but I don't believe it does despite the cold brew flavor.The reason I took a star off was the packaging. I was super excited to receive a bagged protein powder because the super large (and usually half empty) containers of protein powders take up so much counter space. Unfortunately, it just doesn't seal back up very well. Did not feel air tight at all. I didn't want it to lose freshness so I just put it in a different container. Wish the sealing strip had worked better.:(
896. These sponges and steel wool aren't any better quality than a brand you'd be able to find in store for a fraction of the price. Steel wool isn't bad, but the sponges definitely won't last long. They're the very light and soft type of sponges that fall apart easily if you do a lot of hand washing.
897. Pretty sweet and has the artificial taste of an orange starburst, not really a flavor I want in a drink. Someone that doesn't mind artificially sweetened drinks may not find the flavor to be an issue.Would highly recommend using cold water to drink this down because it helps cut the sickly sweetness.I took half a scoop midday which comes out to 125mg of caffeine, about the strength of a cup of coffee.I didn't feel too jittery, anxious or crazy just a little more "up" and focused during my workout.So overall I didn't care too much for the flavor, but I enjoy the effects so I'll continue to use it, and just drink it quickly. haha
898. Spirulina powder is kind of one of those trendy health supplements right now, so I'm not surprised by the price, especially for an organic product.Easy to add into green smoothies and such, if you don't put a crazy amount, the flavor is pretty easily hidden, not bad!
899. I had recently bought some inexpensive sleep masks and instantly felt the difference in quality when I received these.These are so much softer and silkier than my other pair, they really feel like a little pillow on your eyes. The strap to adjust the tightness in the back doesn't look the nicest but it's functional.They're very opaque so they block out the light well and don't feel heavy on the face. They're also a good size so no light filters in through the topsidesnosebridge Definitely comfortable to sleep intravel with.The fact that they're silk is an added plus for anyone concerned with damaging their eyelashes or even eyebrows in their sleep.Great sleep masks!
900. These look quite classy with the brushed finish as opposed to the chrome plating on most clippers. The little tin is a nice touch. I’m definitely going to use that for something else.
901. We bought these and a couple other types. By far these are the best. In others the inner lining was too lose after the first wash to breath easily. These are very soft material but also thick enough to wear for the pandemic. My son is a smaller 6 year old and it’s a tiny bit lose by his cheeks but otherwise fits well.
902. -Colors match picture-Mix of vibrant black and grey-Material is a little tough-seems very tight, making it kind of hard-lathers okay, but not so good because of how tight it is-used it about 3 times so far and seems to be loosening up
903. I received the bluewhite gloves and the purple gloves and they seem to differ. The bluewhite gloves seemed really shinyslippery. I received a size large, but could have used a medium so I would say they are true to size. The purple gloves seemed thicker than the bluewhite gloves and less shinyslippery. They have a swirly design on the inside which helps with grip. The inside feels soft, like there's actual cloth material inside. They would make great for washing dishes and cleaning because of the thickness. I'd reccommend this item.
904. Bought one at that Walmart for two dollars long ago.  Since then I've tried several others.  Came back to these and bought several, even though they are more expensive here.
905. It was fully charged yet the music stopped working. I believe the buttons were getting stuck. So I returned it
906. These are great for overnight wear, but the thigh band rolls down during the night and can get uncomfortable.
907. I used to have a Clarisonic but lost it after a move. This is a great replacement. I like the feeling that my face is super clean and super smooth. It’s easy to use, easy to handle and dose a good job. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t bother it.
908. I’ve gone back to natural nails and needed files for them. I knew the 240 would be okay and was hoping the 180 would work. It does the job but I only use the 180 side for shortening my nails, it’s a bit rough and isn’t at all good for shaping. That being said, the 240 is what I was looking for and it’s easy enough to tell the difference so you don’t use the wrong side.
909. I'm a true believer in the red light therapy camp. I've had excellent results myself and have seen the same on others. That being said, I have a bad neck and was hoping this would be flexible enough to use there and hopefully improve it. It does the job but is really hard to get it into place. It's easier on my shoulder or leg but I wish it was curved in shape for where I need it. I'll definitely use this but am still in search of.....
910. Time in front of the computer and general wear and tear so sometimes I have a real problem with my neck. Unfortunately it affects my shoulders, back, arms and hands too so I'm always looking for something to ease the tightness. This works well and is easy to use. It's adjustable so I have options and stores in a small space. It's a regular 'guest' in my suitcase when I travel and I don't leave home without it anymore.
911. I’ve had great luck with red light therapy for both wounds and aches and pains. This is easy to set up and use and does a great job. If you haven’t looked into red light therapy, you should. I won’t go into the science since I’m not sure exactly what’s been proven and what’s been theorized but I know it works for me. I like the durability of this unit and its easy to use. I can’t swear to the effectiveness of what it works on beneath the surface but I do know if helps cuts and bruises heal much more quickly so I’ll continue to use it. This is a great until. A decent size and I can leave it set up. I do know that you have to be really close to get the full effect so if you’ve tried it without success, maybe move closer?
912. I have VERY sensitive skin and a lot of things irritate it so I’m always worried when I try something new. I spot test and wait, spot test and wait. This product doesn’t irritate my skin! First winning feature. It’s a milky toner which made me wonder but it’s moisturizing and balancing. It feels nice, allows me to skip additional moisturizing (normal combination skin) and leaves my skin clear and bright. Love this product and will buy more when this bottle is used up. Absolutely NO irritation.
913. While YMMV, I found this unpleasant to use and very irritating to my sensitive teeth. I've tried others and had a similar problem but this was almost right out of the gate. The pen is harder to use than a tray or strips because it's hard to get into nooks and crannies but they generally do work. I just couldn't deal with the sensitivity. A hard no for me!
914. I'm not totally sure this is helping. This whole pandemic thing has messed with everything but the fact that these are a capsule instead of a powder is a winner for me. I can't stand the taste of most of those things and just that alone is a turn off. I was totally skeptical but while I'm not sure how much of a benefit they are, I can say that they haven't caused any negatives so that alone makes them worth a try.
915. This does work fairly well and after a bit of fiddling (my problem not the curler’s) I got it working well. It’s still an extra step I don’t always do just because of the extra time — getting set up, using it and putting it away — but when I want to go all out, this does a great job. It’s easy to use and does work.
916. While there are a bunch of braces for support during the day for carpal tunnel, this one does work. It's small enough to not get in the way of anything except moving your wrist. It's also useable on either side. My gripe is it isn't the most comfortable (more likely the shape and size of my hand) than some I've used. And it's a bit hot to wear.
917. While it's not a new neck, it does help keep the existing one freer from strain and tension. It fits right at the bend of the neck and if you lay on it regularly it helps ease shoulder tension. I put it on the floor and just relax into it and it works the best. If I'm trying to watch TV or something it doesn't have the same effect but just relaxing (or listening to an audiobook, music, podcast) it's very effective.
918. I was going to try this and then give it to my sister who suffers with "real" headaches. I tried it and I'm not going to give it away. It feels wonderful, I like that I can spritz it and make it moist heat and the fabric feels wonderful against my face and eyes. The cord is a bit problematic. I'm going to try using it with a battery pack and see if that fixes "the problem". Also will make a good gift for those that do the whole sinus thing or need a nice dark eye mask.
919. I had planned to give this less than 3 stars because I did not see a big significant change at first. It just so happened that I had something that was in my fridge that could potential have been a problem and I had this in my fridge and it did not stink my fridge up. I am a believer that this works. I only wish that I did not have to put it in the sun once a month because the winter months are coming and we might not have that much sun soon. Overall though I highly recommend it.
920. I have issues with severe pain at night down my legs due to damage from a local tower which has caused many issues with many people.  I need to have some good sources of pain relief topically so I can sleep at night.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a tube.  You take off th seal and then you use the flip top to dispense the cream.TEXTUREThis cream is very thin and it can easily be squeezed out too quickly if you are not careful.  Once applied, it is not sticky or tacky and absorbs in pretty quickly.SMELLThere is a minty menthol smell, but it is not too bad compared to some creams.DOES IT HELP?I get about an hour or two of relief after using this.  I primarily use this at night and it does help me sleep a bit.  It does not seem to work longer than two hours tops, but I am thankful for anything.THE BOTTOM LINEThis cream helps me get an hour or two of relief at night from pretty intense pain.  It does not burn or give me problems but is a bit thin so you have to be cautious.MY RATINGFOUR STARS.  If this was just a little bit thicker, it would be easier to use.  Other than that, it is pretty good stuff.  It is too expensive to waste by spilling out by accident.
921. I originally got this when I was going to use it in my sewing room.  Things changed and it made its way into a storage area in my living room.  Finally I brought it out, set it up and have been using it ever since.FLOOR STANDThis has a heavy floor stand and it works well to hold the lamp steady.LIGHT CONTROLThe controls go from high to medium and off.  It is easy to hit the rocker switch sitting in a chair.LIGHT QUALITYThis light is fantastic quality.  I can see well when doing artwork, knitting, or sewing.  The colors are true and vivid and contrast is excellent.NECKThe only wear that this has had is the neck cover cracked.  It does not affect operation of the light, however.BULBI am still on the original bulb, but bought a backup in case.THE BOTTOM LINEThis light is fantastic.  It works great, provides fantastic light and is my go to for artwork, sewing, or knitting.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I would buy this again no problem if it is the same quality is the one I have now.
922. When I first got this, I expected it to be brown like other products from these sources.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a large plastic bottle.  There is a seal on top that needs to be removed.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?Instead of brown like other products made from these sources, this is clear.  There is no flavor or scent.  Shaking it up does not seem to change that.FLAVOR?No flavor.HOW TO TAKEI take a teaspoon of this once a day in the morning in a small cup of water.DOES IT DO ANYTHING?I seem to see a bit of support in energy, sleep, and overall.  I am taking this in the dead of winter where it has been near zero for almost a month straight.  I am usually dragging and very tired and worn during this period.  I have been taking this along with a few supplements and I am doing remarkably well.THE BOTTOM LINEThis supplement seems to be supportive through a very difficult cold and dry winter.  I am usually tired, but taking this, I am not.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  This seems to be working for me.  I am not sure why there is no flavor or color, but it is helping somewhat so I will finish the bottle.
923. I was very interested to try this supplement as I like to take most of what is in the pills for immunity especially during the stressful winter months.  I did not realize that a bottle only lasts 10 days if taken as directed.SIZEThe pill size is standard and not hard to swallow.ODORThe odor of the pills is not excessive or intense.DIGESTIVE ISSUESI had no issues with burping, upset stomach, or other digestive problems when taking this.HOW I TOOK THISI took this as two capsules a day when I was feeling a bit under the weather.DID IT HELP?I did see that it helped me just by taking 2 capsules in a day.HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN?I was shocked when I read the instructions to take SIX capsules a day which amounts to this bottle only lasting 10 days.  That means at $20 a bottle (at the time of this review) that you would be paying $60 a month to take this supplement.  I am not sure it is worth that.COUNTRY OF ORIGIN?This says on the bottle that it is manufactured FOR a place in FL and FORMULATED in the US, but it does not say where it is actually made that I can find on the bottle.THE BOTTOM LINEAlthough this helped me some at a lesser dose than recommended, if taken as it says, it is pretty expensive.  I am not sure it is worth it to get 3 bottles a month.MY RATINGTHREE STARS.  Although it does work, it is a bit high priced and the bottle contains so little compared to monthly recommendations, I can not rate this higher than 3 stars.
924. I am always on the lookout for some good mangesium powders.  I use them at night before I go to sleep.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a glass jar and is well packed.FULL?The jar in the photo was taken after I only took two scoops of product.  The fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is.  It really should be a bit fuller than it was.EASY TO TAKE?This is not difficult to take.  It is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink it.FLAVOR?I did not find the flavor offensive.  Some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag.  This one was not like that for me at all.  It is actually pleasant to take uncluttered with sweetners.DOES IT HELPThis is really helpful to relax me at night.THE BOTTOM LINEThis powder is pleasant to take.  It is not cluttered with stevia or other additives.MY RATINGFIVE STARS. I am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added.  I only wish it was a little fuller.
925. I have been taking Carnitine capsules to help with Fibro pain.  Let's see how these worked.HOW THESE COMEThese come in an orange plastic bottle with an orange childproof cap.  The pills inside are pressed white powder.ARE THEY HARD TO SWALLOW?These tablets are a bit on the long side, but they are not too big to swallow, if you are sure to have a lot of water in your mouth.ANY BAD REACTIONS?I have not had any burping, or bad digestive reactions to these.DO THEY HELP?I find that taking these does help with fibro pain and energy about as well as the powder in gel caps that I normally take.  They do help take a bit of the edge off of the pain.THE BOTTOM LINEThese tablets are not the same as the powder in capsules I usually take but they seem to work as well to help with fibro pain and energy levels.  The orange bottle is great to help me find it quickly.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I am glad that I got these.  I was not sure when I first saw them, but after taking them, I think they work pretty well.
926. I have had some serious stress this past year (in addition to everything else we all have experienced).  It has taken a toll on my body.  I decided to start working out slowly to regain muscle mass and strength again.  I figured that this would help avoid some of the pain involved.JARThe jar is a decent size.  It is not oversized like so many of them.  It is filled up completely and comes with a scoop.DOSAGEI scoop is recommended daily first thing in the morning and then post workout if you work out that day.  The scoop looks to be about a teaspoon.FLAVORThere is no flavor at all to this.  Stirring it in water does not add anything in flavor to the water in my experience.DOES IT MIX IN WELL?This mixes in very well.  I did not get any problems with lumping or anything left undissolved in the glass.DOES IT HELP?I have not experienced extreme pain while taking this.  I have not had any remarkable results, however either.  Usually I would be in a lot of pain when working out, but this seems to take the edge off.  I am not a body builder, however, so my progress is slow on purpose more for rehab type of muscle building.DIGESTIVE ISSUES?I have had no issues while taking this so far.THE BOTTOM LINEThis is easy to take, has not flavor, seems to help take the edge off and comes in a decently small jar.MY RATINGFIVE STARS. I give it five stars because it seems to help some, is flavorless as stated, and it does not have any additives either.  It is a bit pricey, but then again, you are not paying for fillers either.
927. I love fresh wheatgrass juice.  Sometimes, however, I can not get the wheatgrass so I am limited to what I can find that is available like this.  Let's take a look.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This is a WHEATGRASS JUICE powder.  That is important because you are not getting all of the fiber like wheatgrass powder has which tastes awful.  It is a bright green and needs to be kept sealed in the foil bag it came in.HOW TO USE IT?I have found the best way to use wheatgrass is alone.  In absolute dire necessity fresh apple juice will go with it, but anything else tends to give an upset stomach.  I put a tsp of powder in a small glass of water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, blend it up and drink it.HOW DOES IT TASTE?As much as I prefer fresh wheatgrass juice, this is a decent substitute.  I did not find it repulsive or difficult to drink and it is a pretty green color too.  Some might find the flavor a bit over whelming, but I like it.DOES IT HELP?Believe it or not, it does help some.  Not as much as fresh juice, but it still does perk me up a bit.OTHER USE?I use a tiny bit of juice in our cat's homemade food on the winter time.  That way she is getting some greens but not in an overwhelming amount.  She loves it.THE BOTTOM LINEThis is a great way to get wheatgrass juice if you don't have any way to get fresh.  It should be kept sealed and consumed regularly until gone and kept in the refrigerator once opened to keep it fresher.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I am glad to have this and am surprised at how good it is compared to others I have had which I did not like.  I would buy it again.
928. I have always had sensitive teeth since I was a kid.  Finding toothpaste that is good for sensitive teeth, tastes good, and cleans well is not always easy.  This time, I think I found a winner!WHAT IS THIS TOOTHPASTE LIKE?This toothpaste is not a white paste more of a paste gel.  It has a really nice mojito flavor that is not sweet but still tastes good at the same time.  There is a flip top on it and the tube is plastic.HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?I have used it for half the tube now and it seems to help with sensitive teeth.  I also feel that it cleans the teeth well too.THE BOTTOM LINEI like this toothpastegel.  It tastes good, is unusual, but seems to work well for my sensitive teeth.MY RATINGFIVE STARS so far.  This is a nice product.  I would probably buy again if it continues to perform well over time.  I have two more tubes to go through.  I will update if anything changes.
929. It has been a tough winter.  We have barely seen the sun for weeks at a time.  That has a tendency to make a person cranky and feeling more tired than normal.  I have been trying to get more fresh, raw, and green into my body to help counteract this winter problem.  Let's take a look at this..WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This is a pretty large foil sealed bag of barley juice powder.  Notice it says JUICE.  That is essential when you are taking barely green.  Some people think that buying ground up barlely greens is just as good- it isn't.  This is very bright green and smells VERY fresh.HOW DO I USE THIS?I do not put this into things, but I prefer to get some refrigerator cold water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, and put a teaspoon of this powder in.  I run it for one cycle which is barely a minute, and then I have the most luscious fresh green drink you can get without fresh greens.  There is a lovely layer of foam on it and it tastes heavenly.DOES IT REALLY TASTE THAT GOOD?I must preface this by saying that I have had varieties of green powders, fresh green drinks including fresh wheatgrass and kale smoothies.  I know what fresh juice from many greens tastes like as I have made them from time to time.  This powder is one of the best I have had since the days when I used to take Green Magma from Japan, which was one of the original barley juice powders.HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO WHEATGRASS?This has a sweetness that is not quite as intense as wheatgrass juice is.  It is easier to drink in my opinion than wheatgrass.DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE?I will say that using barley juice powder helps a lot to add energy to my day, helps me to sleep better and it does tend to detox.  I would recommend you start with a half teaspoon at first if you are not used to this kind of product.  Work up to a teaspoon.  It also does keep me regular and not feeling quite so wiped out in times of stress.DID I GET A DETOX REACTION?I eat really healthy, do I did not get a detox reaction, but I also made sure to start with half a teaspoon and work up to a teaspoon.  It is important to go slowly with this as it can be a bit much if you are not used to it.THE BOTTOM LINEThis has given me energy, a more positive outlook, helped me feel supplemented, and definitely is helping me through winter very well compared to not having it  This tastes fresh and makes a wonderful drink.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I will be buying this again.  I stopped getting barley juice powder because I just could not find a really good quality one.. until now.  (grins).
930. I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water, but not too long ago, I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two, then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet, just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener, and the dropper has measuring lines on it.HOW TO USE THIS?I was so run down when I got thinking about it, I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having "the runs".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.By the end of the morning, I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.THE BOTTOM LINEThis is not hard to take, has just a bit of raspberry flavor, but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with "the runs"  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.MY RATINGFOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.  I also experienced good from it so far, so I am leaving it at FOUR STARS, but REALLY IT IS FOUR AND A HALF.
931. In my house we have a sock monster- who eats only one sock of every pair.  Then there is the mess monster.  He leaves a mess that no one knows anything about.  We also have another monster which has been frustrating me - the dustpan monster.  This monster not only makes dustpans disappear for months at a time, but when they come back, they have bites out of them or corners missing.  When I saw this, I was ecstatic.  Let's take a look.WHAT IS THIS SET LIKE?This set comes in a box of parts.  You have to put them together, but the instructions are easy to follow and loaded with pictures for those who are visual learners.  Once the set is assembled, you end up with a broom and a dustpan that clip together when not in use.HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?I have to say many brooms have left me wanting more.  This one, however, works just right.  It is not the BEST broom I have ever used, but it is definitely way better than many of them.  The cleaning feature of the dustpan is fantastic.  It really works.DOES THE DUSTPAN LEAVE DIRT ON THE FLOOR?If I press down the dustpan lightly, I find that 95% of the dirt goes in the first time.  I might have to press down with my foot for very fine dirt, but for the most part, it works well.DOES THE DUSTPAN LOCK?The dustpan locks into place, but it also is not hard to press down to use either.  There is no release button, it is pressure activated.IS THERE A HOLE TO HANG THIS FROM?No, there is not a hole to hang this from.  You will have to use a clip broom hanger style to put this on the wall.DOES THIS STAND UP?When this is put together and the dustpan is up, the counterbalance of the broom causes this to stand up pretty well.THE BOTTOM LINEI am very happy to have this set.  I love the dustpan which seems to work quite well and also has the great cleaning feature for the broom bristles.  It definitely does clean off pet fur and dust.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I LOVE THIS SET.  I have looked for a long time for a set like this- but the best part is that it stores well and stands up nicely too- It is compact.
932. When it comes to winter, sometimes we don't always have access to the vegetables that we want to have.  I love to have juice, but sometimes it just is not possible to get fresh vegetables at times.  Having this powder is a great alternative.WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE?This powder comes in a great packaging which seems to keep the powder dry very nicely.  It is cut open and then you can reseal it.  The powder is raw beets, but is freeze dried so you HAVE to keep this closed at all times, before and after you access it.HOW DO I USE IT?I either put this in my vegetable juice that I make fresh and blend it in my hand blender, or if desperate, I add it to cold water and drink it in my mini blender.  I also have used it to make a Keto version of red forest cake which is OUT OF THIS WORLD, by the way.  You just have to add more liquid to counteract the powder.THE BOTTOM LINEFor a great way to get beet juice into your diet when vegetables are not handy, this is an excellent alternative.  The powder is easy to use, tastes fresh and mixes well either in fresh juice or water, or you can use it in recipes too.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I LOVE how versatile it is and between the juice and red forest keto cake, I am most likely going to keep this in my cupboard when I run out- I will buy more.
933. I am used to using a variety of different spirulina powders.  Let's take a look at this one.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This comes in a bag which is pretty good at insulating against moisture and air, if you open it correctly.  Just cutting below the plastic seal allows for enough room to re-zip the bag shut.THE POWDERThe powder inside is very fresh smelling.  I have had spirulina which tastes overwhelming and others which tastes almost gaggy.  This one, however, is not unpleasant like some I have had.SCOOPThis comes with a small scoop inside to measure for smoothies.TASTEI am not minding this one.  The last spirulina powder I had was a bit overwhelming for me.  This one does not take over the smoothies in the same way.  It is earthy in flavor but not repulsive.THE BOTTOM LINEFor a good raw source of spirulina for shakes, smoothies, baking, or supplementation this seems to be a bit nicer than some.  It does not taste bad and it comes with a measure scoop.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  One of my favorite spirulina powders so far that I have tried.  It is very fresh smelling.
934. I try to make a regular habit of having wheatgrass juice on a regular basis, but sometimes when I can not get fresh wheatgrass, it is nice to have alternatives.  Let's see how this measures up.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This wheatgrass powder is freeze dried.  It comes in a re-sealable bag which has a measuring cup inside.  It is a nice green color and smells nice, not as awful as some wheatgrass that I have used in the past in powder form.HOW DO I USE THIS?I have a little cordless blender which is a handheld one for one serving.  I put a cup of cold water in my blender and a scoop full of powder in with it.  I blend one or two cycles to make sure the lumps are gone and then I drink it.FLAVOR?This is not as good as fresh wheatgrass juice, but it is helpful to get fresh green juice into my diet.  It is not like dried grass like some other wheatgrass powders I have used which don't taste too great.  This one tastes a bit greener, if that makes sense.HOW SOON TO USE IT UP?Because this is freeze dried, I opt to put it into a glass jar with oxygen absorbers to seal it when not in use.  Freeze dried powder is important to either use up quickly (like a month or two) or seal it up as I have explained.THE BOTTOM LINEFor a good substitute for fresh wheatgrass if you have not got that option, this powder is handy.  I find it helpful to use in my personal cordless blender to boost energy and get green juice into my diet when fresh is not available.MY RATINGFive stars.  One of the better wheatgrass powders I have tried over the years.  I would buy it again.
935. When it comes to stress, I think everyone is looking for a way to try to make those stressful times easier to deal with.  Ashwagandha has been a good way for many people to help deal with stress.  Let's see how this supplement has helped with that.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This powder comes in a resealable container with a measure scoop.  The powder is raw powdered herb.  The package says that this is often used for managing stress and supporting virility.  Let's see how this performed.HOW DID WE USE THIS?I put this in my smoothie a few times a week when I make them in the morning.  I have to say that I did see an increased ability to handle stress and also it did seem to boost virility too.IS IT EFFECTIVE?So far I am seeing a definite improvement in both things as laid out on the package.TASTESMELL?The smell and taste are not bad at all.  The taste is slightly bitter but not bad at all.  I find that it does not ruin smoothie flavor or leave awful aftertaste.THE BOTTOM LINEFor a well packaged powder that comes with a scoop, is great to add to sauces, food, smoothies, etc, this product seems to do what is says.MY RATINGFive stars.  I would definitely buy this again.  I like having it handy.  I plan to get my husband to start taking it daily too.  I will try it out in capsules too, but remember to drink plenty of water if you try that.
936. I am always looking for new natural supplements to put in my green smoothies.  We tend to eat more healthy around my house, so this looked really intriguing to me.  Let's see how it performed..WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE?This powder is green and comes in a foil re-sealed package.  It also comes with a little scoop to measure with.ODOR?This has very little odor.TASTE?This does taste like gooseberries without the severe tart twist that our bushes of gooseberries have.HOW DOES IT PERFORM IN SMOOTHIES?I find that using a scoop in a Vitamix sized smoothie is not enough to alter the taste so much that people won't drink it.  This powder ads a bit of a twist to the smoothie that I find refreshing.  It is not that bad and if I dip my finger in the powder and eat it, it is almost a buttery slightly tart feeling.ANY REACTIONS?We have had no bad reactions to this.  As for vitamin C, in the winter, I love having this available to put in smoothies as Vitamin C tends to be REALLY sour in nature.  This is far nicer to have.  Keep in mind it is only a tiny bit of Vitamin C and not therapeutic amounts.  This is not for battling sickness.THE BOTTOM LINEFor a nice natural additive to smoothies or other foods that increase nutritional content but don't overwhelm taste, this is a nice powder.  I have enjoyed using it for quite a few weeks now.MY RATINGI am giving this four stars.  It is pleasant tasting and not overwhelming and I like including it in smoothies.
937. Sometimes you get a pair of shoes that just is not comfortable.  The base of the shoe where the ball of the foot is, can be too thin and it can be hard on the feet.  These pads do seem to help, but let's take a closer look.WHAT ARE THESE PADS LIKE?These pads are for the ball of the foot.  They have a place for the area under the toes so you know where to put them.  The backing is a type which will hold into place pretty well.  It can be washed and reused.  The cushion has some flock on it which keeps it soft instead of overly rubbery.HOW DO THESE PERFORM?So far, I have a pair on one of my shoes.  The pad did make the shoe slightly tighter, but that pair had the room.  If the shoes are really fitted, they could make it too tight.  The pad did not seem to slide around that much and so far they have been good. If I am not careful, however, they will slide.FUTURE UPDATES?I will continue to test them in other shoes, however and update my review if I have anything to add.THE BOTTOM LINEFor reusable pads for the ball of the foot in some shoes that just are too hard, these are nice.  They will make the shoes tighter, so you need to have room for them.MY RATINGSo far four stars. They stay pretty well in place, but can shift a bit if you are not careful.
938. It worked for me while cutting down hedges! Has a pleasant smell and is very creamy. I love it!
939. I ordered the 'Dental Duty Teeth Whitening Kit With 14 Non-Slip Whitestrips & Whitening Accelerator Light' for review.  I have had the opportunity to review several other whitening kits recently and this one by far has given my wife the best results.  She has completed six 20-minute sessions and already has had significant results.  Her additional thoughts:• Compared to whitening pens or other trays, these are much easier to use.  You simply open the strips, place the larger strip on your top teeth and the smaller strip on your bottom teeth.  Be sure to get all the way down to your gums and press the strip to adhere closely to your teeth.  Then insert the light into the mouth tray and turn it on.• The light has an automatic shut off at 10 minutes.  Just turn it back on once or twice dependent on the time you want to continue whitening.  I would not recommend nor does the instructions recommend any longer than a half hour.• You do need to open the battery compartment to remove the paper between the two batteries to use it.• The photos show her before pic along with after the first use and then after 6 uses.  The pictures were taken in the same spot in the house at the same time of day without a flash.• Because these are strips versus a gel, you do not have anything draining into your mouth while you are whitening.  Once you turn off the light and remove the tray there is some saliva mixed with white foam.  She did not gag as much as with the gels.• It may be too early to tell but, at this point this product has not caused any additional sensitivity to her teeth.• This kit is less expensive then many other less comparable whitening kits.Overall, my wife is happy with the results she has seen already.  She is looking forward to finishing a complete week. Once she does I will update my review with new after pictures.
940. I had the opportunity to review the Sytmhoe Sleep Mask for Men Women.  My wife travels to Alaska for work and she can have a difficult time sleeping during the summer when it does not get dark.  Plus, purple is her favorite color.  She took them recently on a trip and these were her thoughts:• The mask will block out the light if you get it adjusted on your face correctly.  However, when I had full coverage, the elastic band was folded uncomfortably behind my ears.  When I would move it for better comfort, the light would shine through.• They are well padded and comfortable on the face.• The stitching is well done.  The adjustable band is reinforced to keep it secured and lessen the change of it tearing off.• It is contoured so it does not sit flat on her eyes.  She does not wake up with mangled eyelashes.• The elastic band has Velcro to adjust its length for a better fit.Overall, this is a well-made sleep mask for the price.  My wife will use it when she needs to, but not on a regular basis at night of how the band fits too close to her ear.
941. I ordered this set of Pill Case - 2 Pack Portable Travel Medicine and Vitamins Organizers. for review as my wife travels for work.  They are very well made.  The purple and pink are very pretty light colors.  It is compact enough to throw into her carry on bag or purse.  The main downfall to this case is that because it is compact 4 of the slots are 12 slots and don't always hold a full days supplements.  The compartments each have their own lids, which snap down tightly.  This is a plus in my book, because some of the compact pill carriers we have used,  are at times segmented but only have one snap lid over all the compartments.  Making it difficult to just get one day's dose from them.  My wife will have to take both of these when she travels in order to hold both her night and morning medications and supplements.  Overall, well made, just a little too compact for my wife.  Which may not be a bad thing for others.
942. I'm giving this product three stars, primarily due to the fact it is a knee scooter. And the pad where you put your knee is not very much padding at all in fact it's a willful attempted being a good pad and the covering that covers that is even worse. With very little use my wife having had foot surgery, the pad felt inadequate to begin and degrades very rapidly, and the fake leather whatever the covering is on it is made of is like starting to crack and maybe as durable as a wet paper towel maybe.That's the bad stuff now the good stuff is in terms of mobility and functionality this thing offers quick release adjustment on the handlebars which is far far superior to most of the other brands which you have to take the pin all the way out unscrew it all the way take it all the way out adjust the handlebars and then you have to store it somewhere not very Mobile in my opinion so this one's light years ahead of all of those.  Overall I have to say compared to what else is on the market this thing is a pretty good value for the money but it still leaves a lot to be desired. Having said that it is the one that we finally purchased. Similar to how we vote in the United States, sadly we had to choose between the better piece of garbage.
943. Yeah it works. Not much to it, I enjoy it; and it’s actually kind of soothing.Good price, easy to clean. You get 2
944. I have allergies to long haired dogs and evergreens. This is a natural allergy medicine that works wonders. I have been dog sitting at my friends house who has a long haired dog and Nettle has made it possible to still breathe. Thank you Nature’s Way!
945. Nature's Benadryl with no side effects! Gotta love it! It just works
946. Used it for less than two months and it died!DO NOT BUY!!!
947. I did not like the curler, and had difficulty with it, however the Customer Service of the company was spectacular.  I believe more people have  had good success with it and if it looks appealing try it.
948. This is an edited review that includes my most recent experiences with these really very good insoles.  My rating  remains the same.  It would be 5 stars with increased forefoot cushioning.1.  First a note about sizing.I wear size 10 extra wide sneakers.  I purchased a pair L - Women's 11-12.5 | Men's 10-11.5.  These were too long and too wide.  I cut them down to size.  In cutting them down to size, I had to assure that I cut them down to be no bigger than other insoles that I knew fit well in my shoes.2.  FunctionThe RooRuns insoles are functioning better than all other brands of arch support insoles I have used and continue to use. Every other insole I've used, besides RooRuns Plantar Fasciitis Arch Support Insoles, has the apex of the arch support hitting the forward part of my heal bone.  I've seen an image from an insole manufacturer indicating that that is by design.  I believe I would be much more comfortable if the apex were about a quarter inch further forward.  And, that's where the cut-down-to-size RooRuns insoles have the arch apex!I also bought a two pairs of  size M - Women's 9-10.5 | Men's 8-9.5.  These fit my shoes without need for cutting for size.  The arch apex of the size M insoles are significantly more forward of all the non-RooRuns insoles , but just short of the position of the RooRuns size L insoles.  I've done three 4+ mile runs and several long walks with RooRuns Plantar Fasciitis Arch Support Insoles, with the size M and the size L insoles, and my feet felt much much more comfortable than when I've used insoles from other manufacturers.  And, so have my knees.  The size L insoles are slightly more comfortable than the size M insoles.All the RooRuns Plantar Fasciitis Arch Support Insoles could use more cushioning for the forefoot.  Thus, my rating is below 5 stars.
949. I've been using probiotics for some time, they definitely offer benefits to digestion. These gummies are a tasty and effective way to improve your gut health. 5 billion cfus. Recommended.
950. Trying to find a way to incorporate apple cider vinegar into our diets, what could be easier than gummies? They taste good and they're effective.
951. Solid construction and efficient. This ear and nose trimmer does a nice job of trimming without any pulling or risk of injury. It's not terribly loud, either. Recommended.
952. Nice bath brush has brush and scrungie thing. Sturdy plastic handle makes it fully waterproof and easy to reach where it needs to.
953. All natural formula. Each "serving" contains 40 billion cfu (a serving is 2 capsules) - they promise a minimum potency of 20 billion could by the expiration date. Theres 60 capsules in the bottle. The probiotics strains listed (there are 4 of them) seem to be similar to others with names like bifidobacterium andclactobacillus, etc. The difference in this product being the "Macktrek bi-pass technology", which appears to refer to the specific blend and how it survives into your system. The capsules are easy to swallow gel caps and they're defined as "shelf stable", the bottle i got has an expiration date approximately 5 months from when I received them.
954. CoQ10 is an anti-oxident that's produced by your body, but that decrease as we age. Taking suppliments is supposed to help maintain heart health as well as blood pressure, among other things. This formula touts itself as being water dissolvable and therefore has 3 times the absorption, so the 100 mg gel caps should be more effective than comparable brands. So far, it appears to be exactly as described, though sometimes it's difficult to tell with suppliments such as these. They're considered safe and have health benefits beyond even the heart health (which is enough).
955. This powder is a natural herb that touts benefits to your liver, including detoxification. In addition, it's supposed to contain lots of antioxidants, and antiinflamatort agents. It's a fine brown powder with a very slight earthy taste. I tried mixing it with some iced tea and ended up with lots of clumps... I think a better way to use this might be to sprinkle it on a salad, or if you were actually blending a drink like a smoothie.
956. Well we had to return it because it was horribly painful to place my shin on and then in pain, very hard to operate. A walker is easier!
957. Didn't seem to do anything for me.
958. Hate that I assumed by the reviews these would actually be a quality product... But the lint left after wiping and the weak quality of the Parent's choice line has left me disappointed. Equate, Pampers and Huggies are a far better value.
959. I found that this traction device is of the utmost highest quality than all the rest. Also if you have any questions you can contact the company and they will assist you.  My surgery liked it so good the he was going to recommend it to his other patients.  It is easy to adjust up and down and very comfortable as much as traction can be. I have tried several others and this is by far the best for a soft traction device.
960. Cheap flimsy plastic. I threw them away.
961. This was fine except for two things:1.  It's thicker than I thought.  It would not fit in the side pocket of my purse.2.  The one I received, the top open too easily.  Just a baby bump against the closure and out popped all of my pills.So I returned this item.
962. Smells nice but total ripoff $7.99 for a 2.5oz....when you can get a 7oz bottle for a dollar more. My fault should've read teh description. PLUS the picture with all the bottles is misleading, you would think you were getting 6-7 mini cans for $7.99.. But again my fault..
963. I like this product but when these arrived all of them sprayed out of the side of the nozzle rather than where it’s meant to spray out of. I didn’t realize until it was too late that it was spraying into my automatic sprayer and both of them broke because of it.Amazon was great about it and gave me my money back, though.
964. Exactly as described. Both table cloths were thin plastic but they held up just fine throughout the party. Worked out great!
965. Along with an autoimmune diet this probiotic is really helping me treatreverse my autoimmune disease.
966. This works better than the more expensive drops, I don't know why it just does...I only add these drops per serving of whatever I am eatdrinking right then.For myself, there is a certain number of drops per cup in coffee in a serving of that it will &#34;cancel&#34; out the caffeine, I don't go over 3 drops per 32 oz cup coffee in morning coffee. I can not taste these drops in anything-hot beverages, silk milk, ice tea (grnblk), fruit juices, waters, soups, stews- it &#34;smooths out&#34; alka seltzer plus, soda pop and mixed drinksliquor; there is still a good amount of the fizz...just removes the harshness- the &#34;edge.&#34; I keep this squeeze bottle on my kitchen counter.There is much info that comes with this purchase on the box, etc.
967. These pads work well for general face cleaning.  They are a bit too harsh for my eyes.
968. It's ok.  If you are a senior and have Medicare, you can get a script and go and get it done by a professional therapist.
969. Not for me. Stomach upset.
970. This products works as the most effective pre-soaking stain removal for me.  I have tried many and this wins hands down
971. Great product for the price. Works great.
972. i feel like this is the perfect contour pillow, because it lowers your heads and provide perfect support to your neck. i love the design of it, i wake up feeling alot more active while using this pillow. The only bad thing about this pillow is, it has a very strong chemical smell, it wont go away for a good 24 hours. i would highly recommend if you order this particular pillow please dont sleep on the night it arrive, let it air out for at least 2 days.Hope this helps :)
973. Its not bad...I needed something for my shoulders and back when my husband wasn't home to rub them :)I get pain in my upper back and shoulders and this does seem to help a little bit.
974. Lots of neck pain is eased with this friend.
975. exactly what I needed and the week box was an added bonus!  Thanks
976. My favorite artificial sweetener since I found it in Hong Kong 35 years ago. Convenient and easy and 1200 tablets seem to last forever. Although it contains saccharin, no nasty bitter aftertaste.
977. These files are the best for keeping your nails smooth and well groomed.  These I bought as a gift for my sister. Be careful not to drop them on a hard surface--glass breaks!
978. Delicious and nutritious. These help me feel better and taste fantastic. Pineapple flavor. But not overpowering.
979. My washing machine is sparkling clean now! Fantastic product!
980. These are our family favorite for bathroom wipes. Happy with the 12 pack we got.
981. Fast results that are clear. No dye run issues.
982. My husband bought me a pair of these I had saved to our list. As some other reviewers have said, they fit phenomenally. I have small ears and have a difficult time finding earplugs or earbuds that fit. Usually they will pop out or hurt my ears. These for just right and I can wear them for hours without any problems. I liked mine so much I ordered these for my mom. She has the same issues with earplugs and earbuds, but adores these. Thanks so much!
983. I like the idea that it's natural, I'm able to stave off hunger with only 3 per day!! And I'm eating healthier!
984. After one month, I started to feel more energized and better appetite as well.
985. This works very well.
986. I like this product. Works well.
987. Great product.
988. Very good product.
989. This is a repeat purchase, It seems to work well for me.
990. Helps with my wife reaching the shower head.
991. It keeps me fresh and clean no matter where I decide to go
992. I use this and nonstick pads instead of Band-Aids. I have bad reactions to the adhesives on Band-Aids and this tape saves me everytime. Easy to cut the shape you need.
993. The toe straighteners are thickly padded and large for my feet anyway. I had to trim them because they stick out beyond my toes and I cannot get my socks on. You definitely have to have wide shoes to wear these. Not sure I would purchase them again.
994. Does the Job.
995. Great, soft brush! My skin is very sensitive, I can't use abrasive soaps and brushes. This brush is just perfect, and it creates a really nice lather, too! I haven't had it long, but it seems to be sturdy and hopefully it will be long lasting.
996. spring cleaning, major cleaning, this will hold up to 2 of the of other one. Personally a better deal. Still not sure it will handle the mold too well but there are cleaners for that lol I'm impressed I've given some to neighbors
997. I apologize for not saying so sooner.. My fibromyalgia has good days and bad. It is also extremely hot down here so I try not to be on Amazon too long because I spent too much money lol But truly it is a beautifully crafted piece. I use t for head piece during full moon rites but I do love it. I plan to take a peek around your shop soon. TY
998. Really great size. Because there are 4 sections,  even if you take LOTS caps, there is so much room
999. People always comment on how good it smells.
1000. I've heard a lot about the benefits of apple cider vinegar so I decided to give these a try. They taste good and are very easy to chew. I haven't noticed any ill effects from taking them, and they do seem to help suppress appetite (not majorly so, but less cravings). However, these gummies are very tacky to the touch and very difficult to get out of the bottle as they stick together and are very soft. I've tried hitting it against something to try to shake them out, but that doesn't work very well. Digging them out can present a challenge since they're so soft.
