1. I am always losing my readers or &#34;cheaters&#34; and if I am not losing them, I am scratching them! It makes sense for me to have more than one pair in one place since I don't like wearing bifocals and would rather not pay the expense of several pairs of prescription glasses or the cost of bifocals. Readers are my preference. This 3 pack offers value and style as each pair you get is a different color. I like that option! They come in many strengths obviously, I have one of the lower ones at 1.25+ but they offer much stronger ones as well. This way, I can have a pair on my end table in the livingroom, one in the car for when I go shopping and one in my craft and sewing room for when I work on projects. I am never without eyes now!! The quality seems good and they have spring loaded hinges. One of the best parts that I personally like is that they have plastic, already built in nose pads that are part of the glasses. I used to have readers that had the nose pads that were separate and attached with the teeny tiny screws. The screws would break off or come out and get lost and then the readers were virtually worthless. I like the molded kind much better - no screws and nothing to break. I am well pleased with this variety pack of readers! I received this product for freediscount in exchange for a fair and honest review.

2. I am a former nurse and I have a well stocked first aid kit in my house and car and am always prepared for most emergencies, but that being said, I have never had a tourniquet and when I saw this set, I thought it would be a good idea to add that to my already fairly comprehensive kit. The fact that there are two, is a plus becuz I can keep one at home and one in my car. These tourniquets are probably the easiest I have ever seen to use and can reliably be used on yourself if necessary. The bands are made of a strong, durable elastic and can be cinched very tight, which is what is needed if you ever need to use a tourniquet. The locking mechanism keeps it securely in place and with the pop of the tab - like releasing the tab of a dog collar, it can be released one handed. Hopefully I will never have need of using a tourniquet, but since I like to always be prepared for things in case, this is a good addition to my first aid kits. I think this is something that anyone who lives very rurally, travels or hikes or camps, would all benefit from having a tourniquet in their first aid kit and these are easy to use, come with a detailed instruction card including pictures and are small and stored easily.

3. The pill slots are to small. It will only fit one triple fish oil pill per slot. If your pills are average, it may work for you.
4. 2nd one I bought, the first was wider at the head.  This one seems a little harder on my head when brushing but it works
5. TASTE IS GREAT I MIX IT WITH ULTIMA REPLENISHER ELECTROYTE DRINK FOR WHEN I PLAY GOLF AND SWEAT ALOT.  KEEPS UP MY ENGERY.
6. These steamer bags are a great way to get your veggies in.  I had bought the Ziploc brand before for a lot more money but these are just as good quality and much less expensive
7. Exactly what I expected! Thanks!
8. Hardly rotates.
9. These socks are great. The fabric is soft, smooth, lovely; feels really nice next to my skin. I love how colorful & fun these compression socks are because all I've found up until now were just drab tan, black or white stockings that looked hideous. Just because I have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities (feet, calves) doesn't mean I want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose. These are so cute, bright & colorful. The only downside is that I am wearing these due to leg swelling & when my calves are real swollen (which is often unfortunately), the design on some of these socks gets stretched out, causing you to lose the very thing that makes these so pretty. The design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost on some designs & not so colorful. This hasn't happened on all the socks I've purchased from this maker, (I have about 6 pairs), but definitely on some. If you're on the thin side or don't experience much swelling, this probably won't be a problem at all. A solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes, like small & large.

11. It comes on, it is quiet, and it is tiny. It has a nice look, if not a little sci-fi. Do these things really work? No idea. But we hope they do.
12. The 1 lb package was delivered in odd packaging, just a plain brown bag, not what is shown in the picture.  NONE of the sticks ever released the bubbles that indicate the filtering process.  I know this from previous experience with the same product from another vendor.  The first set of charcoal had bubbles for weeks, and once the bubbles stopped, I would boil the sticks, and then the bubbles were back, that was the routine for more than six months.  Eventually, the sticks stopped producing bubbles, but that was ok; 6 months seemed fair, reasonable.  This set is another story; let's see, odd packaging, no bubbles, re-boil and still no bubbles, different sticks from same brown bag and still no bubbles.  Hmmmmmmm
13. Great service, product was as expected.
14. LOTS of paper. I filled over 15 baskets for work. Will buy again next season.
15. Great purchase.
16. NOt fancy but they do the trick.  The foam pad isn't porous so you don't have to worry about it soaking up your lotion.  I don't have any issues reaching with it, but I can see how some people might.  Overall I'm happy with these.
17. Really love these! clear lenses. nice style and priced well. Use them for quilting, reading, computer. great for all these uses and more!
18. Excellent product and your service too!
19. This would be adorable for a baby's room.  My living room, not so much.  Going to save it foe the next baby shower.
20. This product gets everything clean. It's the best.
21. Great for getting rid of ants.
22. Updated:At first I really liked these sleep masks. I had to make a small adjustment, but they seemed to work well so I gave them four stars. Well, now that I have used it for a while, the red sleep mask leaves black marks from the strap all over my sheets. The black dye will not wash all the way out, so I have ruined a nice set of sheets. I don't know if this is the case with all the masks from this company or just mine. So beware when you purchase.These sleep masks are pretty good, especially for the price. You get two masks, two sets of foam ear plugs (which I don't use), and a carrying case. I really like that these are contoured over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyelid. The only reason they didn't get five stars is the nosepiece. I found it to be a little too wide. I had to perform minor surgery and cut out a small v-shaped piece of material from the nosepiece in order to make the mask block out more light from the bottom and take pressure off the bridge of my nose. Now they work great, but I probably decreased the lifespan of the masks. But for the price, I don't think that will be problem Time will tell.
23. Needed to replace the arm rest on the scooter....this was a perfect match and fit.
24. Didn't keep the smell at bay for long.
25. really like this towel, great service
26. I'm allergic to it. The smell irritates me.
27. I love this mustard and it is so good, all of them.  They are well worth the money and you won't be disappointed until the jar is gone and then you will be soooo sad.
28. One ear keeps popping off easily: they don’t seem to stay on snuggly enough but are soft for the ears and comfortable
29. Love this for my class room
30. I got these for my son’s tenth birthday. He loved them. They looked really nice hanging up and held up great for the whole day.
31. I bought this for a Christmas gift to give to my mom. She loves things like this. I didn't actually read the description on it before purchasing, so I was shocked at the size of it when I took it out of the box. I was expecting a smaller item, but I'm glad it is bigger than I expected because I think she will like it a lot more.
32. Came in my monthly box. Works as intended. Box wasn't damaged. Seals were intact.
33. Sometimes you just need a little play, and this works well for the shower or for individual play and lovers.
34. We do not use anything else. Nothing compares. Love it, just a bit more expensive but worth it. Hair doesn't get sticky. Goes on light.  I do wish there was no odor. Daughter freaks out about breathing it in. Tell her it is good stuff but she doesn't like it, so sometimes I am chasing that head around.
35. Excellent tool and doesn't hurt my nose!
36. Nice little unit. It’s quiet enough that my cats don’t freak when they see it. I’ve even been able to use it on my 16 year old cat’s stomach and everything scares him.
37. I was not expecting the large size of this. This will not fit most rolling papers only extra long ones. I ended up purchasing a smaller (1.25) size that fits most papers. The product was great quality just not what I was looking for. Make sure you are paying attention to the size. It was delivered quickly and as listed.
38. Any Lions fan will love these ziplocs. A little pricey, but living in Florida we can't get ANY of our team gear here so of course I'm willing to spend a bit.
39. This package contains a nice variety of dental items for dogs.
40. I purchased this case to protect my oils for an upcoming move overseas. I love the print that I chose and the extras that came with it. It seems to be a pretty sturdy case. Holds all of my oils perfectly. The 5mL bottles are a tad bit loose in the slots but that’s not a problem right now. The 15mL bottles fit very snug which is perfect. I will try to remember to update after my flight to let you guys know whether the case protected the oils or not.
41. Pricey but pretty. Work nicely
42. What a back saver .
43. The vitamin D tablet that I was taking was like a horse pill. It was huge and not coated. Very hard to get down. This tiny gel type pill is a wonder! It is so small and coated. Very easy to swallow. No after taste.These I look forward to taking!
44. This sleep mask came in such a nice package. It was kind of like getting a gift. It fits snug enough to stay on but loose enough not to feel confined. It blocks the light out so I can get a good nap or sleep no matter if it's day or night. I hardly can tell that I'm wearing a sleep mask at all.
45. First off I really liked the packaging. Inside the box were two different boxes of the bandages. They are the fabric type bandages. They were enclosed in very sealed packages themselves and were easy to open. The bandages were stretchy so you can form around what you need to cover. The fabric of the bandage was strong. I really liked these bandages and they are well worth the $.
46. These do what they say they do. They are very easy to swallow. I have had no problems with them.
47. I love that this has a sturdy stand and wheels. They roll very easy. The drying power is very good. It dries up rather than down which I think dries the hair faster. It was easy to assemble. Very professional type dryer.
48. After using the sponge for a couple weeks I can honestly say it's one of those things that I didn't know I needed it's really gentle on my skin and I love using it with my simple cleaner. I was a little thrown off by the way It arrives it waschard textured like a rock but after running it under water it became very soft and luxurious feeling
49. Not thrilled with this product. I wanted it to work, but it did not stretch my shoes at all.
50. Fresh, not overly perfumed scent.  This worked very well on our recent trip.  Will definitely restock for the next one and keep as a staple when traveling.  Only wish I could find refills for the nice container, rather than buying the whole thing again.
51. It doesn’t not blink in any way that is described in the listing. Absolute waste of money.
52. I was disappointed cause they are really too large for kids
53. Came cracked and late. Returned. Nice size though.
54. Good for the cost
55. Good quality
56. These do well curling my lashes on just one try. I hold them down for about 5 seconds. I think the difference is that the lash pad is made of a silicone material. I've never been a huge fan of curling my lashes. In the past it seems like it has done more damage than it's worth. I decided to invest in a more expensive curler in hopes that I would get better results. I have been happy with this eye lash curler. Not only does it do the curl well and on one try, but it is also comfortable. I don't feel like I am yanking my lashes out. I am able to get pretty close to the lash line and have not pulled any lashes out.  Overall, I like this product enough that I use it almost every day now.  Discounted sample tested for evaluation and review purposes.
57. one for the car. one for the backpack, and one for the bicycle! super cute too.
58. I bought this thru their site, but i know everyone goes to amazon for reviews. I took it for a month with no difference whatsoever! If anything it just made my hair feel greasy.In addition to that the company that makes it is the rudest Ive ever experienced ! (The company not this seller just to be clear)
59. They do a great job. I just wish they lasted longer.
60. These are great for getting the callouses off my heels!
61. I get this every year to keep everyone’s immune system up
62. I got two packages of these for travel, I was not real fond of the strong watermelon flavor.  It was way too sweet for me, so I ended up sending back one of the packages. They do work well for sleep, but if you don't like watermelon or sweet, I don't recommend.
63. My husband said he was not impressed by this flavor and it took a lot to get a hint of the orange. He did say he got a hit of orange creamsicle taste but it too a great deal of the product to get that hint. Also this product is not part of prime and the shipping cost was more then the price I paid so not a great bargain unless you were to buy many more flavors. This is not the first Capella flavor he has tried and while they indeed taste like the descriptions it takes a great deal more product to achieve then other brands. Now this is in reference to using it to make homemade vape juice and I'm sure if using for food purposes the flavor would be must stronger. All in all, it's just ok, and will not be ordering again.
64. Adorable little bundles!  Smelled wonderful too!
65. Nice quality, thick, soft without perfume
66. Hemp is a wonderful weed that can be made into just about anything. This is a superior product.
67. Love them! The adult size doesn't really help someone who is 5'3. They were way to tall. After I adjusted them to the right setting they were just fine. Study and very well made!
68. My daughter has Potz Syndrome so we have to track her water intake. We have a water bottle that has a sensor for daily use. However there are times that the water bottle just isn't as handy. This is a great alternative to fill in those time. Its small and the band has great elasticity. Fits over all glasses we have used it on thus far. The light is just right. It flashes to signal the user hasn't taken a drink, however, it isn't so bright that the whole restaurant will look at you. I would recommend this, it has help us a lot.
69. Comes in handy
70. I bought these because the bristles were charcoal and the rest of the toothbrush is bamboo.  I liked that there was no plastic.  The feel of the toothbrush is different, but it works so well.  My teeth felt cleaner!  I loved it so much I bought another pack!
71. I drink camu camu in my juice or in my smoothies. I bought some camu camu as well for a family member. Even if a person did not want to use camu every day, it is a good product to have in the cupboard. When you start feeling like you are run down - take camu camu for a few days. If you feel as if you are on the verge of coming down with a bug, add camu to your diet. When everyone at the j.o.b. was getting ill, I sailed on through every time as healthy as can be. Although some people say that camu does taste a bit bitter, I found that varies with brands, Regardless, I simply mix it (with my bullet or blender not a spoon!!) with apple juice, or pine apple juice if I'm not adding it to one of my&#34;mean green&#34; smoothies. I've tried 3 different brands and I like Maju's.I did not find it sour tasting. This is an organic product which is high in vitamin C.
72. Really helps my allergies, will be ordering more.
73. Great product with fast delivery
74. Love it. So glad I made the purchase I use all the attachments and I am especially pleased with the face brush. The bag is a nice touch.
75. I consulted with my internist and endocrinologist before I started taking this. I was very happy that they thought adding this supplement to my daily regimen would be greatly beneficial to my health. This supplement is a well balanced mix of essential vitamins and minerals that helps with the quality of my health and immune system. I am in my mid thirties and I am noticing that the overall quality of my health and well being is just not the same anymore. To make things worse, I have several health conditions that I have been suffering from, for years now. I started taking this supplement together with other natural vitamins that complement its benefits. It is made from superior ingredients and in my opinion, it is well priced.

76. My husband and I are hooked on these Insoles! I use mine as a precautionary measure at the gym, because I always seem to end up having solearch issues when I'm working out (happens mostly on my heavy cardio days). I bought a second setpair for my husband, because he is on his feet for 8 to 10 hours a day at work and needs this Arch Support Shoe Insole to alleviate the pain he normally experiences on his feet. It has been working well for both of us and needless to say, I am beyond thrilled that I was given the opportunity to review it.

77. I used to have full blown type 2 diabetes before I started changing my diet and lifestyle and fish oil has been one of the supplements that I incorporated in my daily regimen. I have taken a lot of brands of fish oil supplements and the one from Gloreyfeel is one of my all time favorite brands. It has high concentrations of omega per pill and it doesn’t have that overpowering fishy taste when I take it.Fish Oil is beneficial to people who are suffering from various heart diseases, high cholesterol, depression, anxiety, AHDH, weakened immune system, cancer, diabetes, inflammation, arthritis, to name a few.

78. I've been battling Vitamin D deficiency ever since I can remember and this supplement has been helping me a lot. This deficiency greatly affects my blood sugar levels, so I make it a point to religiously take this supplement. I have been getting decent numbers when my doctor orders complete blood panel tests - which goes to show that this supplement is doing its job!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

79. My daughter has course curly hair and she tried this and it worked great it took about 10 min and it looks great. She loves this it is so easy and will do her hair more often.
80. My friend and I vacation together  a few days together every year, I have trouble sleeping because she snores really loud. The ear plugs were wonderful, I could barely hear her snoring, i could still hear, but it was a faraway sound. I was really pleased with them.
81. Very satisfied with the scooter. I have problems with my feet and stress fractures. I bought the scooter so I would have it if I needed it and not have to rent one.
82. Love this stuff!
83. Exactly as described- no complaints! A good deal- perfect transaction!
84. Perfect for the dessert bar. The right size !! They are thick and not cheesy looking !
85. Great for the price, the material is soft and feels high quality. It does let a tiny light to enter trough the nose part but it's ok for any comfy sleep.
86. I was told by my boss at a dry cleaners that this is the domestic version of the commercial stain remover he uses in his process. You cannot believe the results he gets! After running out of the bag he gave me, I tried this formulation. It takes considerably more, but is worth it. It removes stains of all types and whitens beautifully. Best results are achieved by using hot water and giving a soak. But it will also work in lower temps.Hint: Run an inch or two of water in your bathtub. Add some BIZ and detergent. Soak. Squeeze, don't wring, don't drain, and then wash in a normal wash. I do heavy stains overnight, then lesser ones in the same water. This removed blue shampoo from a white cotton shower curtain that was marked cold, hang to dry! That saved me the cost of replacing the curtain.
87. This is a dismal failure, in my book. The shape isn't quite right, so I am missing something that apparently others were impressed by. It has an angry buzz, as you'd expect from a vibrator, but that doesn't seem to translate into satisfying stimulation. Some texture on the plastic might help. Also, the body is poorly sealed. Around the insertible section it is properly seamed closed, but the rest of the body has a gap.My recommendation os you find another vibrator.
88. I tried this when I was on vacation in Australia and loved the way it stuck - stayed put on an injured foot like nothing ever has before.  It doesn't leave that sticky residue, either.
89. Skeptical buyer but went for it after watching You Tube videos on how incredibly clean this product transforms your mildewmoldydirty vinyl siding and decking to like new condition. We were amazed. Our UPS driver delivered an Amazon box to us and we showed him how clean this makes the vinyl siding. He couldn't believe it either. In fact, he took a snapshot of this product and repeatedly thanked us for showing him as he doesn't have the time to climb ladders to clean his house. We purchased this product's pump sprayer too; the sprayer reached the highest pitch (approx. 25') of our garage so we didn't need to climb a ladder to apply it either. Amazing product; will use every year for certain!
90. Great smell, great quality.
91. It didn’t really help keep my glasses up and wore off after a short while.  It may work for people with different shaped noses, I think glasses have a harder time staying on mine.
92. I love this sunblock, we used it for 4 hours atin the lake.  No sunburn on my 5 year old or I.  I usually use organic expensive sunscreens for him but I forgot them and this is all I had.  It worked great!
93. my only issue is there’s no child safe lid. It just spins right open. I have 2 young kids so I have to keep this in a really high spot. Just a warning for any other parents. Customer service was excellent however and I definitely recommend this company.
94. This product is AMAZING!  I have tried many, many creams, lotions, special socks, microplaners, and anything else that advertises they can get rid of your cracked heels.  Nothing has worked. Even at the nail salon I have never left satisfied with how my heels felt. I had resigned myself to the fact I was never going to have smooth feet again.  But this thing works!  I read reviews where people said it stops if you push down on it, well there is a reason for that. If you push too hard you can hurt yourself. It's a safety mechanism that makes sense. Just be patient and it will work.  I've used it three times since Christmas, even though my heels were still pretty smooth, I just like the way it feels.  If you have rough feet, you will be amazed at the snow shower you create using this.  Put down a towel or something to catch all the lovely dead skin that comes showering down.  Buy this!  You will love it.
95. Nice little key ring. It has several little plastic containers that you can use for many different things.I'm using it to carry with me oils for the sauna when going to the gym. It is small and you can easily carry it with you.
96. It seems to work
97. Use it a lot
98. They are great
99. perfect pill cutter for big heavy hills. Delivers a nice simple sharp even cut
100. Port City Pomade Beard Oil and Leave- In Conditioner comes in either 1 ounce or 2 ounces. I got the 2 ounce bottle. It comes with a dropper top. This is how you get the beard oil out. Drop 2-5 drops in your hands and then apply to the beard. Port City Beard Oil is certified organic with all natural ingredients. The bottle stands about 1.5&#34; wide and 4.75&#34; tall. Port City handmakes their products in a barber shop in the USA. The product is hypo- allergenic and Non- toxic.This oil has been so great for my husbands beard and also his skin. It leaves his beard soft, smooth and tamed. This oil enhances the health of the skin and beard and helps immediately and long term, the more he uses it, the less he needs it. The smell is compared to a woodsey smell and I disagree. I normally think of a pine smell for woodsey and this isn't. It has a nice unstrong smell... I like it and can handle it.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my full, unbiased and honest review. I test every product before reviewing.

101. I am very happy with my purchase of these hot socks. My feet get cold very easily in the air conditioning &  I'm not a happy camper with cold feet at all. I have used these during the day while on the computer  & just love using them at night going to bed. You just pop them in microwave, slip them on those cold toes &  feet. Oh my what a warm fuzzy feeling. I can't wait till winter, my feet will be very happy this year after playing in the snow. I like to apply  lavender or roman chamomile essential oils to my feet also with castor oil ,cover your feet with a plastic bag & then put these socks on. It does double duty for warm,soft & smooth feet & a better nights sleep. I received this product at a discount or for free for giving a review.
102. Like but don't love. Wiggles around too much and causes fatigue in sensitive areas. Use for no more than 4 hours a day.
103. I like them so much that I got some for my kids and signif other.  Found that I really only need one per day though.  Great product!
104. Vision is great with this tool.  Works well and  light is bright.
105. These are on point!
106. I got this for my best friend for Christmas as a &#34;gag&#34; gift, and she loved it! She uses it religiously. The light really helps to find those hidden stones in the crannies of your tonsils. The three different attachments really help as well.
107. I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS FISH OIL TASTES.  I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY GET IT TO TASTE THIS GREAT, I'M JUST GLAD THEY DO.
108. Um, I am sure for some people these are great. They are not useful to me because they don’t offer enough of a cushion to make a difference.
109. These are very cute and great for small gifts.
110. This works perfectly for keeping meds locked up when little ones are around. Very well made and sturdy protection.
111. I really like Magic Eraser and it has helped make products come clean when before there was no hope! Since this product came out I've tried the $1.00 imitations that worked but crumbled in the process. So I went back to the original. And I am not too happy. I used this to get scuff marks off my daughter's sneakers and true, that's a big task but it crumbled and much more elbow grease was needed than I remember. I think that the ones with the blue scrubber side are better..  I'll try them next time.
112. I bought these for a baby shower gift.  They are excellent quality and look exactly like the picture.
113. I believe all the 5 stars on this product are fakes. There's no way so many people could possibly feel this cheaply made POS deserves such high marks.*Flimsy quality*Head band slides down the back of your head, pulling the mask off*The eye cups just fall off willy nilly and aren't comfortable at all*WORST OF ALL, it lets in a big chunk of light at the gap between the eye cups. I'd block more light by throwing a towel over my eyes!Yup, I got suckered in by the fake reviews, but now my sacrifice is your gain. Don't buy these. They're garbage and there are a number of products available on Amazon that are 100x better. Save your time and money and check out other options, especially ones with hundreds of reviews as some of them might actually be legit.
114. Just what I was looking for.  Extras are nice too.  Box seems to be made well.
115. This cleans my tongue really well without leaving a metallic taste.  I use the scraper every morning, and it really helps me to wake up and feel like my mouth is crystal clean to start the day.  I do dry it off after every use so that it does not rust (and so far, so good!).As a funny note:  I keep this in the same cup as my toothbrush head, and if I lift my toothbrush head out at the wrong angle, the magnet sticks to the scraper and they both come out together!
116. They fit nicely! Some of the oral tips you have to fight to get them in not with this one!
117. I have an allergy to milk and like smoothies! This is the best way to make smoothies when You have an allergy!
118. It's the only cotton I use for my vape for the last 3 years or so. I occasionally order different cotton and every single time I have my vape flavor suffers. At best it dulls the flavor and at worst it adds a chemical-y taste that ruins my vape experience.This is the best cotton I have ever used for my vape. I can't believe how much of a difference it makes. You would think it really wouldn't matter since the juice is doing all the work but it really does.I'm not into the price but for now it's well worth it. Also one bag lasts me a long time so it's not painful at this price point.
119. I absolutely love this straightener. I was so excited to try it that I didn't use any creams, straightening liquids or anything like that. That alone straightened my full frizzy hair. It wasn't perfect ,but I wanted to take a picture of the before and after. I tried it again with straightening oil and it was perfect. It worked best for me when I divide my hair into sections. I did brush my hair before so I don't have knots as to not damage my hair. Easy to comb through hair. The temp was perfect as well. Great item. I would purchase  again if I need to. Recommend!
120. I love this loofah.  It is especially helpful for getting rid of dry skin in winter when I'm cooped up in the house with the drying furnace turned on.  The length is fine for me--5'8" and it would fit a shorter person as well.
121. It would have been useful to know where you can’t use before buying. I read carefully looking for that. I mean there are some places that should be obvious like anus, genitals, nipples and ears. But you also can’t use it around the head or neck and this was purchased to use on the neck.
122. This is a tasty vitamin drink with trace minerals. I've been using it for 2 months and haven't noticed anything amazing but I do feel good about getting my nutrients. What I don't feel good about is, every time I look it up to buy another canister the price is higher! I won't be buying more until the price gets back to just over reasonable as the first 2 were. To me $43. and $44. are a bit high but my friend wanted me to try it. Now its $61.50, just 3 weeks later up 30%. No, I'm not going for it.
123. had  for awhile now and it  hasnt fallen apart, so all is well
124. I really like the gentle whitening qualities and the taste is quite nice too.
125. These crack very easily in the freezer. Most of mine have ended up in the recycling bin.
126. These are so cool!  I only have a quart sized baggie full of liquids to live off of for a month and a only a few clothes to wash a lot.  What to do?  Buy these?  They are simply genius!  I tried them in the sink with some panties and you'll need a few sheets but they definitely clean your clothes without taking up valuable liquid space.  I bought two packs and had room in one pack to shove most of another in one container, so I have about 85 sheets to work with.  I'm good to go for many loads of sink laundry on my trip.
127. Love this product! Works just like it says it will, awesome.
128. I loved it! I just barely got it. It arrived pretty fast... it looks WAY better then I thought it would, feels and looks high end. It works waayyy better than some high ends eyelash curlers I have had & can be compared to other ones that I bought for a ridiculous price. I super recomend this one.. You get a great product for an amazing price.
129. Works fairly well for my plastic frames.
130. These are of high quality and a great deal.
131. I couldn't find Lavoris anywhere for quite a while so was thrilled to find it here!  My husband loves this mouthwash more than any others because of the special cinnamon flavor.
132. This toothbrush is just OK, rated 3 stars. The toothbrush base itself feels very lightweight and cheap. The heads are very hard to get on, and the bristles feel pretty cheap and soft. The toothbrush does have a few different types of "modes" of vibration patterns, but I'm not sure how that would benefit the user.
133. just like my grandmother use to use
134. My wife loves those.Thank you very much.
135. Hot Hot very hot.....But it is very good.If I put this right spot,pain releaf quickly.Just little bit smoky and funny smell.
136. No words. It's great!  I carry it in the car and it's great at stoplights for a quick acupressure in between the shoulder blades!
137. Vile stuff.  Has the texture of liquid oatmeal.
138. I wound up just taping it up where I wanted it, because I needed it! The holder itself is slightly tapered and holds my Waterpick handle just fine, but even without the shower head on it, it falls of in middle of night. I just used some 3M foam tape that is water resistant to attach it - functions fine and less hassle than returning and trying to find something else!
139. The bottles arrived with the plastic lids broken and so it would start to come out.
140. Wonderful product! Makes me feel happy because they are so cute and colorful but more importantly because I'm helping take care of our oceans!!!! Keep up they great work! You deserve 100 stars!!!
141. Pure stuff and works perfectly as intended
142. Very nice album, I will have to chose some very special photographs to insert. :)
143. Very nice, can't wait to finish my current journal to get to use this one!
144. I really enjoy DripDrop when needed.  I can't locate this product in my area so I order from Drip Drop through Amazon.  It's purpose is to hydrate and  I think it works well.
145. Good detergent. Great value. We purchased it to try to get a stain out of a pocelain sink. It didn't help with that. But, it is a wonderful laundry dey.
146. The smell does not last for more than 30 minutes.I bought it for my New Zealand wool dryer balls.I think it is rather expensive for its poor quality.But the smell is nice.
147. Setup was a bit challenging but once I got past that I have loved this scale.  It syncs without fail (more reliably than my Fitbit tracker) and has held up fine despite occasionally being knocked over.  It has traveled 1200 miles in the trunk of my car when I wanted to take it on a month-long trip and is still no worse for wear.  I'm not sure if the body fat percentage is accurate, but the weight seems to be.  Another bonus is that this automatically updates on My Fitness Pal once it syncs!
148. Been using for two weeks and haven't got anything to report yet. Will update after 30 days.
149. I use Ziploc bags frequently because they make high-quality products.  Having the Seahawks logo on the bag makes it that much more special in this Washington-based home! Clear bags are a must for attending games, plus, when you're making special gifts for fellow Seahawks fans, THIS bag makes for a perfect presentation!  Go Seahawks!
150. This has everything and is very organized.The antibiotic oinment is NeomycinThe non asprin is tylenolThe anti bacterial wipes are Benzalkonium ChlorideThis zips up easily and keeps everything organized in its sections. It has everything you could need. I highly recommend this kit to have on hand and one for traveling.* Alcohol Prep Pads* Antiseptic Towlettes* Instant Cold Compress* Tweezers* Safety Pins* Antibiotic Ointment* Burn Cream Ointment* Non-aspirin Tablets*Aspirin Tablets* Sting Relief Pads* Cotton Tip Applicators* Finger Splints* FIRST AID INSTRUCTIONS* Adhesive Bandages (1in x 3in)* Adhesive Bandages (38 in x 1.5 in)* Adhesive Bandages (34 in x 3 in)* Butterfly Closures* Paper Tape Roll (1.5 in x 2.5 yds)* Sterile Gauze Pads (2 in x 2 in)* Sterile Gauze Pads (4 in x 4 in)* Sterile Trauma Pads (5 in x 9 in)* Examination GlovesI received this product at a discount in exchange for feedback and an honest review
151. I have always liked the cleaning job Mr. Clean Erasers did, but I hated the thin pads that wore away quickly and shredded. These pads are amazing. They don't shred into small pieces , and they scrub hard , dried messes. Love them for baseboard cleaning and quick wipe downs of nasty messes.
152. I bought one of these to use as a gris-gris bag. It's a fantastic and well-made little pouch; the leather is soft and wearing very well, and the antler button stays put and opens easily. It has a good energy about it, too, and has been excellent to work with. I'm quite happy with the purchase and am hoping for an excuse to give one as a gift in the future.
153. Wonderful set! Sturdy and well made!!
154. We use this to get my mom's wheelchair from our kitchen into the sunroom.  It works great.  Very sturdy
155. I have about 4 different kinds of medicine and this is perfect. Before I bought this I would dig through my purse looking for different bottles, but now I just look for my little grey box and everything is right there. It has never come open on its own, which is also a plus.
156. On antibiotics which just destroyed my gut bacteria...this fixed it. The name sucks but the product is good.
157. Bought this when I was a little strapped for cash and needed wick for my attys. This works extremely well. No wicking time, very soft, very workable and it is economically sound. I love my Cotton Bacon and Torii Wicks, but I definitely will stock up on these and keep them in my supply.
158. I had a ring that was a size too big and I bought these.  They are very uncomfortable and you are constantly aware that you have something extra around your finger.  Remember wrapping tape around the ring to make it fit better and how uncomfortable that was?  Well, it feels just like that. I wound up exchanging the ring for a smaller size and using these to wrap around my charger cord where it started to fray. It works better that way. Charger cords don't complain about being uncomfortable.
159. I have tried many diet supplements on the market, most of them without results. I decided to try this one and their &#34;carb and fat attack&#34; (I also reviewed that one). This supplement, while I have not lost any weight yet, it did stop my weight from climbing, so I am going to assume that I am in a transition (plateau) phase. I haven't been exercising regularly, so I am sure that is attributing to my stall.  I started walking more regularly and eating better, in conjunction with the other supplement, vitamins and fruit smoothies, I'm sure that with this product the weight will start to come off.Now, as for effectiveness, I DO notice a change in my energy. I suffer from severe fatigue and I do find that I have more energy throughout the day when I take this. I keep it down to a minimum because of the caffeine, because I REFUSE to give up coffee and taking the full dosage with coffee does have me climbing the walls, so I reduced the dosage to 1 mug of coffee in the morning and 1 capsule before lunch to keep my energy up. This works for me. I am sure it will take longer for me to see weight reduction results because I am taking a smaller dosage, but I am sure that I need to be on this for more than a month to see the results. And considering that I am having no ill side effects and everything seems to be okay, I think I will stick with this for a while longer and post my results of weight loss (if any) at a later date. For energy, I highly recommend.
160. I purchased this in July. It is now October, so I think that I have used it (off and on) long enough to give a review.I say off and on because I am not the most dedicated person in the world when it comes to dieting and taking vitamins and supplements. With that said, I am very pleased with this product. It does what it says, blocks the fat and carbs that you eat with your meals.  I warn you, that you WILL see the results of that in your bathroom breaks in 8-12 hours. You do become more &#34;regular&#34;, that's how I know it is working. I noticed that I do find myself adjusting my fat and carb intake depending on how often I have to go to the bathroom, so in that respect, the product is encouraging me to alter my eating habits. The bottle is 60 capsules, so if you take it diligently it should only last you about a month. But as I said, I'm not diligent so this bottle lasted me until now. I took maybe two capsules a day maybe twice a week (when I remember to).  Even then, I saw the results.  I have not lost much weight yet, but I haven't gained any either, and it is encouraging to know that I can continue to use this as a constant reminder to cut back on the chips and ice cream. (notice I didn't say CUT OUT chips and ice cream heehee!)
161. I had just finished my first bottle of Vegan Morning multi-vitamin the day before and opened a new bottle.  Right after taking the dose I felt my face burning - looked in the mirror and it was bright red.  Then my arms also started burning and turned red.  It was scary!  I drank a good 6 glasses of water to dilute the reaction.  Funny thing, I noticed that the seal was raised up when I opened the bottle, and the liquid was a different color.  My husband had emailed the company yesterday and still have received no response.  The bottle says unconditionally guaranteed.  I do not recommend this product.
162. painful when used ..returned it
163. It took a little getting used to but I really like this makeup sponge. Easy to clean and didn't absorb any product like a brush or regular sponge does. Blending is a little tricky though.
164. These are some of the best protein bars I've ever had. Delicious and no chemical aftertaste. Every flavor is great but the white chocolate cookie is my favorite.
165. I will keep them, because I could can cut a piece of soft fabric (moleskin ?) to line with first, but in my opinion this “cushion” is worse on the sores than the furniture it is “protecting” against.  It is NOT a soft gel cushion.  It’s more like the scratchy styrofoam peanuts used in packaging - but thicker. Maybe I can find a gel pad to line it with. I have it two stars because I like the netted sleeve.  For AZ heat that is ideal. So, it has some value to me and  Not worth returning. But NOT soft enough to use for Bed Sores- that’s for sure!!!
166. this is a quick and efficient way to get rid of stains.  It works very, very well.
167. With so many plant saucers to choose from on Amazon, not sure why I selected these but they are the best saucers I have ever purchased.  Not a drop of water will ever get thru these things.  Nice think plastic - not like those flimsy ones you can purchase at the box stores that bend and are easily punctured.  Would definitely recommend.
168. ALWAYS READ DETAILS.  I did not this time, and I regret it.  This set up is way to small, but I tried it anyway.  It didn't last anytime as I suspected, plus it didn't cut the leg hair at all.
169. Don't waste your money. It worked well for a month and stopped and my window to return has expired.
170. Glad to have this available on Amazon because I do not have a Trader Joes near me! We love this product and have for years!
171. The brand seems to have changed names twice since I've been using it and the new packaging is the same bottle they have always used but now it is also placed in a sealed heavy plastic bag...very, very wasteful and such a poor use of plastic for a company putting out 'organic' items especially. They already had a seal on the bottle and the cap is wrapped in a plastic band so the bag is truly wasteful. Also, I believe the mg in each bottle has changed at least twice...I believe 3 times...just seems sketchy since it was not advertised to have changed, I only knew by reading the package.  That said, it seems to work perfectly well, I just may start looking for another brand that gives me more confidence and less waste.
172. Love this stuff.. it has alot of health benifits.. and I don't have and issue with the taste of vinegar but my daughter also uses it  and she likes the taste too.. it took her about a week and now she even puts it in her water and like the taste.. the best part is it is natural!!!
173. In September I purchased one of these. It worked as it should for two weeks, approximately 15 hours total use. On day 15 when I turned it on it had only half the brightness and a blackish film coating the inside of it. I messaged the seller, Light Bulbs International and they were kind enough to send me out a replacement. The replacement worked out great for exactly 7 days. Today, day 8 the replacement bulb went bad and developed the same blackish blue film inside it again! After approximately 20 minutes the bulb just went out. I removed it from the fixture to find that one of the filaments had broken. See pictures attached. This is so frustrating! Perhaps these bulbs are just old stock or from a defective batch. It’s not my fixture. I had been and am using now a GE bulb that I purchased at my local hardware store that works without issue. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2020 DO NOT PURCHASE THESE BULBS!  THEY ARE DEFECTIVE! These Sylvania bulbs used to be the best. I have used them for many years and each one lasted several years. The bulbs here are JUNK!!!
174. Great value and a lot of sounds to choose from. Doesn't seem to loop either
175. The product does last longer and is stronger than the original formula.
176. Granddaughter really likes it
177. This Shiatsu Neck and Back Massager has 4 massage nods help get a nice deep muscle massage and an added heat option to help blood circulation.  It has a car charger that allows you to operate it in your car and a strap to secure it.  This comes with a massager pillow, power cord, car adapter and  easy to understand directionsI have a lot of back and neck pain and boy does this help it.  It just massaged the tightness and pain from them.  It has strong. powerful rollers and a one minute timer which switches directions of the rollers after a minute.This is not cordless, you must be near an outlet to use this.I received this neck and back massager to use, review and to give my honest opinion about it.
178. My husband is a diabetic and he has a lot of nerve pain in his feet because of this. I purchased this for him to try because it is 100% pure, natural and herbal. He has been taking 2 capsules a day for a while now and he is starting to notice less burning and tingling in his feet.  This is allowing him to finally get a full nights sleep, before he was up walking the floor in pain for hours.  Hopefully with continued use his feet pain will go away all together. I  received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review
179. This works well
180. I have to have a bandage that doesn’t stick to the wound.
181. For my grandson. He likes them and so does my daughter. Saves a bit of money.
182. i have been using this for several years and was happy with this product until last week.  For some reason, when I put in my contact lens,  it the heck out of my eye (hydrogen peroxide did not convert)  but also about a one inch long line on my skin just outside my eye. It burned my skin!  I've decided to research and find a different, safer product.  (I did not purchase this product through Amazon, but am looking at reviews of others concerning this).
183. Way to difficult to use would not recommend
184. I have not yet been able to figure out how to have the light come on at the time that I want it to. I have been through the poor instruction book that came with it, but can't figure out how to program the @&## thing to work. The display light is a bit too bright for when the lights are off, and the nature sounds are annoying. I think you need to keep looking if you are looking for a lamp that slowly lights up in the a.m.
185. The Vigor Force Knee Support Sleeve came in a plastic pouch. It is has a dark gray and white color scheme. I have a knee that needed added support and compression support knee sleeve.This knee sleeve comes with magnetic therapy to help with pain. I thought was just thing to do that . But I got on my swollen knee but it just rolled down and became painful to keep on. The Vigor Force Knee Support Sleeve is the nicest and professional grade knee ; I have purchased. I received this item for free for my honest and unbiased review. .
186. I have a so sitting service and always send treats home with the pups
187. These little eye droppers don't suck the water into the vial. That's all, don't buy them.
188. Originally I thought these files would work just like my crystal nail file from Perfect Formula, a file I have had for years. My nails were all finally strong, healthy and grown out.After using these files my nails are shredding, peeling and down to the nubs! Several of the top layers of my nails are peeling back even further. Some nails have 2, 3 & 4 cracks up the nail. I just had a horribly painful crack and it tore to the skin.I thought all these crystal nail files would be the same, but they are not!
189. I bought these replacement mineral heads to replace the dulling ones on my ENJI Happy Care callus remover. They fit my callus remover perfectly and can be put on and removed with no problem whatsoever. These new rollers work perfectly and did an excellent job at removing the calluses on my feet.
190. Pretty design. Held a good amount of smaller pills. But it would pop open in my purse, if the pills where small they would get shuffled and damaged.
191. Good product and great value
192. I've been using the Aria for about a month now and I'm really pleased with it. I like that it takes a new measurement every time you step on. I've had some scales in the past that didn't seem to budge unless you lost or gained a pound or two, and sometimes that big jump was quite unwelcome. It measures quickly, identifies me and syncs right to my Fitbit account immediately. I was initially concerned because the bathroom that it is located in has the worst wifi connection in my whole house, but so far I haven't missed a single reading on it.The bodyfat % definitely does fluctuate, but as I'm familiar with other devices that measure bodyfat I also know that things as simple as whether your stomach is empty or full and how dehydrated you are can cause this to fluctuate quite a bit. The percentage itself might not be extremely accurate, but if you weigh yourself at the same time and under similar circumstances daily (ie. first thing in the morning before you've eaten or had anything to drink), then it is accurate enough to let you know whether your percentage is increasing or decreasing over time. This isn't a professional bodyfat measuring tool, and it's unreasonable to expect it to work as well as one.I'm the only one currently using my scale so I can't comment on the difficulties some people have with multiple users or guest users. Setting it up was extremely simple and now I don't have to wonder if I remembered to log my weight in my Fitbit account or not. In fact now I can't do things like &#34;forget&#34; to log my weight after a rough weekend. I like to know where I'm at on my journey so I don't find myself avoiding getting on the scale to avoid having the weight logged, which I was actually worried about. Overall it has just become a comfortable part of my routine and caused me to have to be a bit more accountable to myself. I'm quite happy with my Aria.
193. Perfect for double checking my line ups at the shop. With this comb, my clients leave more confidence and helps me assure they have a fresh cut. The Flat top comb was good edition although i have plenty. The Rhinocomb is also heat resistant so you can be sure it wont melt if you use any sort of hot tools. We also use this comb for permanent tattoos in eyebrows as well. The yellow tab is removable so you can freely use it as a ruler but the yellow tab helps a lot when comparing two sides. My designs also come out much more even and I highly recommend this to any barber or stylist!
194. I was very dissapointed.  For the last year all I have heard is that wraps and herbal gels are the best thing since sliced bread.  Well, I was not impressed.  I applied the Herbal Body Wrap Gel sold by Forever Young to my thighs and arms.  The amazon ad said to just apply the gel to targeted areas.  Well I did.  I did twice a day.  I did this for a week.  Nothing.I was using this as a jumpstart to my new yoga and new lifestyle.  I know nothing is a golden pill to a perfect body, but seriously I did expect something.Disclosure:  I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.  The above review is my opinion.
195. I was very excited for these to arrive, as I've been looking for an affordable back massage tool. When I opened the package I was so disappointed at what I actually received. The tools looked as if they were put together half-hazardly.The legs of the massager were uneven. For some reason they were all slightly different lengths, so I couldn't even use it effectively. The wood coating was also messy and not smooth at all. There were globs and bubbles of dried coating on the wooden surface.I know this was a relatively inexpensive massager, but I can't even enjoy at least one use. So in my opinion, I would certainly recommend spending a little more for a better quality product.
196. Fairly good case: sturdy, seems to be put together well.  Needs a little more headroom above the bottles for reference books, papers, etc.  I am always afraid my bottles will leak so do not use the handle.  Needs a handle to carry flat.
197. As other reviews have indicated this is a harder pumice than many making it last longer.  I would have given five stars except that it failed to remove a coffee ring around the disposal in sink despite several attempts.  On other hand on a linoleum floor there were some marks I could not get up with other cleaners and this did well.  Same is true of rings in toilet.  Handle is very handy and comes nicely packaged.  Was larger than I thought it would be so it is nice when working in toilet bowls for example.  Two sticks nice so can keep one for bathroom use and one for kitchen etc.
198. My husband's nice prescription glasses lost one of their nose pieces and we didn't want to go back to the eye doctor so I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a try.  They were the perfect replacement for the one he lost and are exactly the same quality as those that came from an optical dispensary.  There are enough in this package, that I probably won't ever have to buy another pair.
199. these are absolutely worthless.  I bought them assuming they would work like others that foam up into the sink and clean while foaming.  these have absolutely no foaming or cleaning ability that I can tell and they don't get rid of any smells.
200. Absolutely love these!Our whole family are Doctor Who fans, but I got these Dalek socks for my daughter for back to school.She was SO thrilled with them! In vibrant blue and orange, with one pair in a nice grey shade, they will work with a variety of outfits.They hit just over the heel, and the socks are soft and comfy. My daughter wore them and loved the fit and feel, as well as decoration on them!Any Doctor Who fan will love em!*Provided for my opinion and review
201. this is a fantastic kit!Well made, perfect size for travel or to store at home in the bathroom or kitchen.I love the case, it is actually even nicer than I was expecting!Super sturday, great color that is easy to see when you need to find it in a hurry, and it is filled with 200 pcs of first aid items to save you in time of need.We have already used this multiple times!LOVE ITI appreciate receiving this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased views
202. I have been mixing this powder into my morning smoothies.. not part of a workout routine.. just for added energy and nutrition. I really like it and cannot taste the powder at all! I highly recommend this powder. My old gripe is that the packaging is a little small.. or smaller than I expected.. and there is no measuring spoon (or tool) included. Given the size of the container, this is to be expected, but I wanted to let buyers know.**I disclose that I have received this item as a free gift or at a discount.

203. Uses all product instead of absorbing it. It does take more patience and blending but I love it! I don't feel dirty after using it!
204. I love this brand! I ordered several of the hair styling products and this company is amazing! The quality is outstanding and the performance is even better! The active performance gel is is really easy to apply. It is a blue gel, smells amazing, and is pretty thick. I use it to help tame my frizz with my long wavy hair. I apply it after I get out of the shower to help with the frizz when drying and to maximize my curls and it keep s the hold all day. The gel is pretty thick when applying and goes a long way so this product will definitely last a long time and I have very long hair. I did receive this product at a discounted rate to provide to the public my honest and unbiased review.
205. These tasty and nutritious bars are worth the price. They are filling. There is no chocolate in them, just carob. They do have mik and peanut butter however.
206. I used it once, very happy with scent and the way it cleaned my mat.  But as I tried to use it second time, the spray mechanism on bottle does not push down completely and the spray just drips out.  I tried fixing it to no avail.  Otherwise would give it five stars.
207. This massager works very well and it does have heat setting.  I use it primarily on my neck but I did use it on the back of each leg too - which also felt FANTASTIC.  It gives a shiatsu style massage - meaning it has kind of these balls inside that knead around and help loosen up your muscles.  I mostly keep it by my bed and grab it right before bedtime to relax for about 15 minutes or so before sleep.  Its a leather type material so its easy to wipe clean if you get fingerprints on it, etc.  Overall, I have to say I highly recommend it.
208. This was a REALLY good deal.  I actually ended up with a couple types of dishwasher soaps (small bags of them), stain remover, gain laundry soap, gain scent booster type product (full size), and some more.  That was WELL worth the money - plus I got the full purchase price back in credit to use on other cleaning products which I took full advantage of!  I highly recommend this box!
209. Sadly,  quite overpriced  and did not work for me  like other brands.As to the cleanlinesspurity factor of this product- that was a big  plus and the main reason I bought this brand to try.But it kind of makes the purity point moot if it does not work for me as well as the many now dubbed *tainted brands* out there.I thought it was great to find Chlorella made atfrom a so called *clean source*.  I will  still search high and low, for quality Chlorella that does not come from contaminated areas( no easy task).For the money spent to get such purity, with this brand the results were just not there and proved to be money tossed out the window.I wanted to like this product-even despite it being pricey.  I am sorry I didn't.  I also can't say their claims of being the ONLY pure source of Chlorella is true or not.I would need to research further. All I know right now, is what countriesplaces to AVOID getting Chlorella from, and unfortunately they are the same exact places that are providing companies with Chlorella.
210. This product is fanastic i love the flavor and the fast acting that happens after you chew them the taste is great not chalky at all
211. I like these containers and they did NOT leak when I filled them with my hippy sunblock brew.  However, only four stars because this set doesn't really screw back down.
212. You use more elbow grease to get things clean then the actual product cleans. May as well use a lemon and salt for all the scrubbing that you have to do
213. Very cute but loses a star for not coming with any directions.  There is a line on the back that says vinegar,  so I'm assuming you fill it to the lin6with vinegar,  but for how long do you microwave it? I will have to research.
214. used in coconut carrier oil for psoriasis, didn't seem to help, but great for other things I'm sure
215. One side where the the plug is heats up a little just around that area but noheating on largest part across the back or on the right side attachment…..soyou have to sit near the plug outlet and hold it up to the area you need and allareas are cold…it’s totally crazy and 100% ripoff….it’s so bad I don’t feel right giving it to Goodwill
216. Wanted to love this item! I was recommended this item  by a coworker and I was disappointed since it didn't really seem to do the job in my bathroom. Really disappointed!
217. I thought the flavor was going to be blah..actually it doesn't have a taste to me.
218. Decent for the price
219. These are ok although my daughter hasnt shown much interest in them. They also seem to be a bit of a hazard once shes walking and could fall with this in her mouth.
220. So much better than the ball gag - per my husband ;)Confortable to wear. Good quality.
221. Guardian Technologies GG10002PK GermGuardian Pluggable UV-C Sanitizer and DeodorizerWe used to travel a lot for my husband’s work, we carried 2 of these with us at all times to help combat any remaining smells in hotel rooms as well as it worked amazing when we would cook something strong in rooms that had non opening windows.  We now are in a home, and I can tell which rooms I have these in.  I need to get more and have them in more rooms!  We have two in our bedroom; just because our dog spends so much time in there we wanted the extra effort.  We can make fried fish for dinner and you can smell it in the rooms that do not have the filters in them.  By the time we go to bed, there is not a single trace of it in the air.  And our bedroom is just a very short hall off of the kitchen!  Excellent product!
222. We purchased these for use in hotels as we travel alot!  These have been fantastic at taking that unknown as well as the known orders from hotel rooms.  Not to mention just deleting cooking smells when we have a room that has a kitchen, but no windows that open or fans.  Even fish!
223. Works great! came quick! Love it great color
224. Works well and seems to last awhile
225. Bought this for my daughters law and she just loves it. She gets to practice at home away from her job. She was pleased so I am satisfied. The delivery was quick and the packaging who great.
226. When I got it the seal was open I’m pretty sure it’s fine other than that I love it!
227. Arrived on time, item as described.
228. Works very well for what we're using it for. Highly recommend. The gold makes me feel fancy when I use it.
229. I really loved this product. By far the best one I've owned. It looked great with my mascara. I could not be happier with it.
230. Some of the bristles bent after just a few times of using it, which is causing it to really snag and pull hair now.  Concept is great, but wish it had lasted longer.Update: Seller contacted me quickly about my review, and will be refunding this. I appreciate the great customer service!
231. Very nice little organizer, a bit bigger than I needed since I don't wear a lot of jewelry, but will help me make sure my jewelry doesn't get lost in the bottom of my bag when I travel.
232. Love this little eyelash curler. I have naturally long eyelashes and when I just use mascara it tends to straighten them out for some reason. This curler works well with or without mascara. Even with mascara your eyelashes don't stick to the pad. The finger holes have a rubber grip so your fingers aren't slipping while using it. This package does come with an extra pad which is always nice but I feel you'll get quite a while of use with the first one. I received this item complimentary for my unbiased review.
233. Super soft! Nice color. Item is as described. Very happy with purchase. My 5th grader loves it! Very comfy to sleep in and adjustable for all sizes.
234. Not really sure that this is doing anything that a wash rag doesn't. It seems to be making my skin flaky, maybe that is how it works, getting rid of old bad skin cells. I am hoping that it will get better, and there is a new younger me is under all that flaky skin :). so far, I haven't made up my mind, but I keep getting emails from the company, to review their product, so here it is.
235. ~BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER.HARD TO FIND WHITENING AS WELL AS CLEAN MINT.FAST DELIVERY~
236. This product does not fit a drive walker. It was a total waste of time and money.If you have a drive brand walker do not bother to buy this tray!!
237. Have been using this chair for 5 months now and it's still very comfortable.
238. My son absolutely loves them!  They arrived two days ago and he couldn't be happier.  They are very realistic looking and his father, from a short distance, actually thought he had been scratched by some kittens we are fostering.  My son loved fooling his father!  I bought these through a promotional event, but the price was not discounted, it was available to everyone who purchased them on that date.  I am so happy I took advantage of the opportunity.  I purchased four sets and my son can't wait to use them for Halloween!
239. I have purchased several Hekunn wooden spoons in the past and love them all.  This one is no exception.  It is high quality and put any wooden spoons I've purchased at department stores to shame.  I was able to participate in a promotional event and receive the spoon at a discounted price in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review.  I gladly would have paid full price, though, because I love this company's products and I know they are worth the price.  They are beautiful as well as functional.  They are safe to use in non stick pans and also sturdy enough to use for stirring.  Before this spoon arrived their spatula had been my favorite product of theirs.  This right up there with it!  I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and appreciate any quality products that make my time in there easier and more enjoyable.  Products from Hekunn definitely fit that bill!  The products do take longer than some other products to arrive, but they are worth the wait!
240. Wore them out already. They were super comfy.
241. Since Clarisonic went out of business and you can't find the replacement brushes anywhere anymore I ordered these as to try to avoid starting over with a new face brush brand and having to buy the whole appliance again.  These  replacement heads fit my Mia 2 just fine, the brush it self is a lower quality, and not as good a Clairsonic and when turned on the center circle vibrates oddly (almost like the cent of the brush is going to pop out as it has a 'loose' feel to it, but I've used it 4x now and it seems to be staying in place even with the odd movement and vibration.  The bristles are not as robuststiff as the Clairsonic so my face certainly doesn't feel as smooth and clean as before, but I guess it's better than nothing at this point, so I'm keeping these replacement heads.  I mean they are about 50% cheaper than the name brand and you can tell the quality is about 50% as good, you do get what you pay for.UPDATE 25OCT2020: I feel taken advantage of my this seller, I purchased 4 Facial Cleansing Brush Head Replacements a few months ago for $25.98, now they are $5.98 for the SAME 4 PACK!  I think the quality is worth the NEW price, but if the price ever jumps above $10 for a 4 pack DON'T DO IT, they are cheaply made and not holding up well with daily use.
242. Quality pads and thoroughly soaked in witch hazel.  Convenient and good price.  I use these on my face, neck and ears.  Also use to clean scratches and cuts.
243. This pet pill syringe makes giving medication much easier. I have one dog that runs at the sounds of the pill bottle because she loves the pocket treats and another who you have to hold down to take anything.  We have tried everything to get her to take pills and she always spits them out. With this pill syringe we are able to force them down her throat with the first attempt. The syringe comes with two different sizes but currently we only need one. The syringe also allows you to put water with the pill which I think makes it harder to spit out. This is a great addition to the monthly routine for our animals.I have received this pet pill syringe at a discounted price or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product.

244. This was a really cute looking toothbrush that my daughter really wanted.  Unfortunately, the quality of the brush is really lacking.  It randomly turns onoff.  When she pushes the button it's a luck of the draw if it will actually turn on.  At least she still brushes her teeth though.
245. Update to my review from 2009:I have found the same product for much cheaper at my local Costco: a bottle of Kirkland "Mucus Relief Chest Guaifenesin 400 mg, 200 tablets" for $11.55 ($0.06400 mg tablet) instead of this ProHealth product of 100 tablets for ~$20 ($0.20400 mg tablet). The ProHealth is over 3 times the price!  And the Kirkland brand tablets are MUCH easier to swallow.The price at my local Costco is currently cheaper, btw, than buying the same Kirkland bottle on amazon (http:www.amazon.comKirkland-Signature-Expectorant-Guaifenesin-Immediate-ReleasedpB002RL8FIEref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1291354212&sr=1-1)======================First, my product reviewPros:- Eliminates my snoring! (see below, your mileage will vary)- The least expensive product (per mg) that I have found so far.- Shipping has been reliable from this vendor.- Product is 100% guaifenesin (no decongestent, etc..)Cons- As previously posted by another reviewer, they can be difficult to swallow because of their size and the fact they are not coated. I have a large mouth :)  so not so much a problem for me, but those with smaller mouthsthroats (like my wife) might have more difficulty.I have been taking Guaifenesin for the last 5+ years. My allergy doctor recommends taking it when I first notice allergy or cold symptoms as a means to help me combat the allergycold and recuperate faster.I used to snore often and thought I had sleep apnea (I don't, according to an overnight sleep study). My wife and I were both sleeping poorly from my snoring and our quality of life was greatly impacted.  She made this (life-saving!) observation that I did not snore when I was on the guaifenesin when I was taking it for coldallergy symptoms.Given how guaifenesin is rated as a relatively safe drug, my allergy doctor saw no harm in taking it regularly and told me that, although it is not advertised to help address snoring, he could see how thinning the mucus (that I often have) would make breathing through my air passage easier and reduce the snoring.Guaifenesin might not help your snoring at all, but I would certainly recommend that you talk to your doctor if you have a snoring problem and ask if it makes sense to try it.Pierre
246. It works!!
247. I have rust on my water pretty bad. I even have a decent filtration system going on and my bath tube still needs to be cleaned once a week. This is the only stuff that I found that you can spray on and then just spray clean. Once in awhile you might have to wipe or scrub a little...depending on the rust stain. I have used every producr I can think of to tey and find a replacement but notbing comes close. This stuff is hard to find in stores. I would not bother wasting your money on anything else because thslis stuff is the best.
248. nice looking scale, does what it says
249. This is great for my contacts!  I use it to rinse off the contact solution they stay in each night. And I love being able to get 3 cans at once.
250. Love this and would have given five stars if I could, but the product's F box for Fridays snapped off on one side, so I just leave it open on that side and hope it doesn't open too much. Otherwise, I love how much I can fit into it, and I think it's quite stylish.  I like that it's not a box but more a cylinder shape, easier to keep in a handbag or purse. Love the colors too, I can't lie!  :)
251. I bought the germguardian to deal with kitty litter smell. The kitty litter box is in the spare bedroom's bathroom, and I have not been able to control the odor until now. I run the germguardian 24x7 and it eliminates the smell 100%. The spare bedroom is now the best smelling room in my house. I'm definitely getting a couple more of these guys.I have been running it a little over a week, so I cannot comment on the units reliability. I have my fingers crossed it will last a while.
252. I wanted to use this for my two aquariums.  I use well water with a known pH value (state lab & API drop test) with a mixture of reverse osmosis water (also known ph).  I was hoping to pin down my pH in the tank which is likely somewhere between 7 and 7.5, but the API drop tests are hard to differentiate in this range.  So I already had a ball park idea what the answer should be.  These strips were easily a full point too low (acidic when it is definitely basic).  Side note--I was using a pipette to place my drops on the strip.Also, some strips are test side down in the kit.  Others are test side up which makes it hard to keep your fingers off.  They really need to be all down to keep from being contaminated.
253. Picture shown, shows it opens WIDE!  **It DOES NOT!**  I have 2 at home just like this.Sending back. Looks well made, but wanted  one with a WIDER OPENING.
254. Does the job it's supposed to do. Good purchase!  Wish the handle was a little bit longer.
255. Does the pad need to be moistened?
256. Sadly as cute as they are, the scent didn't last more than a day. I will use them all but I don't think I will return for more.
257. Perfect for sunburn, itchy or dry skin.
258. A nice fiber pick-me-up, for no guilt snacks, andor light meal replacement. They taste healthy not real sweet but pleasant.
259. I've had mine for two years and it still works. I smoke every day, sometimes a few times a day. I only use one-hitters though, so not a lot of smoke is going through these. I threw away the caps when I got it. They're useless. The thing needs to be open so it can air out. Your breath has a lot of moisture. I have two regular smoke buddies, and one junior. I love them all. However, I accidentally put my junior one in the washer (yes, the smoke buddy was unusable after this) and it made a mess in my washer, but that's my fault. I love these. They are a bit harder to blow through now that mine is so old, but I just can't afford another one. Thankfully, mine still works.
260. My wife love it. Well built and less cost. Great for travel and daily use
261. It may be a particular brand of tennis shoe, but when I walk for long periods of time in them, my toes start to hurt. Usually it is my second toe and it hurt like it was sprained.  Anyway, I am overweight and attributed a lot of the problem to my weight, but noticed with other sneakersflip flops, etc. with the same distance when walking, the pain didn't happen.  The tennis shoes were expensive and it was too late to return them so instead of losing out on being able to wear them entirely, I thought to try these.  They worked and they worked well.  I don't experience that same pain in my toes or when it does, it is after walking over two miles and not on the first mile.  A fairly inexpensive fix to the problem, but next time I go to purchase new walking shoes, I will try a different brand.
262. Maty's is the best chest rub I have found after 15 years of being a mom and 4 children nothing I have found works better. In addition to so thing a cough and cold it is very calming. The all natural ingredients don't leave a greasy feeling in irritate the skin. We don't only use it for illness, we use it when my children ...the 15, 12, 9 or 4 year old are feeling anxious or sleepless. On the chest and feet, you will be amazed ! I never want to be without this so I keep a backup jar in our medicine cabinet at all times.
263. nice face soap, gentle...pore reducing?  not so much
264. So far, so good! It doesn't smell like anything, and I seem to be consistently picking up grime on the towel every time I wipe it down, so it seems to be working. I do feel like I need more than 3 sprays to clean the mat, though.
265. First off, I regularly use the manual foot files and I usually don't get the results I am looking for no matter what brand I use.  My feet get pretty dry and if I get lazy and don't take of my feet regularly, then I have to work extra hard to get my desired smoothness.  That being said, I didn't file my feet at all while I was waiting for this to arrive in the mail because I wanted to see how it worked on not already smooth feet.  I used it for about 10 minutes or so and my feet looked great.  I didn't have to apply much pressure at all and it easily and effortlessly took off the dead skin and left me with smooth, healthy feet.  The handle is very comfortable to hold while using the callus remover and it comes with a small brush to keep your tool clean.  It small enough that it stores easily without taking up much room.  Great product, especially for the price.  I will absolutely continue to use this a regular part of my beauty routine.
266. Easy to use, smells great and it's all natural!  I love, LOVE Method products!
267. Excellent product.  Helps reduce coughing.
268. Light weight, love the colors and they do not bother my neck when I am wearing them.
269. I hardly realize I'm wearing it.  I was a little suprised by the light-weight fabric and wondered if it would even work.  But so far, so good.  It is very easy to put on, stays in place and is comfortable.
270. Been using for almost two weeks now and so far I love it. Love that they’re individually wrapped. Will continue to keep using!
271. It actually works, it's not a quick relief but it takes the headache away. It does not feel greasy or sticky.
272. It is a fine product but a little shaky when I had to use it.It needs a counter balance-weight.
273. Shipped quickly, no problem attaching to walker
274. When I saw that these were glass, they sounded a little dangerous to me. I kept picturing thin glass breaking easily and cutting myself. This isn't the case at all,with this product. The files are thick, with a white, frosty glass look. They have pretty handles, each a different color. They come in a very nice, small zippered  white case, small enough to fit into a purse or maybe even a makeup bag.I think this product is great! I've used thin files, foam files, and metal files and none of those file my nails the way these do. With those types of nail files, I tend to get jagged edges on my nails, which is so disappointing, because I have to keep filing and filing. These glass files leave my nails looking very nice, and I can file them a lot quicker.I really, really like these. They're  a beauty must.I received this product in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are my own.
275. I like using this right after a shower. AND, it came with a lovely silk-like case.
276. Very comfortable, which surprised me! I love that it doesn't press against your eyes. I also suffer from extremely dry eyes, especially in the morning when I wake up, due to multiple fans running at night. This mask helped keep the moving air away from my eyes, which in turn led to waking up with a lot less pain!!! The added darkness was an added bonus!
277. Works as intended
278. So far so good. I watched the cats on our cameras turn away from where I sprayed this product. The only problem is you need to spray it about every other day. I hope this continues to work or the next stop for the cats is the humane league.
279. I like the small size and no filter needed features in this inexpensive air purifier.  It plugs in to an outlet easily and produces small amount of white noise. Works well when used in combination with larger Germ Guardian units in other rooms.  My two plug in units are used in a small powder room with a litter box and the vanity bath area in my dressing room attached to a bathroom.  Our house is equipped with UV lights and strong filters on total house air conditioningheating equipment as well. I also use an IQ air purifier unit for my large open plan livingdiningmedia room combo.  Needless to say I can't tell which air purifiers are doing the best job, but in combination they keep my house clean of dust, odors and most allergens.
280. This scale doesn't really work properly. it doesn't "lock on" the weight when it is done. I suppose I should send it back, but it's not worth the shipping money in order to get a new one.
281. I have very mixed feeling about this curling iron. On the one hand, its pretty inexpensive and its does produce lovely curls that last for days, on the other hand....1. there is no temperature control, its either on or off2. its gets REALLY REALLY REALLY hot3. it gets so hot that it really isnt good for my hair type4. i've burned myself with it twice now, one time pretty badly through the heat resistance glove.5. there is no stand to put in down on and since it gets so hot I don't want to put it on my counter top, so its a little awkward to useI've missed the return window and like I said it DOES curl my hair well, but I don't think I can really recommend it to anyone else in good conscious.
282. These are pretty good for general noise cancelling - mowing the lawn, sporting events, etc, but I wouldn’t recommend them for shooting. None of them felt like they protected my hearing as well as my over the ear protectors do.
283. These go with the TENS unit I bought and are wonderful on my lower back.  Would recommend all their products highly.
284. Full disclosure- at first I was totally mad because each roll seemed like it only had a few sticky papers on it, kind of like what you buy at the dollar store. Then I used it. What I like most is that the papers are on a diagonal and it is SO MUCH EASIER than the ones that are horizontal. Finding those and peeling them off is a pain. This is totally easy and the papers are much thinner, so even though it's a thin roll, there's a lot on there. I love these little things.
285. I must not have read the size before purchase. They're huge! But well made and very pretty.
286. This product is okay.  The steam is nice, but I think I was hoping for more straightening power.  I must be used to the flat iron.  This is not it.  However, it does do what it says it will do.  Maybe my issue was user error...?
287. I ordered and quickly received the KINGDOMCARES Salon Fast Natural Straight Hair Straightener Brush Fastest Heating Detangling Styling PTC Hair Straightening Brush 3 Levels Anti-Scald Comb Purple Anti-Static Ceramic Hair Straighteners.  My wife has long hair and fixes it every morning before she goes to work and then at night before church the nights we have church.  This bad boy came in and I surprised her when she came home from work before we had church service tonight. First of all I scored major points for the surprise present and second of all how well it worked!  The package comes with one (1) Hair Straightener; one (1) power cord; two (2) Alligator clips, and a User Manual written in English.  First of all this hair straightener is very light weight so it is easy to hold in my wife's hands.  The alligator clips are so that you can section off your hair into sections and straighten your hair out that way as well. It has a total of three different settings and the highest setting doesn't exceed 365 degrees which is perfect. My wife loves to straighten her hair and blow drys it and her hair isn't extremely curly but it does have some waves in it after it has air dried. She found that this straightener works perfectly for grabbing her hair and straightening it quickly without damage to her hair. She makes sure she adds heat protector to her hair before she used it. She loves how the bristles on the straightener grabs her hair and they do not tug or pull on her hair like her other straighteners that you are suppose to use to brush through your hair. I also find that it calms all her frizz in her hair as well as makes her hair silky smooth and soft. After she is done using the straightener her hair looks extremely healthy.  She loves it and I love how her hair looks using this straightener by Kingdomcares.  I recommend all my friends to buy this for their wives and daughters!;  I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

288. I ordered and quickly received the Pure Science DGL Licorice 500mg - Contains 10% Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root - Supports Digestive & Respiratory Function - 50 Vegetarian Capsules. The bottle arrived with a quality control seal, and inner protective seal. For best results take one (1) capsules daily preferably with meals or as directed by your healthcare professional. Do not exceed the recommended dose. The bottle consist of fifty (50) capsules or fifty (50) servings per container.  My daughter deals with the annoyance of hyperacidity and burning stomach, and it's not an occasional occurrence but a chronic thing.  Usually she dealt with burning stomach or heartburn is to take antacids like Tums, Tagamet or Prilosec. All of these medications work by reducing the stomach acidity.  Tums contain alkaline ingredients like calcium carbonate that directly neutralizes the HCL acid in the stomach for a short period of time (because obviously then the stomach produces more). Tagamet and Zantac work by blocking the H2 histamine receptors, which regulate the acid production on the stomach. They provide a long lasting reduction in stomach acidity, because they lower the production of acid instead of acting on the acid itself. Prilosec and similar drugs belong to the class of the proton pump inhibitors, which again works by reducing the production of acid by the stomach, in a long lasting, and more aggressive way.  One problem that people (including often doctors) don't understand is that when people experience heartburn or burning stomach, it's often not caused by an actual excess of acidity in the stomach, but by a damage of the layer of mucus that protects the stomach lining. The stomach is designed to have a very high acidity, both to digest foods and to protect against pathogens that can be ingested with the food, because most are killed by the highly acidic environment of the stomach. Acids damage tissues so normally there is a layer of acid-resistant mucus that creates a buffer between the acid inside the stomach and the stomach itself. As long as this barrier is in place everything is good.  The mucus production, however, can be reduced by several different factors, like use of aspirin and similar NSAIDs, stress, steroid drugs, etc. If the protective mucus is reduced, the stomach lining will become vulnerable to the corrosive action of the stomach acids, which will create burning, pain, etc.  It seems clear that the best approach is to increase the production of protective mucus, rather than reducing the stomach acidity, yet all the official therapies focus on reducing the stomach acidity. This, by the way, is a terrible idea (unless it's a legitimate case of hyperclorridia or excessive stomach acid) because not only does it make you more vulnerable to food borne pathogens, but it can contribute to an overgrowth of H. Pylori, if that's already an issue for you. Helicobacter Pylori is a bacteria commonly found in the stomach that can overcolonize lead to stomach ulcers. H Pylori prevents a less acidic environment, and it can actually reduce the ph of the stomach acid. So, if you are taking anything to reduce stomach acid, you are actually doing H Pylori a favor, for which it will repay you with some excruciating ulcers.  Additionally, reducing stomach acid also impairs your digestion and assimilation of vitamins and nutrients. Vitamin B12, for instance, requires a certain acidity for it to be absorbed. Same thing for iron and many others.  The only thing that is known to increase the production of the protective stomach mucus is licorice, which DGL is made from. (By the way, I am talking about REAL licorice, not the fake &#34;licorice&#34; flavored candies that are actually flavored with anise and bear no resemblance to real licorice.).  So far she have not had any side effects. Her stomach has not bothered me. The licorice seems to be of good quality and there does not appear to be anything wrong with it. I would recommend it to others.  I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

290. poor quality item. Did not last as long as the ones that came with the mask. Seal broke within 2 months on 3 of them
291. Grandchildren love them. Nice product
292. Cooling Pillow LOL, its made of heavy plastic that makes your face sweat & sticks to your skin. It get hot with 5 minutes of use. Pillow case is sweaty & is itchy. It's the size of an ice pack for your knee, NOT a pillow, its tiny (see pic my hand is very small). The same "pillow" in black is sold as a testicle cooling pad for vasectomies by this seller.Gel balls are so noisy & move even when you breath, I used for 5 minutes, couldn't take the noise & had to peeled it off my face.IT'S NOT COOLING OR A PILLOW!!!
293. Bought to give away
294. They are helping especially with cramps.in my feet.
295. It does what is says it will do -removes hair painlessly.  It does take significant amount of time rubbing it in a circular motion to remove the hair, but it does eventually remove the hair and it does not hurt at all, unlike waxing or using an epilator.  Your skin is exfoliated in the process so it is really smooth afterwards.  I was able to do one half of my leg from the knee down, on the front, before my arm got too tired so I will do a little each day after my shower until it is all done.BONUS: it also works on facial hair that I normally get a wax treatment for.  I was looking at my lady lip hairs and it reminded me that I need to make an appointment for a wax treatment, then saw this device sitting on the bathroom counter and had a lightbulb moment…would this work on my little bit of random lip hair???  I had just washed my face so I gave it a try and it worked!  Again, the exfoliation left my skin feeling smooth and soft, and no little hairs needing to either be plucked or waxed.  Because of this along I have upgraded it from 4 stars to 5 stars, now I don’t need to schedule a wax appointment and have my upper lip swollen and red all day after the waxing like it usually is.  I had no irritation at all from this device.  Saying goodbye to my every couple of weeks painful waxing appointments!I had my doubts that it would work, or if it did remove the hair it would have my sensitive skin very irritated, but I was wrong on both parts.  It worked and my skin was not harmed at all.  Kind of a cool device. And cost less than a single waxing appointment too!
296. First, GERY company, try enclosing instructions with your product, or at least make the information available to consumers on the internet somewhere.  I have no idea what all of the attachments do, they appear to each have a unique purpose but I will never know what they are.  I had to search the internet to find out how to even use the device at all.Second, yes, it 'can' suck out a pimple, but it will leave an even uglier bruised looking place on your body where to removed it.  Don't use it on your face if you have anywhere in public to go the same day.  I only used on tip because I had no idea which tips and tools where for what purpose (again, instructions would have been nice).Third, this seems very unsanitary.  The zit contents, and blood, are sucked into the vacuum attachment and onto the sponge thing on the device.  It is difficult to clean it out or off.  I had to use straw brush to clean in the attachment and then I certainly didn't want to use it for cleaning straws after that, Gross.Honestly I don't know what I expected from this device but I can tell you that it does not work the way the video showed it working in the animated clip.  And unless you like little hickies I don't recommend it for people with sensitive or even mildly sensitive skin.I would not recommend this product to a friend.  Sorry Gery.
297. didn't bring back the black and remove scuff marks as well as I expected
298. As my husband and I get older, we are realizing why our parents would be so frustrated for the fact that hair is now growing in all the wrong places. My face has some unwanted hair and my husbands nose and ears are getting a few stragglers every now and then. This tool is rechargeable (so no need to worry about batteries!) and has many different attachments. It came packaged well. It cuts without being in danger of cutting skin, which is super important when trimming your nose or ears and can't really see what you're doing. Exactly what I expected the product to do
299. The nipple suckers do not work well at all, the syringe is not strong or long enough to get the suction needed for those with truly inverted nipples.The nipple correctors work but the surface area is way too large and definitely intended for someone with big nipples. If your nipples are smaller it’ll hurt a lot more than necessary.I’d only recommend the nipple correctors and only for those with large nipples. I’d say honestly to look for another brand myself I wasn’t too impressed.
300. I had WLS in 2013 and I absolutely have struggled so much getting enough of what I need. It's very difficult to manage. Usually I have to take a lot of vitamins to get all of what I should have and can't get as easily from food. This ultimately makes me nauseous. THESE ARE AWESOME. I only have to take one vitamin to get all of what I need (aside from iron) which is absolutely wonderful compared to what I was having to do. Not sure how I lived so long without these. Total game changer. These still can make me nauseous if I don't have them with food but that's likely due to just not having as big of a stomach so it's really not a big issue. If you have had WLS please grab these and don't try and manage the vitamins on your own, it's so much trouble when you could just take something literally made for your needs.

302. Comfortable and as advertised you can still hear everything just that really loud sounds are blocked and reduced in volume. I use them several days a week and have had no problems with them. Recommended.
303. I love how this feels on my face. It's really relaxing and it has Bluetooth. I connected it to my phone and relaxed and listened to my music. I has 4 massage modes, hot compress, and kneading massage. I didn't have any problem with the comfort, it felt good. It's also cheaper than the other ones I've seen.
304. It worked really great and you can see the screen very clearly. That's what got me was the brightness and clarity of the LED screen. I also like that it has usb-C and it comes with a bag too. Nice.
305. This little thing is a great shaver and trimmer. It does the job and it's really compact, which will be great for travel.
306. How did people clean walls before these? The magic part of the name is more accurate than anything I can think of.
307. Great to have in your stash especially if you have daughters! After the whole toilet paper shortage last Spring, I decided to get these to have on hand. Soft and well made.
308. Absolutely AMAZING!!! If you like “digging thumb deep” shoulder and neck rubs, you’ll love this. And it doesn’t get tired! :)
309. Love this stuff. Smells better than Aqua Reef and just like all of the other Old Spice gel deodorants it goes on smooth and lasts all day long. Recommend this to anyone who wants to smell great!
310. I'm a protein powder nut. I start off every day with a protein shake and I love trying new flavors and combinations of flavors to keep it from getting boring. Of all the proteins I've tried recently, this and the oatmeal cookie version from the same brand have been some of my favorites flavor wise! Oh. My. Word. Yum. I thought it would be like Nutela, but it actually has a bit of a nutty flavor along with the chocolate, which I really enjoyed. I seriously love the taste. It mixes smoothly and isn't gritty at all. My only complaint is that it's sweetened with sucralose. I'd prefer something a little more natural like stevia or monk fruit, but other than that, it's fantastic!
311. I'm a protein powder nut. I start off every day with a protein shake and I love trying new flavors and combinations of flavors to keep it from getting boring. Of all the proteins I've tried recently, this and the chocolate hazelnut version from the same brand have been some of my favorites flavor wise! Oh. My. Word. Yum. I seriously love the taste. It mixes smoothly and isn't gritty at all. My only complaint is that it's sweetened with sucralose. I'd prefer something a little more natural like stevia or monk fruit, but other than that, it's fantastic!
312. I start every day off with a nutrition packed protein smoothie. What I appreciate about this mix is that I don't feel like I have to add an additional superfoods powder to my smoothie because the ingredients are already to fantastic! I tried just blending it with ice cubes and coconut milk the first time I had it, but the flavor was a little bland and the pea protein left a chalky taste in my mouth so I added some cold brew coffee and a splash of coffee creamer and  then it tasted like I was drinking a delicious blended coffee! Yum! If you don't mind doing a little doctoring to mask the chalkiness this is a great option with squeaky clean ingredients!
313. I start off every day with a protein shake to get me going and stave off cravings until lunch. I prefer to use a protein that includes a superfood blend like this one. The ingredients in this mix are fantastic and it is exactly what I'm looking for to start the day off on the right foot. Unfortunately, like most proteins with pea protein as one of the main protein sources, it has kind of a chalky flavortexture. If you're used to using pea protein products, you know what I'm talking about. I wasn't wild about the flavor just on it's own. With a little tweaking though, it's not bad. I've found if you blend it into a smoothie using coffee that's been frozen into cubes with coconut milk and a splash of your favorite coffee creamer, it's actually pretty delicious and tastes like a frappe. The price is also pretty reasonable for a protein with ingredients this clean. I would order this again.
314. I'm a busy mom and don't always have time to fix a big nutritious meal... and yet I still want to be providing my body with powerhouse nutrients to keep me going through the day. This powder is the perfect solution for me on days when a pack of crackers I found shoved in the bottom of the diaper bag between errands is what's on the menu for "Lunch." You just mix a scoop of the powder with 8 ounces of your beverage of choice and that's it! You've got a powerful nutrient boost! I'm really impressed by the ingredients in this powder. It's full of all the good stuff and free from all the bad stuff. It's sweetened with monk fruit and isn't full of a bunch of added ingredients and dyes. Flavor wise, I thought it was pretty good. It has a very pleasant berrypomegranate flavor. It wasn't a chore to drink, although the hint of beets was a bit unsettling. I doubt most people would even notice the mild beet flavor, but I have a profound abhorrence of beets, so I'm uber sensitive to the flavor and can pick it up in things where most people wouldn't have a clue it was even there, so unless you loathe beets as much as I do, it's probably not a big deal. I only notice the beet flavor when mixed with straight water. If you make a smoothie using this powder, vanilla protein, a few frozen strawberries and coconut milk, It's absolutely delicious and I don't pick up on the beets at all. This product is definitely on the pricey side, but as with most things in life, you get what you pay for. I would order this again.
315. I'd never even heard of white noise machines before I became a parent, and now I'm practically a white noise hoarder. I have one in each of my kids rooms, a portable one for travel and one that gets left at Grandma's house in case I forget mine. Plus a couple extras, you know, in case one breaks. It's bad. I have a problem. But they're just so stinkin' soothing and they cover every squeak of the floor in my 100 year old house so I can sneak into my sleeping kids rooms without waking them up. Of all the white noise machines I've had, this one has the least annoying "bonus" sounds of all of them. I usually just use the various white noise settings, but on this one the nature sounds and music are actually really nice! I'm impressed! I wish there was a way to have it rotate through all the songs instead of play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" 500 times in a row, but other than that there's really nothing about this that I don't like. The light is soft and you can select the color of light you prefer or have it fade through the whole rainbow. A rechargeable battery would really knock this out of the park so I could have the option to use it without being plugged in, but it's not something I really need I guess. I would definitely recommend this to any new parent!
316. I wasn't sure what to expect of this protein powder. I've tried many different plant based proteins but never oat. I was a little confused on what the flavor was supposed to be... It looks like an oatmeal cream pie on the packaging, but says that the flavor is "Marshmallow." I wonder if it's supposed to be a marshmallow filled oatmeal cream pie? The packaging should really be updated to be less confusing. This definitely tastes nothing like a marshmallow, but it does taste like an oatmeal cream pie! I was actually pretty impressed by the flavor! I blended it into a smoothie with frozen coffee cubes, coconut milk and a splash of my favorite coffee creamer and it tasted like an oatmeal cream pie frappuccino! It was so delicious that my 3 year old kept trying to steal it, so I made her a coffee free version and she loved it. I really appreciate that this is sweetened with more natural sweeteners. That's a big deal to me when I'm shopping for protein powder. Other than the confusion as to what flavor this is actually supposed to be, I'm happy with it and would order this again.
317. Collagen is a fantastic supplement for so many reasons! It's great for your hair, skin, nails, gut, immune system, and more! This powder is super easy to incorporate into your diet. My favorite way to take it is to blend it into my morning protein smoothie. It virtually disappears and you'd have no idea it was even there. You can also add it to both hot and cold drinks, sprinkle it on your yogurt, add it to soup, bake with it, etc... It's super easy to sneak into almost anything. This powder is nice and fine and seems to be nice quality. This is a little more expensive than other varieties I've seen though. Usually you can get a 1lb tub of collagen powder for about the same price as this and this is only 10 ounces, so it's not the best deal, but it does seem to be good quality.
318. These are basically candy... With a small amount of elderberry and vitamin c. The dosage of elderberry is quite low and they are pretty much straight sugar. They also don't look anything like the picture and are coated in sugar. They definitely are delicious, but if you want something with a higher amount of elderberry and lower amount of sugar I'd probably get something else.
319. These are nice, easy to swallow little pills. They are quite small so even people who struggle to swallow pills shouldn't have too much trouble with them. I appreciate the fact that these are made with coconut oil to aid absorption. I've been trying to increase my vitamin D levels after several doctors have come out with studies suggesting that people with higher levels of vitamin D tend to not get as sick if they catch Covid-19. It's not going to hurt anything so it's definitely worth a try! I live in the mid-west where the winters can be pretty brutal, so I don't get outside much, as a result my vitamin D levels aren't as high as they could be. My only disappointment is that after I ordered these vitamins I found a bottle that has an entire years worth of vitmain D in the same dosage, same small pills, also liposomal and also made with coconut oil, but it was an entire years worth for only a couple dollars more, so these definitely aren't the best deal out there.
320. I've recently discovered the wonders of gel manicures! No drying time and they last for weeks? Sign me up! I love the colors included in this set! They are very vibrant and bright! The colors go on fairly thin so it takes a couple of coats to get good coverage. The glitter polish is a bit on the chunky side, which is pretty, but rather hard to get it to look even. The polish arrived nicely packaged in a box with foam to hold it in place and a color dot on top of each bottle to quickly identify the colors since gel polish arrives in black bottles. I'm happy with it so far and would order this again.
321. I’m a busy mom of two small children, which means I’m on my feet a lot pretty much all day. When I actually get a few minutes to myself, I’ve been really enjoying this foot massager! It has variable speeds and pressure as well as heat that really help my feet feel relaxed. I feel like it’s a little rough on my heels, and I wish I could turn that part off once it gets uncomfortable, but the disc that massages the arches and the balls of the feet feels good. The part that goes over your feet inflates to squeeze your feet kind of like a blood pressure cuff, and pushes your feet down onto the massager so you get a deep massage on the bottoms of your feet. It comes in a nice box, and would be a great gift.
322. What’s better than a piña colada? A piña colada the packs a powerful protein punch! I definitely give this drink mix five stars for flavor. It doesn’t taste at all like traditional whey protein powder, it seriously does just taste like you’re drinking a piña colada. Blend  it with some ice and coconut milk and you are good to go. Before ordering it, I scoured the product information page but I couldn’t find a list of ingredients listing the sweetener. I am fairly particular about what sweeteners I use, but decided to take a chance, since I love Piña colada, even though I didn’t see where the sweetener was listed. I was disappointed when it arrived and saw that uses sucralose, which tends to make me feel sick. I will probably not be finishing this due to that fact, despite the delicious flavor. The “Ingredients” List on the Amazon page literally just says “Whey protein isolate.” This should definitely be updated, so that people can make an informed decision about what they’re putting into their bodies. If you don’t mind sucralose, this is a delicious protein powder for sure.
323. I love the massive amount of time turmeric in these capsules! Turmeric is a wonderful, all natural, anti-inflammatory, joint pain fighting machine! Most brands that I’ve looked at have under 1000 mg per serving. But I was looking for a product that packed a bit more of a punch and this product was the winner! Each serving of 3 veggie capsules contains over 2000 mg of turmeric as well as black pepper for maximum absorption. It’s organic and each bottle contains a months worth of capsules.
324. When I first opened the container of gummies I was expecting to smell something light and citrus-y. Instead I was met with a very strong odor that smells like a combination of plastic and cleaning supplies. It's quite strong. Despite the rather scary aroma, I tried one anyway, and they are quite delicious, I'm just a bit put off by the smell.
325. The medium worked for my smallish man's arm.  Good quality and it should last.  Use it before you need it for best results.
326. Product packaging was poor, with no protection for a thin box. Product itself seems to be undamaged. Quality of product is fine.
327. Great Item at a great price, thank you!
328. My mom raved about the old fashioned Norelco electric razors, but I'd never tried one quite like it. This 5-head razor gives me the closest shave ever! Where has it been all my life? Usually my electric razors are good in a pinch, but they always make look like I have 1-2 days growth. This shaver is different. It's just as close as a manual razor. My legs and underarms are just as smooth as if I've just whipped out the shaving cream and straight razor. I also love how the five heads are put together in natural curves to complement the human body. It's as if this was custom designed to fit over my knee caps - and how many electric shavers can actually get the knees smooth? Up and down, or around in circles, this safe razor will never hurt you.As an awesome bonus, this razor comes with several attachments. (To change attachments, and to clean it, read the manual and have some faith that pushing and pulling won't break the device.) I've tried the trimmer with the three levels of attachments, and it's not barber-quality but it's good enough in a pinch. The facial massage and scrubber are really nice. The dry brush massage is so gentle, and the soft plastic scrubber really adds an extra oomph to my cleanser. Thankfully, I haven't had to use the nose hair clippers, so I can't report on the effectiveness.It also comes with a little brush to clean under the heads (again, read the manual), and a small bottle of oil so you can replenish the lubrication. My device came pre-lubricated, which was nice. It's easy to hold, quick and easy to charge in a USB port (cord included), and the electric display shows how much time is left before you need to recharge. It is not waterproof, though, so don't take it into the bath. Dry off and use it after.
329. pretty much useless. i got it for cats. they're freaks to begin with and have to be on prozac, so i bought this anticipating trouble. this was not helpful. as an alternative, i also purchased those treat things that you shove the pill in, and although they needed some coaxing & praise, the cats now gobble their pills eagerly every day! success.
330. Puffs are very low quality. Thin and not nearly as soft as other lotion tissue. The price was not much different, so I feel the value is low. Buy Kleenex or one of many store brands that are far better quality.
331. These are definitely heavy duty clippers! I got them for my husband because he said his clippers were not doing the job well anymore. He told me to get a better quality clipper so I researched for a little while and saw these with good reviews. My husband said they scared him on the first clip he did! hahahahaha  I think these could cut metal if you tried it. LOL
332. It said in the description that it would fit most cleaning wands.  Well, I have two different ones and it doesn't. Now I can't return it to Amazon because it says the window of time to return is too late. But I didn't need to replace it till now and when I tried to put it on the one I have,  it doesn't fit!!
333. Just got it.  Doesn't turn on.
334. Not good at all
335. Best sleep aid on the market.
336. If you have small feet, these are still too big even though they say they are for children.  I have a 5 narrow and these are too big.
337. Purchased several times. Does not bother our stomachs.
338. These were better than nothing but not that great. There was not a lot of lathering. One major problem is you have to make sure your hands are dry when you go to pick one of the sheets up. If not, you got a bunch all at one time. I was hoping this was going to be the answer when traveling, but it was probably a one time purchase. Regular bar of soap did better for us.
339. 3.5 stars. These were bough as an emergency fix and worked in a pinch, but the hand rests are NOT palm friendly and were very uncomfortable for my son. People who use forearm crutches all the time need curved hand rests for comfort. These were inexpensive and quick delivery.
340. These say that they're new and OEM, but they cut like they've been poorly refurbished.  Not impressed, and will not buy again.
341. Got a new pair of dress boots I love, except that the heels don't have a good grip and I didn't feel comfortable walking on tile or slick hardwood. These took care of it.They are shaped for toes, but I needed it for the heel so I used scissors to cut to fit which was easy enough.  I thought that since the fit wasn't exact they might have a tendency to peel off, but I've worn the boots several times the these grips are still stuck tight.  I imagine they will eventually peel, but for the price I'm willing to replace once or twice a season if necessary.I was also worried that they might be too rough me to want to wear on our nicely finished floors, but they seem ok.Downside, they took a LONG time to be delivered, like over three weeks.  Buy before the season starts!
342. I have tried just about every type of powder and potion available to help control my recurring "jock itch" and extreme sweating.  This is the first one that truly helped me.  I HATE anything with menthol.  I guess it's my skin or maybe because of the irritation I get from chafing, but mentholated products really BURN my balls!!  I don't even like putting that stuff on my back (which sweats insanely) or anyplace else on my body.  Thank God these guys have an Unscented formula of this powder that doesn't have menthol in it or anything else my skin reacts to sensitively.  Just please promise me you guys won't add menthol to your unscented powder!!  I think it's in the other two scents you make, and I know loads of guys like that "cooling" sensation - but this guy can't take the BURN.  Thanks again for an excellent product.  The three pack is a great deal plus I like knowing proceeds go to fight testicular cancer as I've known two guys who had it - one was my uncle and I don't want to think of anybody going through what he endured.
343. With all the growth in technology, I'm not sure how optimum's stuff still tastes bad. Very chalky and bitter.
344. I like the oval shape, it’s good for working in between the scapula and spine.
345. This works like a dream. Simple, perfect curls. But there is a huge problem. It doesn't stay charged to curl your whole head. I got a little over halfway done and the battery died. It was only on for about 20 minutes. Who has time to stop and recharge halfway through styling?? So sad because it works great but the battery dying is unacceptable.
346. These are so pretty and exactly what I wanted.
347. got exactly what I was expecting
348.  Cute nail trimmer. Gets the job done
349. I love this towel! The picture is great, and the towel is awesome for the beach or pool. It's a little smaller than most beach towels, but it works great for me!
350. This is the biggest piece oh shiiiiiiii I ever bought ! It does not even work
351. I love that these are so lightweight and that they have a flexible frame.  These are great, I'm not kidding!  I was skeptical about ordering online glasses, but these are such good quality lenses that they don't just work for upclose, they work great for that 2 to 3 foot range for working on my computer too.Update:  I just ordered two more pairs!
352. I purchased this for my fiance and got a size large as he is a smaller framed male. I honestly should have just gotten the XL. He says it works but chafes under the armpits after a while so he can only wear it short term. All in all a good product but definitely suggest a size up from what youd normally wear.
353. Small and perfect box size for friends if you're looking for something simple.
354.  I have to take gummy supplements due to pills irritating my stomach. These taste like prunes, smell like sweet mushrooms so the flavor is offputting but not bad.
355. Love the bleach tablets! Though expensive for only 40, they have helped with my asthma. I can't breathe in the bleach fumes and this is a way of preventing it! And they are easy to use and work!
356. Durable and better than most silicon scrubbers. Must have if you struggle with psoriasis, eczema, or alopecia. My psoriasis is lessened in appearance and with much shorter shower times and products.
357. The description says (copied & pasted)  "Including: Cleaning supplies, including 1 sanitary stick, 1 storage bucket and 10 disposable sanitary stick refills". The title didn't say it but I bought this based on the description. This is useless as is. It won't work with a Clorox wand. Plus, I didn't know it was being mailed from China. Guess I didn't read the description well enough. Returning asap.
358. Nice sturdy brush, bristles are are not too soft, just right. Bought to replace another I ordered that was much too soft. It could be just a tad longer, but it does reach all of my back, so does the Job.
359. Not great direction on how to specifically use, had to YouTube it, got stuck in hair a few times that hurt and tied a not, but after YouTube,  I was able to figure it out. Battery doesn't stayed charged for 60 mins as stated: did 6 strands and 50% battery down.  Why don't products with USB cords come with outlet plug-ins? Can't do my half head without it dying, not worth buying only if u have shirt thin hair.
360. I bought this product but it did not fit my massage table. The return policy said it could be returned or replaced. However, I tried returning and it says not returnable. I am now stuck with pricey, unusable pad.
361. I was a little nervous ordering these because some reviewers noted they are small.  For the price, I decided to give them a try and if they were too small my teen daughter could wear them.  Glad I ordered because they fit great!  The seam down the center also helps prevent breathing in your mask while talking and breathing.  I wish I ordered these sooner!
362. The best quality potassium I've ever bought!! Great product!
363. I had high hopes but really unimpressed with this product. I feel i get a better effect with dollar store triple antiobiotic ointment.
364. This is the best value for rope style cotton for vaping using rebuildable atomizers on amazon.
365. This doesnt smell as strong as some others but it is a large quantity of eucalyptus oil for the price
366. Very nice. Worth the money
367. With Covid eyeglasses all fogged up we purchased this.  It kind of works.  The process to cleanapply is much different than regular eyeglass cleaner and you spray, smear it around until dry, and then wipe any streaks off.  The glass still fogged up from breathing but much less than untreated lenses.  Will keep and try again until I can figure this stuff out.
368. We bought these because they came packaged 10 per bag rather than one bag of 100.  Much easier to use and the packaging doesn't expose the whole lot each time you retrieve a few for use.
369. These were too big for my needs. I returned them.
370. Like the product but way to much money for a piece of plastic.
371. Because of health issues I have to be very conscious of getting enough protein and THIS product is great to use in many ways. I have concocted a frozen mixture which I keep on hand at all times...this protein boosts the grams and also boosts the flavoring!! My favorite.
372. Bought these files as a birthday present for a friend. They come in a nice, black velvet sleeve. I like having a small and large file.  They are very pretty with the colored glass.
373. They are nice bags. I am using them in my litter genie.  They are much less expensive than the refills and are just as good to hold kitty poo.  I will buy again
374. Very inaccurate readings. Do not buy. Waste of money
375. I like this mask. While a gaiter is my favorite, there are times when gaiters are not appropriate or it is too hot to use them.  My biggest complaint about masks, besides my glasses fogging, are feeling like the straps are going to pull my ears off.  Then the third most annoying thing is where do you put them when they are not on.  I used my center console in my car for a while, but that just means 80% of the time I was walking back to my car when I remembered that I needed a mask. I thought about my pocket, but don’t really want to breathe through pocket litter residue.  It wasn’t until I saw a football game and the coaching staff had masks with a “croakie” for lack of a better term.  Because I do have a large head, I bought the XL’s.The way this mask works is that the neck and ear pieces are connected.  The mask and keeper can be pulled over any head or hair style without a lot of fuss.  Then when you are ready to put the mask on you grab the keeper and get some slack which goes behind the ears, tug the keeper til it’s tight and mask is in place.In all this mask, has the tapered cut at the nose and plenty of coverage.  If there is one flaw it is that it never seems tight enough.  It doesn’t fall off or anything, but it feels like it might.  While this is slightly annoying, have the mask hanging around your neck, always ready to use makes up for the fit.  If you wear glasses, there is enough fabric that you can bring it up over your nose and then let your glasses sit on the fabric.  This does two things- eliminates fogging and helps you feel like the mask is snug.If you have a large head, can’t keep up with or forget your mask, then I highly recommend this style of mask.  I have not tried others like this, so the 4 may be unfair.  I just think the construction could be improved upon slightly and make the perfect mask - if there is such a thing.
376. How come every time you find a cleaning product you really like when you go back to buy it again it becomes a mission.  This is one such product.  Many years ago I discovered the saving that could be had buying bulkconcentrated cleaning products.  From orange cleaner to Murphy’s oil soap the saving is staggering. So when this product first came out I jumped on it.  And have been using it ever since.  Thankfully I had bout an additional bottle to see which scent I preferred way back when because now this product isn’t at Walmart, Kroger, Lowe’s, etc in our area.  Thankfully amazon is there to deliver the Items that cannot be found.Who knows what lengths I will have to go to in a few years but that is tomorrow’s problem.Great cleaner, fresh scent.  I usually have a double strength bottle and a regular bottle.  The cleaner is very good and takes most of the work out of it after it soaks in.
377. Attempted to install holder onto Holder.  Clips on both sides broke off.  Made of hard plastic and have no give.  Commode piping needs to be smaller than toilet holder.
378. The texture is just right; not too much hard beeswax or too much soft olive oil.The price is reasonable compared with the big name brand.The taste of olive oil is ok & I'd rather have that than petro-chemicals on my lips.I'm not happy that the use-by date is only 2 months after the date my order came.So all the unused tubes will have to be stored in the refrigerator or freezer door until needed.
379. I bought similar screens before and they were poorly stamped out of the screen and they were much thinner.  These screens seem to last longer too.
380. My doctor recommended these and a I’ve been taking them for a couple of years. GNC has great items at reasonable prices. I recommend!
381. Capella Flavor Drops Gingerbread Concentrate-For  a flavoring it taste so-so.  Has a slightly artificial under taste.  Nice smell. I added to my coffee and food. It sort of tastes like it has ginger in it but only semi-convincing. Weak flavor.  Not terrible but not good.  Bitter is not the problem.  Ginger tends to be a little bitter but the flavor is not balanced properly.  Will finish bottle because it not it's awful but will not buy again.
382. Excellent product and a really great value.
383. Great way to curb an appetite...really love it.
384. I was a little worried about sizing because I'm larger - but it fits great and is really easy to adjust. Definitely helps me not to slouch without being uncomfortable. I've noticed a big improvement in my back pain since I started using it.
385. I had a cross made of silver and it was completely black from tarnishing, I follow the directions and dip it in the solution for just a few seconds when It came out I wiped it and wonderful. Great product highly recommend .
386. Lightweight soft.  I like these.  Great value.
387. Really great for getting hard water stains out of the toilet bowl. It's the only thing that removes hard water buildup from our toilets.
388. Great after my foot surgery. Makes a difference
389. It looks good but it was a pain to put together. I should have read the description I didn’t realize I had to put it together.
390. i don't really have anything to compare this to, my first foray into protein powders, i wanted something simple, no funky chemical engineering or mystery ingredients. this fit the bill.
391. This is my second time ordering these, they work great for me - I like to pack light, so I bring these and a few large ziplock bags, I throw a couple of strips in a bag filled with water, let the strip dissolve, then add my shirt, or swimsuit, or whatever, I can agitate and rinse or let sit overnight in the bag to soak.
392. Exactly what I expected.
393. I buy these for myself, not kids, I love them.
394. Use this a few times a week on a bichon and it keeps her eyes bright and clean
395. Bounty is about as good for a fraction of the price.
396. These are a bit smaller than I thought they'd be but they do adhere well and relieve pain. You seriously forget you are wearing them, they are that comfortable. Much nicer to wear for any length of time than the gel patches. When it takes 2 to cover an area though that makes them quite expensive.
397. This got the job done, but if you try to move it around under your desk with your feet, it will collapse. There are places where the metal stick (not rod- it's not that sturdy) are supposed to click into slots, but the slots are too big so it doesn't stay in place when you move it. This is way too cheap to cost nearly $100.
398. Pills tend to get stuck in there so have to do it a couple times at times and my cat not super happy but I like the small design with the loops for more control and if I can get the pill to go first time it’s perfect!
399. Really a necessity for a scooter!
400. I liked the effect from these CorneaCare Rescue: Self Cooling Hydrogel Cold Compress Eye Cooling Pads. Personally I preferred the cooling effect after putting them Eye Cooling pads in the fridge before using but I found them to be very helpful with my dry eyes and puffy eyes from allergies.
401. This book’s been so helpful for learning more about pressure points and how they can help with pain relief! I’d definitely recommend reading it to others.
402. I’ve been happy with how well this has been working for me. I would recommend this to others!
403. I had trouble with this using product.  I’m on the fence about recommending it to others.
404. As advertised, good product, good vendor.
405. As advertised.
406. Product used for dryness of eyes.
407. I started using this to prevent a biofilm from developing. The jury is still out as to if it does that, but it makes me feel better. So I give it 2 thumbs up.
408. This little tens unit has been a godsend. My back has been killing me and I ordered myself one of these and by day 2 of using it. I have no more Pain. It is super reasonable in price its made  very well.and easy to use. Make sure you get 3 AAA batteries for it too.
409. This remedy comes in an easy dose tube just turn upside down turn the top the pellets drop down. Good for my restless legs with cramping. Good value for the money.
410. This has been a life saver,  I can't say enough good things.
411. It's natural,great for scalp
412. The cloths comes off the holder. Too much trouble to use,
413. Very comfortable and relievers pressure from hips and lower back
414. good size but a bit pricey for a sponge.  OK if it holds up as my former one did.
415. This is not worth the money. Far too small to fit even the basic first aid essentials.
416. I like the value of getting ten boxes at once. And you can’t go wrong with puffs!
417. The perfect size wedge. I use it in my bed
418. I thought it would open to clip on back of shoe but it doesn't.  You have to slide it on and if your shoe isn't really stiff, it's very difficult to get on. Also, the handle is too short making it more difficult to reach and remove once you get your foot in the shoe. My long handle shoe horn works much better.
419. He got me to try it. He says my moods are improved. It. DEFINITELY adds marital spice for us both. Try it for that reason if nothing else.Hubby also takes other things from the Isagenix line and has lost weight.The only concern is price.
420. I didn't feel difference using these and for the cost I don't recommend.
421. These wipes are barely suitable for use. They are tiny and dry. They barely remove dirt. I guess you get what you pay for.
422. I have been using this product for years and it surely does what it says it does! I use this item daily as I have sore gums & wear dentures & I must say that Benzodent does the trick.
423. Blue Emu cream really helps your feet! It is a fair price for the wonderful results! Trust me, my feet are so painful & this works!!
424. Fine lotion for dry skin & works very well on all parts of our bodies.
425. Greatest pot holder ever!  Love the colors available.
426. These are posted & listed with "33% more loads" with 66 as total.  I received 2 of the regular size with 25 loads (50 total loads).  Please correct the listing to reflect the normal size bottles.
427. The bristles are not too stiff and provide a good scrubbing especially for your feet.  I would have given these a 5 star rating if the handles were a few inches longer.  They may be just perfect for anyone less than 5' 5&#34; in height.
428. These Innocheer 24&#34; Wind Chimes with S Hook are literally music to my ears. I love the sound that they make. I moved them earlier today on my front porch so that they would be closer to my bedroom. They sound like Christmas music to me and such a pretty sound at that.I would buy again.
429. Cute packaging with overstuffed mesh bags and very fine mesh material causing spills everywhere.
430. I bought these for my husband. He wears a mask as work and it was hurting his ears. These did the trick! He said it's just what he needed.
431. This is the first true medical kit I have ever purchased. I purchased it at the start of the coved pandemic because I had seniors to take care of at home. This is one of the most complete med sets I have ever seen. It’s great. There’s so many supplies I almost can’t get it all in the backpack. The backpack is made well and can be used for outdoors. However, the fabric is not completely waterproof. With much gratitude, thank you, and hope this helps others. :DPros:1) A comprehensive set of supplies2) Quality products3) Well packaged4) The backpack is good quality material and well builtCons:1) No instructions on which items are best put together in the backpack2) Backpack not completely waterproof
432. This airway tube is a great addition to a first aid or trauma kit. But one needs to be trained how to use it. In addition, the tube has an close expiration date. It comes in a sterile bag and made of medical grade plastic.
433. Slow results. Strong chemicals.
434. This is a good product. The results were reliable. However, this combo product had difficulty in terms of the results being automatically put online. I had to call to have the company send me an electronic version of the results. They were very professional and knew the technical details of I needed explanation.
435. This is a cute sugar bowl. Doesn’t take up much space but looks pretty good. The spoon is small but just the right size.
436. Sticky enough to stay and enough to be kind in removing.
437. I have very sensitive skin and I often blow my nose. I did a bit too much it and my nose got infected the other day.It was the first time of my life that type of itchy and burning sensation in my nose and I was very upset about it. I was trying not to touch my nose but did not heal at all in few days, I decided to try some treatment and found this product. I felt so much better already, right after I apply it first time. I'm so glad I used it!!!
438. top came unglued.
439. Will be returning!! Does not fit my toothbrush even though my model was listed and now i cannot remove the head. Not happy!!!
440. I only give this product 4 stars because it has to be something that really blows my socks off to get all 5 stars. I've been using this product for a  few years and I am happy with it. It is marketed for the body builders but this is not why I take them. I have been diagnosed with Maj. Depression and have been looking for alternatives and holistic methods of treating it rather than pharmaceutical psych meds. After taking a college course on genetics which taught me how the body uses DNA, amino acids, and proteins and where they came from I decided to supplement my lunch bag on the go diet (I'm a working student) with amino acids. I noticed a difference in my depression levels after about one month and the improvement has been sustained for a little over three years wo the unwanted side effects of psych meds. I have looked but have been unable to find any good research on the use of amino acids to treat mental illness or possible side effects to taking large doses long term. With other life management  practices including outdoor cardio I have found this product very helpful with treating my depression.As far as building muscles, I can't really say. I do go to gym 4x days a week and perform 30 min of cardio and 30-45min resistance training and I mountain bike 2x weekly. I don't exercise to get big. I hit the gym to be a better biker and to manage weight gain. I also use other diet supplements. I used these for depression before the exercise routine. Since beginning exercise routine along with proper diet I have notice a difference in the gym but this can also be greatly due to technique. If your going for big I suppose they would work as well as any other protein product. The product I  like better though is Athlean-Rx. IT's a product produced by a guy name Jeff Cavalier who used to be the strength coach for the New York Mets. You can check out his web site at www.Athleen-x.com or look for him on YouTube.
441. Wow!! I am super impressed with this shaver. It works effectively to shave off my quarantine fur. It was easy to use & was fully charged upon receipt. I would definitely recommend this shaver to all!
442. This toothbrush is powerful to be so small, it gets them very clean! However, it is very compact for traveling so doesn't need mush space... I highly recommend for kids too.  : )
443. This product is great! Better than any other heating pad I have ever purchased. It is soft and heats my whole back and shoulders. It is a must have item!!!
444. My boys love the taste of these probiotics and I love that they keep them healthy, regular and are sugar free! Total mom win in my book!!
445. I have to say I tried to like this flavoring. I have gotten 7 different flavors. I tried them in baking mostly. I found that you needed a lot to even make it taste like anything (I found an unpleasant aftertaste).I honestly can not recommend this brand of flavoring. Amazon customerservice is great but this company Capella  has not responded to my emails. Their customer service is terrible if you have problems. Maybe someone else would think these are great but I am not one of them.Thank you and God bless you.
446. Exactly what I wanted and expected. You do have to string it together yourself but that's not a big deal it comes with the string you need.
447. Beautiful gilding flakes with the color of fall. Will look great on any project.
448. I have tried many Jojoba Oils and this one is bar far the best.  Helped with discoloration on my arm.  The packaging was very good and delivery was sooner than expected.  Have recommended this oil to my friends.
449. It is almost impossible to push the plunger. I thought it was one can so ordered a couple more. The same thing, HOW in the world can a company sell something like this? Gold Bond, I mean, not Amazon. And yes I twisted the cap and had other people try it.
450. Omg maybe I've just lived a sheltered life but I had no idea that you could actually get those crazy water rings out of the toilet! Def a secret weapon in my cleaning bin!
451. Was hesitant to buy cordless, as my other cordless (esp. for cats) didn't cut through mats easily.  By the time I pulled his hair 2 or 3 times he bit showing his irritation...and then I was irritated too.  This Holdog cordless Pet Hair Clipper came today and my cat was been quickly dematted.  It had a 60% charge and I waited a couple minutes to get 100% (charged very quickly).  I LOVE the LCD display.  The blade was easy to take off and reassemble, so I oiled and cleaned the clipper before and after use.  This time I got a kitty kiss.  We are both happy. Love it.  And for the price, amazing.
452. I need to be in a boot for several years.  The biggest complaint about wearing a boot (aside from the fact that you have to be in the darned boot) is that the velcro on the boot snags on literally everything!  It's ruined many pairs of pants and almost all of my leggings!  I bought this cover in hopes that it would solve this problem.  Once I put  the cover on; behold!  No more snags!  Woo hoo!  Threre is only one very minor problem that I've had with the cover.  Sometimes the zipper slides down.  A safety pin underneath the pull tab prevents this from happening. (I deducted one star for this)  The cover in my estimation, is relatively high priced to have a zipper that won't stay up.  On the other hand, this cover is literally a necessity to me.  It would be really nice if the covers were packaged with the boots.This cover is actually preventing me from ruining any more clothes, therefore saving me more than the cost of the cover.  I will be ordering another cover soon.Have a very blessed day!
453. These are ok. Didn't provide a ton of warmth but are comfortable.
454. Came exactly as advertised. Bought this for my horse's temporary health issues but ended up not needing it. Unfortunately I could not return it (even though it is still completely wrapped and unopened) so I donated it to a local veterinary office instead.
455. I love this product, totally recommend to anyone. Will purchase again.
456. Awful, watery "lotion*. It was supposed to be a lotion, not water???Also, keeps 0 bugs abay. Gave me skin rash.  Don't even bother.
457. I do volunteer work where we do free dental work  and i bought these to include in a post procedure  package. Wverythung was perfect and im very happy these were cheap enough that we can continue to buy and provide our service at low cost.  Good product.
458. Not good will not hole
459. Works well for massaging lotion or whatever cream you want to use.... I find the roller isn't as easy or feel as comfortable while using it.
460. It seemed to work really good at first but then the next day the urine smell came back a little. But it has still been better than other products.
461. It works as advertised. Thumbs up!
462. Works for my brush and super soft.
463. Perfect aroma !!!
464. All is well with this item. I need it to be in liquid form. I don’t know the best way to keep it liquid.  I purchased before and it was liquid. Smells great.
465. Quality is above what I expected. Price is great!
466. Very soft bristles but does not spin only vibrates. Actual Clarisonic heads spun back and forth as well so very disappointing.
467. magnets feel out after a few weeks but did help the soles
468. magnets feel out after a few weeks but did help the soles
469. the only product does not still to stones in shower
470. This toner essence is thicker than my first essence I love from Japan. It feels really nice and soothing when applied.  I've noticed a difference in my overall skin hydration and I've only been using it a week. I have oily but sensative skin that is prone to breakouts and it has done nothing but calm my skin.
471. Works better than any aluminum and baking soda free deodorant! Not one time has body odor peeked through. Even after 24 hour.
472. The laundry soap made my clothes smell great but overall too expensive
473. We needed this little battery for our security system.  Could not find it anywhere.  Price is reasonable and I will be reordering more soon.  If anyone needed this type of battery I would recommend this Panasonic as it does last very long!  We also changed out the battery in our fire alarms as it is very important to make sure your fire alarms are working for your safety!
474.  I’m learning At home beauty regimens to a health skin have beautiful skins and great scalp. I’m so happy I got this. You can use the comb part to help with circulation to the scalp I cannot wait to use it often.This devicehelps reduce blemishesassists in removing dark spotsreduces blackheads and large poresperfect for any skin complexionboosts cell metabolism byamplifying ATP production that helpsin slowing down skin aging
475.  They hair dryer came securely packaged it can with a cute velvet travel size bag, It is a digital blow dryer so you can control the temperature on the dryer.this hair dryer is lightweight, it’s like I’m not holding anything when I use the dryer to blow out my wigs. the color of the dryer had my attention.It comes with two attachment a smooth nozzle and diffuser, the power of the blow dryer drys in no time. I definitely recommend this seller
476. The bath sponges came safely secured tightly sealed there was no air in the package. The sponges are a decent size large enough for my son's body four came in a pack, he is super happy to have these sponges.
477. This brace is comfortable, and it fits into my lace up tennis shoes or work shoes. It stabilizes the ankle and lifts the toe, which prevents falls.I have ordered 3 braces, and this is the best.I gave a 4 star rating, only because the strap from the toe to the ankle was not holding after 5 weeks or so.The company is sending me a replacement at no charge. Great customer service!Update- I changed my review to a 5 star, because the company sent a new brace, not just the strap.Excellent customer service!
478. Use dish soap same thing
479. Cool product to have In The California area makes my friends jealous...
480. The opening isn't as wide as expected.  I would look elsewhere if you are looking for a toenail cutter for thick nails.  I will have to keep looking.
481. good value for price
482. I love the taste, its very good
483. Easy to use and it really does squeeze all the dirty liquid from the pad so you're not mopping with a completely dirty pad.
484. Great product!
485. These glasses are made for hardcore use.I have a ten year old son. Oh my lord what a kid, has the energy of five of them, never quiet, never standing still, allways moving, running, jumping, skating, baseball. Really? What is happening with this kid. These glasses have passed all tests, the only one missing is fire (and i really dont think it can survive that), but really satisfied with Miraflex.This is the second pair of glasses, the first one got lost as my kid didnt have glasses before he lost then the next month of purchase, so it doesnt count for me.Really, buy with confidence
486. Lots of fun!
487. I use this to make a Muesli for breakfast. I like that it's organic.
488. A classic formula for treating damp heat.
489. Strong electric motor. Quality construction. Works very well.
490. The only problem I have is with the top, and the fact it doesn't have a specific tip for pouring it.
491. This is perfect for anyone looking to organize their daily and nightly medications. Well worth buying.
492. These are a snap to get on and easy to clean!
493. first it caught my eyes because the price range is attractive, but after use found out water leaks slowly from the side. Not sure if it is defect only from this particular product or in general. Otherwise the outlook is cute and we absolutely love it
494. Arrived crammed into a box about the size containing 20 bags of tea. To cram it in there the tubing is bent and kinked. Bent rubber cracked and will not hold air. Returned.
495. My work requires a lot of hand washing (and hand wringing!). But, I need an accurate watch not connected to my arm that I can check often. This is marvelous. The watch hangs from the lanyard when I need to measure time, or tucks into my shirt pocket when I do not. The watch is accurate, and seems rugged enough to last.
496. Seems to be working and I am not having the jitters or clenching my teeth. I like the fact you can step off and not crash
497. love this, its'  all natural, its lasts a very long time, have found a way to make this to save money
498. Love this pocket guide. Great information.
499. I don’t know what it is but it seems like he is not real I don’t like it
500. THIS WAS A GREAT PARTY PACK, AND A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY.  WOULD CERTAINLY ORDER AGAIN FOR NEXT YEAR.
501. Works as described
502. I have read that glyconutrient therapy helps punch up the immune system to ward off viruses. I am all for this and was also looking for a supplement that will help level out our blood sugars. Since taking this product I can't say that it is a miracle drug of some kind, but can say that my blood sugars have remained normal (when before they would periodically read high) and I have not come down with a cold or flu (knock on wood). So, is it working ? I'd have to say so. It's kind of like &#34;Elephant Repellant&#34;. If you spray some around and never see an elephant.... is it working ?
503. As you would expect. Works great for stirring
504. I went to Vegas a week ago and was told to carry an Amethyst for Luck.  This was told to me by one of those fortune telling machines that spits out a card.  The amazing thing is, I am an Aquarius so amethyst is my lucky stone.  I ordered this stone not knowing what to expect.  When it came, I was stunned at the beauty of the packaging and the positive energy flowing from the product.The stone is gorgeous and has so much positive auras flowing through it as I held it.  It is a big stone that fits perfectly into my palm. I love how it feels and how it makes me feel.  I have noticed that I am more calm and more in tuned with my intuition.  Whenever I am upset or feel out of balance, I hold the stone and everything is fine with the world again.  In addition to, I feel like it is my lucky stone.I am glad that I ordered two stones. One for myself and one for my sister who is also an Aquarius.What sets this stone apart is the vibrational energy.  I have ordered stones from e-bay before and none of them gave me as much positive vibes as these stones.  I am so happy to have finally found someone who is selling REAL stones with POSITIVE energy.By the way, I bought a lottery ticket and won the mega ball.  Although it wasn't the $207 Million dollar prize, it's a start :)  I believe the stone is just warming up with with luck!
505. Not sure if it works yet but one of the two bottles doesn't even spray.
506. I knew the items included in this package would be small, and they sure were!!  But it is a nice selection of things to try and then I could purchase bigger products of the things I liked the best.  It would make a nice gift also for someone who likes to mess with their nails.
507. My 11 year old daughter got this bath bomb in her Christmas stocking and she loved it. She has used other bath bombs in the past and they were a bit of a let down so we weren’t expecting much. We were pleasantly surprised! It dissolved great, not too quickly, with lots of fizz and the color was a vibrant teal blue, just like in the pic. But the best part of this bath bomb is the fragrance! It’s called “Flower Bomb” and it’s described as smelling like “primrose”. I was dreading the smell because the scent of artificial floral beauty products is usually pretty awful, in my opinion. This bomb smelled so pretty! Not too strong or overly sweet. I’m super picky about smells and I loved it! I’d definitely buy this particular bomb again and it’s likely that I’d try others made by Da Bomb. Oh! And it came with the little flower eraser shown in the pic. So cute!
508. Nicely packaged and handy to carry
509. Bath wrap
510. Terrific quality. Just as described and promptly delivered.
511. There are times I just cannot get an unpleasant, bitter taste out of my mouth, no matter the products I try - a variety of tongue scrapers, tooth brushes, gels, gargles, and other gimmicks, nothing dealt with that nasty, rancid after taste. If I had the misfortune to wake in the middle of night, I would wind up going through the whole regimen of brushinggargling to get rid of that taste just so I could go back to sleep.Recently I stumbled across the "Tongue Sweeper". It probably wouldn't work, but ok, it was worth one last try. WOW. With the first use, this simple little tool immediately and completely eliminated that stubborn bitter taste. I have to say it again: WOW.Now I use the Tongue Sweeper daily and any time that rotten, nasty taste creeps up. For me a high quality, simple tool, that is unlikely to break, wear out, or need replacing, is well worth the one time investment.
512. I like the easy and quick pouring sprout the attach measuring cup is easy and good
513. The perfect gag gift but I kept it for myself lol. A great conversation piece as well!
514.  Very impressed with this stop and squat foot stool. It is made of great quality plastic that is sturdy and has a decent weight to it. It is great for people who are shorter than 6 feet and really uncomfortable for someone taller. I am 5'5&quot; and it works great for me. My significant other is 6'1&quot; and finds it really hard to use. It allows me to have a productive bowel movement, and it takes some adjusting for your intestines to understand what is going on lol but I am happy with it and recommend to those who want to have a BM the way man was supposed to have it. There is a gap in the middle for you to line it up evenly in front of the toilet. Great bathroom experience nonetheless.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.
515. These are very good shoe insert insoles. I have small narrow feet and I was able to place these inside my flats with no issue. I did have to cut the inserts to fit correctly in my shoes but other than that, they are very comfortable and keep my heels from hurting as they did before. They provide the perfect amount of cushion in my shoes without making them feel funny on my feet. It was very hard trying to shape with scissors so that it didn't hurt the area under my toes. But in the end, it worked out. Overall, great insoles and great size after adjustment cutting.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
516. My right foot has a bunion growing bigger and have been looking for something to help ease the pain. This bunion corrector does okay but by it being so squishy, it isn't really correcting anything. All it does is provide a cushion between my big toe and second toe. I've turned it go horizontal between my toes and that seems to help better. Still on a hunt to find something other than surgery to correct it.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
517. good for the price
518. Works great and shipped quickly!
519. If this is made in Germany, I'm Abraham Lincoln... Chinese knockoff? And it's tiny... with a synthetic "leather" case. Bummer!
520. All that’s missing is a hunk to clean the carpets for me.  Great can of spot remover!
521. Feels flimsy and I’m afraid every time I step Down on it
522. This is an amazing toothbrush. I have metal in my lower bottom gums with holes to snap into the teeth. I went looking on Amazon and found this amazing product. They keep help get the food out. I will be a couple more because they come from another country and it takes a little longer to get them. So I will buy two more.
523. They were all tangled up together in a baggy. They are awfully thin and of poor quality. Several of them broke after 2 or 3 uses. They were packaged in a sloppy manner.
524. I use this along with two other ways to help naturally treat my sons {11} ADHD. 10 drops in the OJ in the morning mixed with two other things brings my kid way down. Enough to focus at school without Adderal. I have tried many things for years and finally have the combo he needs. This was recommended to us by my sons new holistic DR.
525. Love these, they work just great. My only peeve is that they squeak, but I remedied that by coating the squeaky parts with graphite as a dry lubricant so that it didn't collect dust and hair. I have advanced peripheral neuropathy, a nerve condition, so walking is a pain. The cane I used just doesn't cut it anymore, I needed support on both sides, so I puchased these and can move around swiftly instead of slow.
526. I got it before the time was up and it is so good that I use it on my salads and other food. It is delilious.
527. Used at my son's party! It was a good buy!
528. my kids love mario and these bandaids are too cute. decent quality too! must have for mario fans! my kids are 7 and 2 and love them! too expensive though.
529. I like these clear shoe straps.  I use them to keep shoes on my feet, not just high heels.
530. Works wonders if your on your feet working long shifts
531. Definitely helps keep glasses up!
532. I found these Bamboo makeup remover reusable pads to be a good concept.  It has a large surface area (3 inches diameter) for applying makeup remover, facial lotion, etc.  I found that I can soak it with cold water and place each one over my eyes.  It fits exactly over each eye.  It is a nice, relaxing treatment for my tired eyes.  The material is very soft, but not as absorbent as I wanted.  There are two sides- a white and black side.  I found the black side to be more absorbent.I gave it one fewer star, because:1) Because of its size, it’s hard to apply around the eyes.2) It is recommended to wash the 16 pads in the provided mesh bag in cold water and then to dry on a towel.  It took a few hours to dry them.  I will put them in a dryer from now on.  It is made of 70% bamboo and 30% cotton, so it shouldn’t shrink too much.It comes with a nice bamboo holder that looks minimalistic on my bathroom counter.  This product is a nice way to avoid using endless cotton pads which can reduce waste and help with expense.
533. I sure could have used this sound machine when my son was a baby.  The sound quality is clear and authentic.  The sounds are so soothing, gentle, and pleasant.  I don’t feel like the sounds are repetitive.  I am listening to the lullaby one while typing this review, and I am ready to nod off.  It is a compact sized at only 5 inches in diameter and 1.5 inches tall.  It is made of high grade plastic.  It is powered by an USB plug.  There is no option for batteries usage, though.  There are 8 sets of controls including the onoff switch, and they are located on the top of machine.  It is very easy to change the settings by using a light touch.A nifty feature is that the color of the machine changes with the touch of a button.  Very muted and relaxing.  There is an option for onoff light.  The timer can be set at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.  Everything gets shut off quietly when the time is up.  Although I pretty much have dozed off by then.  I would definitely recommend this sound machine.
534. As with the other reviewer, we also used the wrong length long screw for the attachment of the soap bar onto the seat.  We also ended up with a protruding screw in the middle of the seat.  We took the screw back out, and then used the shorter length screw.  Since we were left with protruding hard plastic in the middle of the seat, my husband pounded it down with a hammer to make it smooth.  The lesson of this story is make sure you are using the correct length screws.As far as the shower seat itself, it seems very sturdy.  I like the wide rubber feet. Each rubber foot is 3 inches in diameter.  Each leg has six adjustable heights to the height you desire.  The seat is 20 inches by 11 inches and has handles on the long ends to lift yourself up.  The soap dish is nice but sits too close to the seat.  When you raise your rightleft hand to grab the soap, the rightleft hand keeps hitting the soap dish.  Make sure you take extreme care.  A blue mesh bag hanger for other toiletries is also included.  It is a good shower seat except for the two negative things I mentioned.  I feel comfortable enough to allow my elderly father to use this shower seat.
535. Before you buy this, measure the diameter of your front carseat’s headrest pole.  The clamp’s maximum diameter is 0.5 inch.  If your headrest pole diameter is more than that, it won’t clamp properly.  My headrest pole diameter is slightly larger than 0.5 inch, so the clamp can’t completely encircle the pole.Other feature is that a tabletphone up to 7 inches (length or width) can fit.  The holder ratchets up and down to fit device.  A swing arm clamp allows for different rotational viewing.  It just didn’t work for my car.
536. Soak loofah in warm water; with scissors, snip loofah like carpet and bury beneath aquarium gravel or planter. Burrowing roots will anchor to loofah. It's an affordable alternative to lava rock or driftwood.
537. Great product. My family and I noticed less gas and bloating in just a couple of days after taking prebiotic.
538. Really was excited to get this product due to the practically of it. THEN I received the product.Pro -Very well made  qualityGreat designCons -PriceyVery heavyLarge deviceI rated this item three (3) stars for these reasons -the weight of this product limited me to carry my medications on me, which was the whole reason I purchased it and secondary the price of the product.UPDATE - I have received a personal phone call from the owner. We talked about her product line and during the conversation she really showed me her commitment to customers and designing great products.When ordering just make sure you get the appropriate size that is going to meet your needs. Also, if weight is going to be a  consideration than I would suggest ordering A device in titanium. I am awaiting a new titanium dual camber device. I will update after I compare the products side by side
539. I bought 2 in different colors.  One holds a nebulizer and all its parts in one place.  The other holds personal home medical equipment.  No more bulky boxes.  The different colors helps separate things.  And family members can easily find home medical supplies.
540. I needed something to keep my medical stuff in at home.  This is holding 2 BP machines, O2 meter, glucometer in the outer pockets plus a few other things.  I like to be organized and have "like" things together.  I'm happy that all my medical equipment is together in one bag.
541. This novelty eyeglass stand was heavier and more sturdy than I thought it would be.  It was adorable and was perfect for a family member who is a huge Westie fan.  I was quite pleased with the purchase and would recommend to others.
542. Great tree skirt here.  I've gone through several in the past few years that were flimsy and cheap.  This one is beautiful and fluffy and just isn't your normal red ugly tree skirt.  It's also a good size.  The velcro tabs underneath also help latch the skirt together and keep the skirt together making it look like it's one solid piece.  I highly recommend.
543. It's nice to soak but I don't think any type of home foot soaker will have the power of an actual foot massage.  But for soaking for spa purposes it worked great. My feet were soft and smooth after 20 minutes of soaking and the heat works great without getting too hot. The bubbles were stronger than other ones I have tried. There is a vibrating function which does feel nicer than I thought it would.  The rollers are a bit hard though after 20 minutes of soaking.
544. I like it! Usually I throw half a banana, ice, and some ovaltine with it, just depending on how hungry I am. I do two scoops, which I think comes to less than 2 dollars a meal. Use it for breakfast and sometimes dinner too.PRO TIP: Save the scoop from the previous purchase, because sometimes the measuring scoop gets buried at the bottom from shipping.
545. Seemed to really help my adrenal fatigue
546. Really sad this heating pad didn't heat. Very soft and packaged with it's own nylon sleeve, but that doesn't bring relief to achy muscles. Sadly had to return.
547. They hold up well
548. This is filled with rice, and is kind of heavy.  It is also a moist heat.  Disappointing part is that it should be discarded after 6 months because of the rice.  I might keep it in the freezer to keep it longer, I did not intend on using this for daily use.
549. This polish is so pretty!
550. Works well, sized appropriately according to the sizing guide listed. Definitely helps with mild knee pain.
551. Great to clean and sanitize wounds.
552. This thing is sized to fit a little tiny teenage girl or perhaps a child below the age of 15. Myself however, I am a 38 year old slightly overweight man. I started trying to put this thing on and felt my shoulder pop and then I had to literally cut this thing apart in order to remove it from around my shoulders. Description of the size is completely inaccurate. I will not be purchasing any products like this ever again. I will attempt to improve my posture some other way. If I need to get surgery on my shoulder again... ughhh no just no. Buyer beware.
553. Its simple but still holds everything. my bible and my notes. has many pockets too good for pens, papers and more.
554. It cleans
555. Done buying these, they are average to poor at best.  save your money.  More garbage sold on Amazon
556. Overpriced.
557. However, the labels are sub-par there are better ones available. Also, the purple foam backing would not stick. I eventually had to take a hot glue gun to this thing. I think the manufacturer should place it in permanently instead of giving us ineffective sticky tape pieces and asking us to do it ourselves.
558. my only regret is not buying more! (just need 4 more!)
559. Don't know how clean it makes my teeth, but I love the taste of the Splashin' Citrus. I could eat it. Actually why not; Bentonite is edible and so is citrus. I have tried various forms of the Redmond toothpastes, but I hate trying to get the last of the paste out of the plastic tube. It makes me nostalgic for the good old days of the metal tubes that stay rolled when you roll them. With the new plastic tubes, you probably lose about 14 of the toothpaste in the tube.
560. The old ViraStop is now renamed Enzyme Defense. Seems to be very effective in heading off a cold. I just ordered more. Last night woke in middle of night with stuffed nose that had already started to run. I went to the kitchen and popped one capsule of Enzyme Defense and woke up with nasal passages cleared. The last cold I had resolved with Enzyme Defense in 4 days which is very unusual. Without ED my colds typically turn into bronchitis. Two hours after breakfast (needs to be on empty stomach) I am going to pop another cap.
561. This allows you to gently touch your skin while not rubbing hard on it. This bottle should last a lifetime.
562. This is a well-made case that holds the essential oils that I like to carry.  There is a long strap to carry over the shoulder or two small straps to carry by hand.  The two zippered compartments make it conveniet to hold bottles of oil upright in the base or the roll-on bottles in the top.
563. I used to be a bug buffet, but no more. This stuff works! Nice fragrance and lightweight. Highly recommend!
564. Great product and delivered as promised.
565. Used these for multiple events during Covid to ensure no one touching cupcakes and offering contact free favors for a drive thru shower. I tried adding a cupcake topper in the container and it got a little squashed but make them smaller (topper) and it’s perfect. We put the topper on the top outside of the container and it was still so cute! All closed well and were sturdy. Very pleased with this purchase (we used Sam’s club cupcakes)
566. Great little things for small messes and small hands!
567. Before I had my daughter I went out on a limb and bought this as an in case for diaper blow outs and spit up stains. I couldn’t be happier. It works really well! I have found that sometimes I need to spray and soak for an hour or so and then do it again if needed. If it doesn’t come out after the first wash I end up filling my sink with hot hot water and dumping a little bit into the sink and letting it soak over night (if it’s a really bad stain) and it comes right out after that next wash! My daughter just started solids which is a completely different stain than spit up and diaper blow outs but this stain remover works just as well!
568. beautiful stone!! but it did not really work for me. I think I am better off buying these in person I have had better luck
569. Curls my eyelashes like never before. Most amazing one I've owned
570. This stuff is amazing! Really helps to clean my face
571. I love these!! They're great, i use it on sore muscles & onmmy face every day and night. Works very well & is very effective! I love that it has 2 to chose from
572. Great Product, thanks to smiley 360 I got to product test this and it works great, they sent me a full sized product to use and test for them.  I love how smooth my lips feels and how renewing they are.  I can put it on before I put on lipstick and it works great!
573. Returned, itchy material.
574. Like some other reviewers I don't like wearing a wrist watch. Especially in the summer. I often get out my phone to check the time, but this can sometimes be a problem at times. This solves that problem. I attached to my pants so that the face reaches in side the coin pocket so its easy to get to. Keeps accurate time and is easy to read.
575. The directions were confusing. The heating pad didn't heat and there no instructions on where to put it even IF it did work. Garbage.
576. Barely measured out to 16", nowhere near the 17" as advertised. Washing element has already starting separating. Cheap.
577. These are awesome for your throat.  They melt slowly and go down to your throat and the flavor of honey is the best part.  I've been using these for the past 50 years.  They are hard to find in a store so I buy them all the time from Amazon!
578. This swag is pretty but it is not as pictured. The picture is showing purple and some pink . What I received is nice and full, but it is all purple. I might get more silk flowers to add to it because the one color is boring to me. I put it on my front door..
579. Love how it long but not bulky when folded.
580. These don't work as well as I remember them working as a kid, but does the job. 12 even 14 tablet works just as well as a whole. Fun for the kids, but I won't order them again - not worth the price!
581. I cannot remember to take it as required so no results to report... but if this continues I will not re buy.  thanks!!!!!!!
582. Nice small massager.  Sometimes it hits a little too hard for my tastes, but I just adjust my body and it works well.  I like the option to have heat or not.  It also has a stretchy strap that can be added to your chair.  I have mine wrapped around a sturdy pillow and put it behind me on the sofa.
583. This review is based on my experience. So I've tried several silver lozenges and I believe the Manuka Honey from American Biotech is the best. I wish they made it with agave syrup for those watching their blood sugar. Just buy it already, lol.
584. Who doesn't like a back scratcher?
585.  I saw reviews that said the brushes were not turning. Mine didn't either but just as I was about to return them, I stuck them on again. They work perfect. Weird. They are just like the original.  Just stick them on again. They do work.
586. Sent back. Just did not need after all
587. Saw nicer ones at the dollar store
588. Very soft and holding up pretty well to washes.
589.  I saw reviews that said the brushes were not turning. Mine didn't either but just as I was about to return them, I stuck them on again. They work perfect. Weird. They are just like the original.  Just stick them on again. They do work.
590. Sent back. Just did not need after all
591. Saw nicer ones at the dollar store
592. just as shown and just as stated, the suction cups could be better but the price was right
593. I was looking a pair of Calf Compression Sleeves for my running sessions and these ones are great. I'd buy them again
594. Ok these are great so far. Takes forever to arrive or at least feels like when can't see.  Light and comfortable to wear for long periods
595. I got this free at CVS using extra bucks, but that price still seems too high. Mine had no mechanical problems, and the vibrations were pretty strong. It shook the entire table, which makes me wonder if it should be containing that vibration and channeling it into the jewelry more efficiently. It’s important to note that the cvs price was only 7.99, and I got it half off after Christmas for basically four bucks. I tried it first with just warm water. No change, my jewelry still had some grime. Then tried with a drop of Dawn, same result. The photo in my review is after two cycles, the debris in the lid is from dropping it while trying to open it, that wasn’t actually removed by the device. I also experienced difficulty removing the lid, but i was able to get it apart with just my hands. Save your money, don’t get it.
596. Yes. I really like this product.
597. These things are GREAT!  Just add a small amount of water and they open right up.  I keep these in the truck, in the first aid kid, in the soccer practice bag, kids back packs, literally everywhere I can think to put them.  The towel itself, once opened, is sturdier than a standard paper towel and work great.  I would and will buy these again.  To the folks that gave them poor reviews because they couldn't open them - Read the directions and add literally a few drops of water (maybe a couple drops of common sense too) and your product if fully functional.
598. These are really soft and easy to insert.  Much better than others I've used.  At this price, just buy em. . .
599. Blocks out all light but does not stop sounds completely.
600. product as stated.
601. Fits perfectly and I am a chunky gal. Holds the sensor in place. I thought the green would be more teal-ish, but it is a bright green. Not horrible though.
602. Cleans the air in my car beautifully. Leaves it freah.
603. My daughter loves it. She does not waste any makeup like with a sponge that it would soak into.
604. Wow no. First of all. First time I tried to use it I slid off my chair and hit the ground. Later when I kept trying to find a way to use it it left deep deep gouge marks in my skin. Def a waste. And painful. Bizarrely painful
605. Give or take a few that were messed up and stuck together, I'm very happy with the quality of the product. Though it would be nice to know what the blue thing is for.
606. not sure if this is working but it is plugged in next to the bed. I guess it is mental. The big one we got for the room works for sure.
607. I had high hopes for this. I have a similar shaver that's getting old, but this one — well, for whatever reason, the blades are at the wrong angle to actually shave. And boy did I try, but I couldn't get it to work. (I never had this problem with the other model.)Also, it has two Gillette-style blades separated by a half inch of space, so even if it did work, it would leave a stripe between the shaved areas. (And, sadly, although they are almost identical to Gillette blades, they have slightly different mounting doohickeys, so you have to buy the manufacturer's replacements.)
608. Great stuff! Works awesome on all baby, kid and adult stains. Formula, spit up, baby food and leaky diapers. Works better than any other stain remover I've tried!
609. This stuff works great for tough stains on baby, kids and adults clothes! It removes everything! Baby food, formula, spit up stains, even old spit up stains even (with little scrubbing) and even stains from blow out diapers!! I will never use another stain remover again, just this one!
610. My nephews love this game!
611. Helps with a bed ridden person and you can warm them in the microwave.  They are also thick and cushioned.
612. Works perfectly..we can't sleep without it!
613. This thing is amazing. I don't know what I was doing with my life before it came along! I use it for my shoulders and my neck mostly, but it also wraps around my waist and doubles as period-pain relief when needed!
614. Amazing product! I’m so happy I finally bought a tongue scraper! It really makes a difference!!! I felt like I was suffering from build up on my tongue it felt awful but this help a ton!!!
615. Trying to find an eyeglass holder for a man was unattainable until now.  Everywhere we looked, all the eyeglass holder were for women, dainty, beads, etc.  These are leather and high quality.  They were easy to attach to the glasses and were adjustable to the width of the frame.  Great product and you can't beat the price for three of these in one package.
616. Works great
617. Easy to install, does some filtering. Need to make a XL size.
618. I needed these to recycle shedded paper. Not a bad deal and the bags are well sealed and packaged to prevent tears and spills.
619. I like Ked this bottle but after using it on my glasses it seems to quit working. So I thought it was a glass cleaner. Never said that. So I cleaned my glasses first and spray lasted about 3-4 hours. Nice convienant bottle
620. This picture is deceving. The photo makes it look like it has a bend but it is straight.
621. This is what exactly I was looking. I started taking a little bit (approximately 400mg) by mixing with honey. I can eat this way, but my wife can not because of it;s bitter taste. so, bought some empty veggie capsules from Amazon and filled with this extract.I'll update if i notice any significant health benefits after using couple of months. As of now, I can give 5 stars for this product's quality.
622. *wifes review*This is a really amazing product. If you are concerned about saving money and hygiene this is the perfect item for you. The sponge is really durable and will last a long time and it also uses about half of the make-up product that a regular sponge would use. It is also super easy to clean and since it doesnt absorb water or make-up you dont have to worry about letting it dry completely to prevent mold. It does feel a little weird on your face and takes a little longer to blend out but I think it actually looks more natural and smooth once fully applied.I'm only giving it 4 stars because it is a little hard to blend into your hair line, around your eyes and the crease of your nose but other than that I think this sponge is awesome.
623. I make a Heavy Metal Detox Smoothie that includes fresh cilantro but I don't always have it and I also don't like the taste of fresh cilantro very much. This extract works perfectly and the taste is masked with the other smoothie ingredients.
624. I broke the first Aromyst I had by dropping it. I liked it so much I purchased another one instead of a different brand. I like the looks of the black diffuser as well as the options of a continuous mist or an on-off mist. I use it every other day or so.
625. I used it once, and it worked fine. I stored it outside in a storage bench, and the next time I pulled it out, the dustpan was completely warped and no longer usable. What a waste. It was brand new!!
626. Husband loves the tips.. Smooth. Papers are longer than average but work well, like the fact they're unbleached and &#34;raw&#34; too.Easier to use than expected and seem quailty made. Overall, no complaints - would recommend!
627. Product itself is very nice quality, one button for ease of use and comes with a drawstring  bag for long term storage.Has an array of vibration patterns..and is comfortable to use, soft and smooth.Perfect for the gspot, however if you require alot of stimulation in the front area the vibrations might not be strong enough for you there, however they are very strong in the top part! Had the vibrations been stronger in the lower half I would have given 5 stars.It requires 3 AAA batteries that aren't included.It is a welcomed addition and I will continue to use.. And would overall recommend the product.Great Quality!!!Item was received for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review - that in no way affected my opinion
628. Vibrations definitely exceeded my expectations for the smaller size! I have another that is similar in size and appearance but its not as strong!!Product itself seems to be pretty well made and has a nice sleek look to it...And is comfortable to use. Buttons are easy to control and get to.Product packaging was also very well done. It comes in a box with the brands logo and then in a black velvet bag for more permanent storage.The bonus plug that is included is flexible and soft, but has a hard time staying in place.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend. Would buy again.Item was received at a reduced price I'm exchange for an unbiased and honest review - that in no way affected my opinion
629. Which means if you are a back sleeper, you will wake up with a horrible headache.
630. Gets the job done, but you have to use two at once to get any meaningful coverage.  I rather the company just make half and give us bigger sizes.
631. Knocks out all my aches & pains
632. Does the job!
633. It didn't stop the hip pain that occurs when I drive.  I think the situation is just too bad for it to help.
634. MagSRT provides a higher dose than other available slow release formulas, and avoids the digestive distress that can be associated with regular release versions. However, given the cost, I would not recommend this as a first line magnesium supplement - try a regular release version, then a lower dose slow release if needed, and use this only if you require both the slow release and the higher dose.This version of MagSrt also provides B vitamin supplementation (B6, B12, Folate), which they say enhances absorption of the magnesium. The evidence for this is quite thin - some limited in vitro studies, but no in vivo human trials with positive results that I'm aware of. That said, there's no particular problem with the B vitamins being in the mix, except you may be taking something you don't need. Jigsaw does offer a B vitamin free version (MagSRT B Free), although the cost is the same.The pills are large, but not absurd (as some supplements can be), and have a uniquely smooth coating that makes them easy to get down. They have no particular odor or taste and no aftertaste. They can be split cleanly with a pill cutter, although I don't know what impact this has on absorption.Four stars for quality, one off because of the cost. A years worth, at the recommended dose (4 pillsday) is over $250.
635. Works great
636. My husband and I just got this model after trying a different brand that only allowed us 2 hours of heat. I was worried that I wouldn’t be happy with the size because the other one was larger, but this one is plenty big. We both like using it to keep our feet warm, and it certainly does that. Plus, I’m not waking up every few hours to turn it back on! I love how quickly it heats up and it’s also very soft. We think we’re going to forget the heated mattress pad this winter, and just go with this.
637. Awesome kit that I keep near me at all times. I keep one in my belt and one in my bag at all times. These things are literal lifesavers.
638. I really and truely believe this product helped me in my weight loss plan.  I began dieting and exercising while supplementing this product.  After about 8 weeks or so, I had lost 15lbs.  I don't think I would have lost that much without this product.  I am still working on losing 10 more pounds and continue to use this product.  It is hard for me to lose weight also, because I am not very much overweight, so it takes a lot more for me to lose weight, and this gives me that extra help.  I recommend this product as a supplement to dieting and exercising.
639. Ordered on Thursday received this morning. Screwed right on! Perfect fit. Very soft love it!
640. YES!!!! Such a great product. Works great for our Dilli Dalli frames. So glad we found these. Great quality, and have held up great.
641. They work, they will cut a penny and get you naked fast enough. The black paint will come off if scraped, but they were pretty affordable, look cool and they do what they are suppose to. I feel comfortable having these on the rig with me.
642. This thing has got some power!  It does a nice job gently removing callous.  I was even able to (carefully) remove a callous between my toes that has caused me pain for a long time.  Pain is gone!  I recommend it.  It's been worth every penny to me so far.
643. Best price I could find and arrived earlier than expected.
644. Does exactly what I bought it for. Works great, keeps the gin rummy mess in place and the ability to spin makes it easier for the whole table to reach.
645. I also purchased this with a Groupon and it's a piece of junk. It barely heats up at all and does very little to curl my lashes. Wish I hadn't thrown the packaging and stuff away bc I'd return it if I could. I like my Panasonic one much better, although you have to hold the switch down to get it to heat. I bought this one thinking it would heat while I was doing other things, which it does, it just doesn't curl very well.
646. Just as described. Holds to basics.
647. They fit on my stethoscope.
648. Horrible quality. It’s so cheaply made and flimsy. I would not pay $10 for this. Dollar store quality.
649. Decent brush - I use diesel to clean and gear oil to lube.  I had plans of using one brush for the cleaning and one for the lubing.  Then when I went to lube chain, I found I was too lazy to get up and grab the second brush...so I use the same brush for cleaning and lubing.  Holding up so far.
650. They are very sturdy and precise
651. Smell great and are very thick!
652. As expected, no concerns
653. Broke at the seam completely while putting it on once. Also, the &#34;heavy duty&#34; velcro flaps to hold the o-ring cracked. all this within 2 months. Very disappointed, especially since I bought it at a store and paid way too much for it. Granted, I don't use these things lightly, but it makes it sound like they are for real, hard, heavy use... It is not.Stick with the simpler harnesses. Go with what works.
654. These capsules work very well when taken at night and in the morning on an empty stomach.
655. Didn't find anything special about the product than others on the market, but does provide temp. relief
656. I would carry the flat piece in my purse to apply under my puffy eyes from allergies and when visiting family who live in a metropolis full of smog (car gets covered in filth from the residual smog). Really helped my fiance when he went through coffee withdrawals, too.
657. The body brush is indeed only for your body, unlike that from higher end models. I have not used this in the shower with batteries because I am not convinced the casing will not allow water into the battery compartment.
658. We buy a lot of supplements to aid in our immunity as a family because we have small children that attend school. The tincture prevents or halts the illness. I don’t know if it’s coincidence or because of this fantastic product. Daily, I have taken the recommended 15 to 60 drops (half the dropper). Days that I take the product I do not contract any illness and I feel great. Then, sometimes I forget and see that I’m getting sick like a scratchy throat or some congestion I start taking it and it halts the illness, And I was a 99% of the time the illness does not become worse after taking this product. All in all I would have to say this is a five star product and a fantastic supplement to have in your home if especially if you have family members that are immunocompromised.
659. very nice product ..works great ..made very sturdy...great price would recommend this product to any one looking for a foot spa
660. Incredible buy, very well made, lights and alarm work perfectly. I'm talking this on my Russian river cruise!!!!
661. When I read the review that said she was having trouble sleeping due to her psoriasis, I thought, this is something I have to try. I can't sleep either, but it's because of allergies, and my skin feels like it's on fire.I tried it as soon as the package arrived. Oh, baby, where have you been all my life? It's so cooling, which would have been enough, but it also leaves my face feeling baby smooth (at my age, that's a BIG plus). I just used a little bit, and it's made a huge difference.I believe I'll be using this cream for a very long time. Thanks!
662. Highly recommend! Works great. Quick and easy to use. Makes feet very soft. Would definitely buy again.
663. Junk. Didn't even last a year before it just randomly stopped workingwon't charge. Too bad, I actually liked it until this.
664. Very difficult to use. Very hard to get out of the tube. A caulking gun would have been easier!
665. It's exactly as pictured and described. I can't find any fault in the container.
666. Oh. My. On all things holy, GET THESEThese are AMAZING! I took a big whiff of the bag and it allowed me to breath better already... but once you put it in your shower 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 I swear it’s like Baby Jesus himself came to rid me of my allergies 🤧 I can breathe y’all!!! I can really breathe!
667. Broke faster than we could get them to work.
668. I recently purchased a model that looks identical to this one - I can't review that model because the page for it no longer exists ( just days after mine arrived ).  The product I received gave wildly inaccurate and highly different readings each time used.  Yes, we know how to use it, my better half is a trained EMT.  The readings were far off those from my doctor as well as being vastly different from each other.And guess what else? No way to send it back!  You get forced into a troubleshooting page or a page that tells you it cannot be returned!  Fortunately, the CS at big A are fantastic and fixed my issue, but seriously folks, you should not trust something as important as your health to any product from this company.
669. If you have a husband who snores and keeps you awake at night I would suggest you buy these. I don’t know how I have lived so long without these.
670. Sleep....too much noise around here!
671. I like that it doesn't bother my digestive track!
672. This really is an excellent toe nail clipper....much better than the typical style most people use, and easily the best I have tried. The long-handled small scissors-on-the-end type are hard to use and often do not cut cleanly and easily.For the average person, however, I'm not sure I would recommend it for fingernails, since it can leave a bit of a rough edge.
673. I own and have been using straight razors for years. I figured I would try a shavette for those times when I dont feel or have the time to strop or touch up the edge on the standard straight edge. I bought two of them to see which one I would like. Both are the &#34;push type.&#34;This one is all coated metal and is heavier than my standard straights. Even heavier than my Spartacus str8s. But the main reason I am writing this review is how even the blade sits in this unit. With this unit the blade fits perfectly even in the holder. The heavier metal really holds the blade in place beautifully tight and perfectly exposed. The other shavette I got was the cut throat with a multi colored wood handle from Ebay for $15.The handle was nice but the blade holder metal was quite a bit thinner and the edge of the blade was not evenly exposed. That is because the two metal edges where the blade comes through are not even. One edge is higher than the other and not parallel from one side to the other. As the metal is thin, I tried to bend the two edges so they would line up better. No luck. Once metal is bent, it is hardened. Summary, this Matte slide out is a higher quality unit with quality control that is necessary for the blade to be exposed evenly.  Fun to shave with and convenient.
674. It has an small buckle that sit in your ear when you sleep in your side.
675. These came beautifully packaged and would make a great gift (send me some- really).  They are surprisingly large bath bombs and my bath felt really luxurious when using these.  I have sensitive skin and had no issues- probably the only downside was smelling great and having moisturized skin attracted some chiggers to my bare legs at the fair.  Lol. Seriously.  They were jacuzzi safe (no issues) and I definitely plan to use more of these bath bombs in the future. Five stars all the way!  Treat yourself!!!
676. The fit is too tight and very thin material the friction alone will cause it to break it needs to be redesigned and thicker so it won't break easily.
677. Great product I had hand surgery and sometimes is weak these piece provides nice weight so you will know when it leaves your hand.
678. Well I can honestly say these band aids don't work but they are good if you want to prevent itching the bite. Other than that they don't do anything. They do stay stuck for a couple of days even after a couple showers. I don't know if I will buy again.
679. It is alright.
680. good product
681. This replacement brush is just like the real Clarisonic brushes. I was pleasantly surprised how well they worked and also the price..can’t be beat.You will not be disappointed.
682. Cleans out what you don’t even know is there! Love it!!
683. This is my second unit. My daughter took my first one. Fells great on sore muscles.
684. Too bulky, too heavy, too awkward for a normal  usage, and too expensive.
685. I use these in my Halo mask! They are comfy, I can breathe!
686. Can I go lower than one star?  I found these bars completely inedible.... and the taste vile. Usually, when I don’t like something, I put it out for the various critters in our area. I threw these away as I didn’t want to be accused of cruelty to animals. Yuck!
687. sticks even on greasy surface
688. I really appreciated these extra durable Magic Erasers. I am moving and found them very helpful at removing wall smudges that might otherwise have required me to paint. I tried one of the knockoff brands and found that they disintegrated quickly. My recommendation is to pay slightly more and go with the original. I am back for more.
689. I put this filter near a litter box, and it definitely took care of the odor. However, it was incredibly loud for its size. I have since unplugged it.
690. I have purchased many &#34;beet&#34; products and Wilson Naturals is by far, the very BEST tasting, easy to drink, bake  cook or mix in a smoothie. Wilson Natural Beet product is outstanding and would encourage all to try. I will say I would hope they would make others such as, carrot and other veggie and fruit selections. &#34;WN's&#34; service is tremendous along with customer service who exemplify the very best and most professional I have dealt with. Thanks so much!
691. Super cute bags! I bought them for my med school friends graduation party and they were a hit! They didn't lookfeel cheap or tacky and were the perfect size to fit some candies, band-aids, and bone shaped pens.
692. Using it in my car has helped tremendously with pain running up the backs of my legs! Thank you!
693. I bought this to help me sleep. It took 2 tablespoons to do it but it did help.
694. &quot;Seemed like a good idea at the time.&quot; The clipper part spins on the handleengage part.  Except how do you make it STOP spinning?  I end up having to hold the head with some part of my other hand.  Other than that...
695. I have been using this to make my own vape juice and my other half likes it better than the store bought version.
696. I like the idea of a finger brush to brush my dogs teeth but I think the bristles are too soft to clean anything.
697. I'm sure they're good, they were too big for me.  Thankfully someone at the gym bought them from me.
698. Cleaning myself
699. Quality for a decent price.
700. My favorite flavor in the nectars so far. I have to be careful or I'll drink this stuff all day. It's delicious.
701. Bought it for my father in law to help with the cancer and it irritated his skin. Must find right portion to use maybe?
702. So thick that it is unusable for me. Nothing like Muro 128
703. The padding is comfortable, almost like sitting on firm jelly. Very different from memory foam type pads. Good for desk work, would be too high for car seats though. We'll see about durability, as I wonder how long the viscoelastic material will hold up
704. These are inexpensive and a decent value for product. You get exactly what you pay for and what you expect.
705. Love this product!!
706. It's great
707. Adorable. Not absorbent at all. This product is an underwear for looks. Very cute on. And good for letting those areas down there breathe. If you dont want mess or leaks, put over diaper for cute look. Nice and big....my son is three, still potty training and its roomy on him. Hes around 35 pds
708. This contraption works.  I have a little tummy and some of my jeans fit fine in the hips but pinch at the waist.  I stretch them out using this device and wallah, they fit like they are custom made!
709. It's was ok. Wasn't thick enough and doesn't wrap all the way around table. I've had better ones.
710. I've purchased for international S. America and Vietnam travel.  When it pours the lotion separates from the insect oil and I have a tough time getting to two to meld.
711. Fit very well for my electric scooter 🛴
712. makes it so much easier to clean my water bottles, this is fabulous, great to have two, arrived well packaged.
713. I am very impressed by how light weight and extremely comfortable they are.
714. Makes nice curls and easy to use
715. We ordered a 3 pack of these glasses.  The first pair lasted a week, the 2nd pair lasted two weeks, and the 3rd pair lasted 2 minutes.  The arms easily unscrew and either we can’t find the parts or we would need to buy a repair kit.
716. My wife was advised by her doctor to buy Pedifix Toe Straightener as she has a bunion and hammer toe.  Her toe next to her big toe sticks up and goes over her big toe and it's impossible to wear shoes.  If she hadn't heard about Pedifix Toe Straightener she would have had to have an operation.  She is able to wear shoes as the Pedifix Toe Straightener keeps her smaller toe in place.
717. Not enough iron to keep up with anemia, even taking double during the one week a month.
718. These break all the time.  Not worth the money.  Going to buy Stixx now.
719. I was Snow White for Halloween and this mask was a perfect addition to the costume!  Thanks!
720. needed them for security system - works great
721. Bought for my dad who is wheelchair bound, and gets terrible sores. He's always complaining about the pain and we've tried at least 6 different foam and gel cushions. This is the first time he feels comfortable sitting! Very grateful for such a great product, reasonably priced.
722. Excellent space saving footrest for shaving! Our shower is small so this fit the bill! Highly recommended
723. I don't feel like they do much.. 😒
724. Not going to complain about toilet paper these days. Just glad I could find some. This marcal TP was not bad, I’ve gotten some weird commercial no name brands that was not so great. This was decent.
725. I was pleasantly surprised how these pads helped easy pain on the balls of my feet when wearing heels. I was skeptical, but now I’m not. Recommended!
726. I always have difficulty keeping heels from slipping when I walk.  These are the best product I have found, my high heels stay on great.
727. I listened to the audiobook (magnesium miracle) and read so many good reviews. I took this for anxiety, which I get very easily. 2 to 3 hours after I consumed this, I had very bad anxiety for no reason.  It is no fun feeling like you can’t get a good breath of air and your heart is beating so fast.  I will not take another drop.  As everything I purchase on Amazon, I always get to return if not satisfied.  But checking this better, I cannot return it. Therefore $29.99 plus tax of $2.72 and shipping cost of $6.94, $39.65 down the drain.
728. I ordered a few mini snaps by mistake and was going to return them but decided to maybe get something to go with them.  This bracelet is perfect!  I have the large snap necklace so I have started collecting mini and large snaps.
729. This is the first time I have purchased this brand.  I needed to find a vitamin C that was not made in a factory that processes tree nuts and this one fit the bill.  The taste is fine.  The shipping was quick.  Would buy again.
730. Bought for a xmas present and she loves them!
731.  Purchase this unit as an addition to the current unit we already have because everyone in my house is sick and I did not want to transfer germs.  It works great.  The water flosser is excellent, very powerful (can be a little messy because of the force of fluid coming out).  I love the volume that the reservoir holds (over 24oz) and has a lid, to allow you to keep water in between uses.  The toothbrush is a soft bristle brush (I prefer firm), but after brushing for just overa minute, it got rid of most of the debris on my teeth except for the rear molars on the lower right side of my mouth.  The toothbrush is also a good tongue cleaner.  I used it for about one minute and was able to get rid of the majority of the white film on my tongue.
732. Pros: Handy dandy pump prevents mess.  Takes up little space.Cons: Can be difficult to get to the bottom, as you need to aim down to get it into the fabric softener dispenser.
733. Not good quality.
734. I finally found the readers that do not look like readers!  I have been looking for this specific design for well over a year. The packing is lovely.  A glass zippered case with wipe cloth, looks exactly like in picture.  I love these and will order extra pair.
735. Like others, I was disappointed with this cushion and ended up returning it within 24 hrs. Cushy & soft-yet-firm? Check.  But not cool, and it actually hampered blood flow to my legs no matter how I sat on it or positioned myself. Too expensive to be so mediocre.
736. I love these!  After wearing 'dollar store' readers for the last 4 years I decided I really needed something I didn't have to take on and take off at church and at class.  These are perfect.  Clear vision in both the 'plain' glass and in the readers I ordered in 200.Style and classy............or so my grandchildren tell me!
737. This is more like rubber and not like a sponge at all. I didn’t really like it for doing dishes or much of anything really.
738. I purchased these to clean black marks off a brand new kitchen counter at my office. The counter became scratched up from tin foil catering trays and general use and regular soap wasn't doing the job. With a little arm power, I was able to get off most of the black marks using the magic eraser :)
739. Loved them!! Used them for a winter camping weekend to heat up the sleeping g bag and to stay warm during the night and they stayed warm all night! No leaks! Now my son uses one to warm up his bed, lol.. Sturdy and tough material. Definetly worth it!
740. Loved them!! Used them for a winter camping weekend to heat up the sleeping g bag and to stay warm during the night and they stayed warm all night! No leaks! Now my son uses one to warm up his bed, lol.. Sturdy and tough material. Definetly worth it!
741. Would recommend these mask over all others I have purchased over the past few years. I can chew gum and talk while wearing these mask with no problem.
742. Does what it's supposed to and how its supposed to.
743. These don't work at all. In fact, they seemed to amplify some of the sound by reverberating basslow frequency in my ears. They were comfortable and soft silicone, but that means nothing if they don't work for their intended purpose.
744. I specifically purchased this to wear over an N95 mask.  There is no way I would use this on its own. Its the same type of material as most of my T shirts. You can see through it if you hold it up to the light.I took a picture of this next to a standard disposable mask and a 3M N95 mask as well as a picture of it stretched over an N95.  It doesn't cover it completly and requires it to be stretched a bit but it works alright and the wrap over your ears is slightly more comfortable than elastic.The sowing of the seems is well done and the material is about the same as a good t shirt.  So far they are working ok. I would like them slightly bigger but they work and seem well made.
745. I actually use the 'leg thing' on my bicep when I have my infusion set attached to the back of my arm. I really like it as I'm able to coil my line and place it in the pouch with the pump.
746. There is hate but this is like the classic Mac and cheese but I liked it more. Just your basic tasting noodles and fake cheese powder. Give it a try.
747. For the price, these earplugs can't be beat.
748. This is really great stuff.  It is natural.  It works.  I learned about it years ago when I was going to fly.  Now I fly more often and am in a car traveling on all kinds of roads and in mountains at times and it is just really wonderful to help keep motion sickness away.  It even works on ships as well.  his is really a wonderful find.  it is simple, nothing I have to wear like a wrist thing, not a pill where I could have side effects just simply an oil I put behind my ears.  I make sure I am always stocked up on this wonderful stuff.  I suggest it to anyone who may have a need.
749. They work great with dress shoes.
750. We had a couples baby shower and this game was part of the fun! Both the boys and the girls wanted to try to get their sperm directly on the egg.
751. This was a really low quality toothbrush.  It is very cheaply made and felt like only a few bristles on the brush.  Really disappointed in the quality.
752. Ok for a temporary fix.  Buy a new chair.  Better yet, make your company buy one.  OSHA
753. These bags are so extremely thin theyare a complete waste! Five bags completely shredded as I was trying to open one!
754. It’s surprising what you learn when you take this test! Who knew a lot of what I don’t like I am intolerant to- new excuse!!
755. I got this to mix with water to put magnolia leaves in per things I read.  It worked and the magnolia leaves are not brittle and work and look good in an arrangement.
756. Glasses adhere for a few minutes but the eventually just get greasy and slide off more than usual.
757. Didn’t work.  I have a more textured curly hair type, and this did nothing for me. My regular flat iron does a better job at straightening and curling my ends. Maybe it’s more for naturally straight hair??????? Idk
758. I wanted to buy a good pair of ear plugs for attending concerts and live shows, which I do frequently. I was torn between these and the Etymotic Research ER20-SMC Plugs so I ordered both. They are very similar especially in terms of sound quality (most won't notice a difference, although I do believe I prefer the DownBeats sound-wise,)but the DBs are far more comfortable in the ear. I recently went on a trip and couldn't find my DBs, so I took the Etys and also realized that they are even more uncomfortable when laying, unless you sleep on your back. I prefer the case on the Etys as it opens and closes quietly, but performance and comfort are the most important qualities in ear plugs. My friend also tried both and prefers the Etys, but only because he fears the short DownBeats will get stuck somehow. Ha.
759. As described. You can’t beat the price. I’ve used the big name brand ones and this brand does the job well.
760. Poor quality - has small holes and the rice began leaking out the first day I opened it
761. These are essential for a permanent bandage need I have, that needs to be changed before showering.  I found them by searching for the product number. I'm glad to have found them. They are sterile and easy to use.
762. I've used it for many years, but a few years ago it disappeared from the drug store & grocery shelves.  I don't know why, but Amazon continued to carry it.  This last shipment came from India. The cardboard boxes were all crushed, but the tubes were just fine.
763. ... does exactly what it’s supposed to do.
764. Does the job, removes the lint
765. Great purchase! One of my favorite pre-workouts.
766. I used to drink those ICE smoothies at Target, as a kid. Taste brings back memories! Quality is decent for getting a pump.
767. It does the job
768. PERFECT FOR THE BARBER SHOP !!!!!!
769. Excellent blood pressure monitor. No more spending money on batteries.  Charges quickly. Accurate like the battery operated monitors. Great price too. Very pleased.
770. Cute and nice bargain.
771. I like the fact this product came very fast.Also seems to be a good product.No problems at all.
772. Works fine.
773. I have had problems with nerve irritation in my legs from pressure. I don't have enough fat in those areas. Helps cut down on sciatic like pain. Good product exactly as described. Fast shipping.This is an edit to above. I gave the product the benefit of the doubt. It was not like the  ad photo. It was flimsy plastic with blue water and some little soft plastic beads inside. Where pressure was applied, all liquid shifted to another section. Like sitting on a balloon half full of water. It also started to leak after the first week and I only weigh 190 lbs. Flimsy and not gel filled.
774. 2 soft, when I placed it in my office chair it just goes down 😑
775. When I first got this gel, I thought that there was no way it was going to work but it does AND it is a large tube so you get your moneys worth. I have spinal stenosis and the weather is changing which means that I have more pain than normal but this gel has eased my joint pain. I recommend to everyone who suffers from arthritis, joint pain, stenosis, or even fibromyalgia.  I received this item either free or greatly discounted since I am a nation wide product tester and my testimony is true and unbiased
776. I was not a fan of this oil set. I use Doterra Oils but bought a blend set to use at work however all of these smell terrible and I can tell the quality is not great, probably because I am used to using Doterra.
777. Cannot adjust steam flow. Steam stops coming out even at high water level. Arm of steam not adjustablemoveable. Only the whole thing raises and lowers. The magnifying mirror is useless in its position and not very magnified.Update: It has now stopped working! After only 4 uses! Now it just spits out water rather than blowing out steam.
778. My hair is mainly straight but gets waived sometimes. The brush did not work well. I had difficulty in holding the brush and the hair at the same time. I would say it straightened my hair only 30%. I decided to return and invest on a better one. although I loved the color.
779. This is perfect for travel or home use. I am able to fit 4 pillsvitamins in each daily compartment. If I needed more, I would have to use two. I have considered using two anyway, one for am and one for pm. This has definitely helped my forgetful brain to know whether I have already taken my pills or not. I would absolutely purchase again! Good packaging and quick shipping.
780. The quality is nice and pattern is pretty.
781. These are so pretty and wash up great - hand wash. Would surely recommend.
782. Irritating to the skin
783. delivered as expected and container didn't have a large air gap.
784. Took first one felt good. After a week started getting super dry skin and thyroid actually swelled up. The only one seems to work for me was vita-Strength.I tried this because of the great reviews. Since back on Vita thyroid not swollen and dry skin,weight getting better. I can't recommend this in good faith.
785. Finish is now wrapped in some form of cover that is very hard to take off.  I am concerned that we eventually drink whatever we put into our water.So, I changed to Cascade powder since I love to measure my product and am not so lazy that I need a pod.Imagine my surprise when I could use the Normal cycle on my dishwasher with Cascade since I had to use Heavy Duty wash when using Finish.
786. This review process with Amazon has changed, you read reviews to a product that has nothing to do with the product your looking at
787. This is a perfect addition to some walkers.  Comes with liner that can easily be cleaned up without having to remove the tray from the walker.  However, pay close attention to the product images . . . this will not work on all walkers.  There must be a crossbar atnear the top of the walker for this to rest on when in service.  There is a different version of this tray for those walker without the upper crossbar.  This one won't work on most &#34;Drive&#34; brand walkers, but the other one (called the &#34;Pivot&#34;) probably will.
788. Is what was suspected
789. The bristles on mine are too flimsy to clean a tire and can barely agitate grime when applying a product like Griot's, but they do work ok for cleaning wheels. A decent option, but there are better products out there.
790. It works great. I thought it would be horrible quality bc it’s so cheap but it’s actually great. Not too rough on the skin, and very smallcompact. Make sure to charge before you use
791. This nose clip is useless.  It doesn't stay on.
792. I use this to brushclean my cat's teeth and they work better than I expected, I can use the same sponge 5 to 7 times without having it break, considering how sharp cat's teeth are, my cat does not resist, so is an easy process, I don't need to maneuver the sponge in a forceful way at all, when it breaks, just cracks, so far I haven't had a sponge breaking into pieces, I use it moist with the teeth cleaning spray they sell for pets, I have never used it dry.
793. These loofahs are quite soft and durable bath sponge. Material feels luxury and soft to the touch yet still foams and cleans well, not itchy or scratchy. I noticed that these do not become loose with just after one wash like others which I bought from my local stores. I dont like that there Is just one color to choose. this sponge won't expand or torn apart so quickly after few washes. I like that they came packed in such a lovely way - a set of three in a zipper pouch ... good gift idea 🤔Hmmm may be next time for someone.. they also come with a suction holder which is great to hang these loofah after wash..The only thing I wish it is the colors - they could have add multiple colors instead of just one. they have nice exfoliating material  and produces good amounts of lather as well and holds too. These are not too dense or thick as to take for ever as most loofahs do to rinse off the left lather after washing...
794. Lovely scent. Soft, silky, powder. Terrific quality, as Avon products always seem to have.
795. I am a massage therapist and I use the Jeannie rub in my work.  My customers love it.It does a fab job relaxing tense back muscles effortlessly.
796. Love the colors.  Using for make tissue paper carnations.
797. Its really hard to get the lid on right and it leaks out the top.
798. Don’t waste money on buying these I got them today and try to use them what a waste of time and money they have done nothing for my pain. No heat no relief just a waste of money. Stick with salon pas
799. I like that these don't dissolve with essential oils in them.
800. Along with elbow grease, they polish off the nasty residue on cookware and kill soap scum in the shower, including the once impossible bumpy ridges on the floor of our fiberglass bathtub. These also work great to remove the sticky palm marks on the banister that seemed endless and almost impossible to get off. Nothing is impossible with these dynamos! They wear through quickly when you really need to scrub, but they are still the best thing I have found to do almost any task. Thankful.
801. Good quality. This was recommended by my chiropractor. It definately helps to get to those hard to reach spots plus does a better job than just using your hands. I did travel with this and it came apart and clipped together easily.
802. Wouldn’t Spend more the. $10 on this. Malfunctions after first use.
803. Nice and small
804. I love this thing.,  It is easy to peddle and  you can set it up anywhere in the house.  You can watch tv or read a book while you peddle.  It is quiet and does not squeak.  It is not real heavy so you can quickly and easily move it to clean around it.  I put it on a rubber back rug so that it would not move on the hardwood floor while I peddled and I would suggest the same.  It will move away from you while you peddle, if it is on hardwood,
805. I have no idea if this works or not so I don't know how to rate it.
806. While I really like this product, this is the second time I got only 6 pieces in a box.  The boxes are not sealed so who knows where the seventh piece is!
807. One pair actually went too far into my ear, was able to get it out with tweezer. The bigger set does not block out most noise.
808. I can't remember the last time a purchase made me THIS happy! Doesn't matter what season it is, my feet develop thick calluses and crack open and bleed (not just on the heels).  I have used all manner of graters (sponges, files, microplanes, etc.) and while they make my feet smoother, I can't get rid of the calluses.  The Emjoi did what all of those other methods could never accomplish.  My feet are indeed smooth and SOFT after using it just a couple of times.  And oddly enough, even though it took the calluses down more completely than the other methods, it seemed to be gentler on my skin than the other tools, which often left me with sore or bleeding feet.  I will sing Emjoi's praises from the rooftops, LOL.
809. This filter has about 12 the pleats of prior filters I've used.  With fewer pleats there is less surface area for filtering so I suspect it will get dirtier sooner and I will have to change filters more frequently. Also, I have no idea how that affects performance. Maybe I should have looked at the picture more carefully because it is an adequate reflection of number of pleats though spacing it not as uniform. This filter was in a nondescript box with the filter itself covered in plain plastic.  There wasn't any info on manufacturer or Merv rating. Maybe contractors are their most likely consumer?  I would feel more comfortable being able to read about the product.
810. How did this get such a high review here?!... not for this tough,  scratchy, khaki colored denim fabric.  It is stiff with absolutely ZERO airflow.  I literally could feel the air being pushed out and sucked in from the sides.  And the handle around the ears is very uncomfortable as well.  I am so confused as to how and why this has such high ratings.  If I hadn't washed it b4 wearing,  I would have sent this piece of crap back.  What a waste of hard earned money. If only I could give it no stars
811. They would be more comfortable if they were the full length of the shoe.
812. This product really works to clean your windows outside in one easy step.  No prep cleaning needed.  Just Put the Renz EZ in the canister, attach it to a hose, put your finger over the little hole to let the soap dispense in a strong spay from the dispenser then lift your finger to rinse with a strong spray of clear water.  Expect to get a little wet.
813. Game was just okay. Some of the things (like putting your cell phone down your partners pants) were tasteless. Other things were alright, but I can't say I'd recommend this for anyone who has been in a long relationship. Mine is going on 7 years. I can see how it may be a decent bedroom icebreaker for newer relationships possibly. The game was in great condition and arrived on time.
814. After shaking the can as instructed and several minutes of trying to make it spray, it only sprays out half inch sized spot of powder.  Really worthless can.
815. Helped greatly. He refuses to get a hearing aid but this has enabled us to quit screaming all the time. I can also have the TV at an acceptable level before I go deaf.
816. This product is not for consumption and this information was not indicated in the description. I will never purchase from this company because I may get another product that I can’t use. The fact that you are unable to return products is another reason I am an unsatisfied customer.
817. Great product and good price.
818. This is a nice denture bath.  Good quality and comes in three pieces - the lid, the inside basket and the outer bin.  The lid comes off easy so it's easy to access the basket - it just lifts out of the bin.  I ordered the standard size and I was a little concerned it would be too small but nope - both my upper and lower dentures fit nicely.
819. Cute set, exactly as pictured. We actually left them outside after the party since I wasn't planning on saving them and they held up great. They made a nice addition to the decorations in the backyard!
820. We use this in a 10 x 12 bedroom that once had fire damage from a chimney fire. Even after killz paint,new hardwood, new fixtures, central air running, we could still smell it a little in one corner of the room. We recently had a baby and the newborn being in the room with us made me finally try this,  and it worked! At first I was a little uneasy about having something plugged in and running 247, but it only works well if running at all times.  It does put off a little bit of light and it sounds like a small fan.  So it's not super quiet, but the white noise is good for the baby anyway so I enjoy it. Overall I'm very very happy with this!
821. Plastic was thin,  to able to give as a gift as I had hoped.
822. Nice to have to store batteries but wish it was not all these little parts.  Maybe combine two together.
823. I love these gummies and they are yummy
824. Love these but the only problem is I got two silver ones and it said I would get one yellow gold and one silver so I'm not happy I got two silver ones so I will order more but other than that they are perfect and fit exactly the way I want especially since the other ones I ordered were too big.
825. This is a very good product.
826. Seems to be working....thus far, 4 weeks, my fruit and berries are not getting ucky!
827. VERY CHEAP, does not give correct weight. Total waist of money....
828. Lots of dental floss so I won't have to order it again in the near future. Also Prime free two day shipping to my front door, what more could you ask for? The floss is fairly thin which I wanted so I could floss in between a  couple really tight teeth I have. The flavor is subtle mint and at 55 yards one container has plenty of floss to last two months. By those calculations this order should cover one person for an entire year of daily flossing using just under 3 feet of floss each time.
829. I thought these caps would be a soft silicone that would stretch to fit over the heel but they're hard plastic and were WAY too big for my stiletto on my wedding day. My bridesmaids had to wrap my heels in toilet paper to wedge these caps onto the shoe! They might fit a thicker pump style heel but they are far from a universal fit.
830. This is my second basket to try with my knee scooter and I wished I had bought it first. It attaches easy and holds things I need freeing up my hands. I left the handle off mine and keep it attached to the scooter. I easily lift the basket off for loading it into the car and just as easily reattach.
831. This is 3 ounces, NOT 3 pounds!  But came on time and its great for travel.
832. This is a good solid wedge. It is durable and wipes clean. It is higher than most which is what I needed. Great prodigy. Really helps my circulation when I sleep.
833. Used in the shower over my cast without getting a bit wet. It is made of very sturdy material. I highly recommend!
834. The picture is not what I got. I got the short ones with the pointed end which are much poorer quality than the ones in the photo with the squared end.
835. African American hair don't know my curl pattern. My hair is thin in comparison to other black women hair. Straightens nicely. The heat is not so direct which makes it great for healthy hair. Not good for styling I had to use my flat iron (direct heat) but I didn't have to use my flat iron as much which helps to decrease the amount of heat on my hair. The Apalus brush is difficult to clean.
836. These were not cut out, took us a long time. Looks so home made.Poor quality
837. useless, really does not do anything. You could put a deodorant stick instead and it feels the same..
838. This number four was a perfect option for my grandsons 4th bday party. The color was perfect for his dinosaur theme. I will definitely purchase more numbers and letters in all the colors. Thank you!!
839. It’s ok. It’s a little rough for my scalp
840. Perfect for travel, and high-quality. I could do without the travel brush.
841. No flavor. Easy to use and store. Easy to digestHonestly, I feel stronger. Belly flat..Hopefully this is a great long time but.
842. I use this frequently.
843. Wonderful product!
844. I use this product for diabetis problems and it works very well as expected. The delivery was pretty quick as well. Will definitely order from this seller again.
845. Have used for years.  Now I have a convenient case to carry in my purse.
846. THE BRISTLES ARE SO SOFT!!! Great for a gentle exfoliation!
847. I do not like nuts, so hard to find a protien bar wo them. These taste good and are very filling....surprising for how tiny they are. Company stuck some extra samples in the box which was nice (hubby had to eat the nut one). The lemon was great and I will order it next.
848. Excellent buy, good product.
849. I've been wearing contact lenses since 1973.  This product works better than anything I've ever tried, particularly when your lenses are grimy from pollution and irritants.  The generics are fine, but the Alcon brand is really the best.
850. This is the best product in the market. I swear by it. Just like the people on the 'my big fat greek wedding', i always say &#34;did you put some glycerin on it?&#34; my pimple.... put some at night - over night it reduces the swelling and makes it ready to &#34;pop&#34; in the morning. i don't even dilute it with anything...
851. These are a GREAT option if you're a Paleo fan and trying to eat only whole and natural foods. Are they like a candy bar like most &#34;healthy&#34; protein bars-no, definitely not and this wouldn't be for you. I find the flavor good, they satisfy my hunger for a few hours, and they are great to have on hand for when you need a high protein snack and need something quick. As they suggest, you really should put them in the microwave for 10 secs before eating. That makes all the difference. They are a bit greasy when you first open the package which is a little odd to me but I just overlook it and dig in. The texture is pretty hard unless you heat them up a bit. The chocolate was my favorite but all 3 flavors are good. The mint is pretty minty so if you're not a fan you likely won't enjoy it.
852. For the price, these will work.
853. These make my mouthteeth feel like I just left the dentist. No pain, don’t need to do cartwheels (floss) the cleaning is thorough and the price is right for 4 in the package.I highly recommend. As matter of fact, I’m back to get a couple more packs!
854. I am very pleased with the results I have seen using this product. My skin looks younger and more healthy. I will order this product again.
855. Loved the balloons, but the tassel banner was horrible. While trying to put it together, it kept tearing and breaking. Really upsetting. Just purchase a banner already put together. I didn't realize that it wasn't already in one piece. Horrible quality.
856. The gel freezes as hard as a rock. This is not a real high quality ice pack. It'll do, but make sure you pull it out of the freezer after a little bit of time.
857. These are my favorite tissues. The cube box is always better than the rectangle! These are soft and have a simple box that's not too distracting.
858. I bought these based on the reviews, but they are not wet enough. My optician said that the wetter the better when it comes to cleansing your glasses. In fact, he recommended a spray and cloth better than any lens wipes, but I'm too lazy to be carrying that in the car, in the house, etc., while wipes can be stored anywhere. This means, I'll have to look for a better product, perhaps paying a little more money. If it's not wet enough, it will scratch your glasses and you will lose that investment.
859. Helps tremendously.
860. A friend recommended this product for bruises. It works! I sprayed the bruised area and rubbed it in, then sprayed a bandage and placed it on my arm overnight. I did that 3 nights in a row and the bruising was GONE! My bruises usually take over 2 WEEKS to finally fade away. This stuff really does the trick! I’m thrilled cuz I hate those “Old Lady Bruises”! They look awful. Now when I bang my arm or hand I’ll just use this stuff. HIGHLY recommend! 😀
861. love the product works great love the different vibrations that you can do
862. The item was used one time and then it stopped working.  It would not turn on, so in the trash it went!
863. The scale is inconsistant and does not correctly measure weight. It has also weighed me as a &#34;guest&#34; on several occassions.
864. i like it. only support you can truly boost back up when it lessens to resupport you. hand pump worked for about a yr and a half and then went. but I like it
865. It's like washing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo.  I haven't noticed any huge difference, but I'm a senior and really can't expect miracles.  The fragrance is VERY LIGHT.  I have a lot of sinus problems, but this doesn't bother me at all.
866. Sorry, not as presented.
867. This works if you can't button your jeans after you have been to an all you can eat restaurant, honest.
868. Have 5 tanks, so it holds up well to a lot of use.  Works well in both sand and gravel.
869. Love this heated eyelash curler, has 3 heat settings. It does get hot. It’s chargeable which is great and comes with extra styling tools. With it hade a case or pouch to carry it all.
870. If you have leaky gut issues, you most likely Don’t have enough Buteric acid and your intestines. I did a lot of research, I’m not a doctor. But doctors weren’t healing me just giving me Band-Aid prescriptions to help alleviate the pain. I started this product after much research and within two weeks, my stabbing stomach pain that was going on for two years stopped. 30 days later I was having healthy BM’s (sorry, but true). I suggest adding fiber “Metamucil” A couple times a day with it and glutamine at night. As well as a good probiotic. 60 days later, I haven’t had any stomach issues and still “regular”. The Key to cure leaky gut issues is to make sure that you’re having bowel movements every day. If you can only get your sugars in your veggies for the first 30 days (no maple or honey either), it’s a great kick off to getting your gut back to normal. Sidenote two, I don’t have sinus allergies anymore due to a bay fever. Getting your gut fixed, fixes so much more. Good luck and I support this supplement.
871. I think that it helps my sleep and cools my body temperature down.
872. Not worth to send back. Just bought by mistake wrong model.
873. I love this product.  As long as you clean them properly will last about two months (wish is was longer).  They work great as long as you are not extreamly engorged.
874. The bottle said the color was grey and it turned out to be navy blue color. It peels off fairly easy also. I just wasn't very satisfied with this product.
875. I had previously bought Wet Stop 3 and had to return it because it would go off on random times when it wasn't even wet. And that was just a month after using it. This one we liked so much better.Pros:Easy to clip on underwearAlarm loud enough to wake up but not scare the living daylights of our sondidn't go off at random timesreally liked that all you had to do to get it to stop beeping was un-clip it from the wet clothing. (Note: some people like when there's more steps to get it to stop because then it's not super easy for the child to just un-clip it and go back to sleep but we didn't have this problem)Prefer the arm band to the chest clipCons:arm band can get a little loose and hard to tightenall in all it worked great for our son. He kept wearing it well after he stopped peeing in bed (they recommend that) It just became part of bed time routine. Just recently started sleeping without it, and he's doing great. If he does start to relapse, we'll start using it again.the armband
876. I bought this shower bench to be able to shave my legs or sit to take a shower when sick. It looks great in my shower, is the correct height for shaving legs and very sturdy.
877. Works better than anything
878. This was bought for Easter Baskets since I had to do all my shopping online due to COVID-19.  Well, I suppose I didn't HAVE to, but I did choose to.  There was very little options for basket grass, and at least this was pretty cheap, but it left bits of pink EVERYWHERE and was a huge mess.  I threw it away the second the baskets were rolled out, and won't be buying it again.  But Easter was saved.  So 2 stars.
879. Soap did not perform as expected and did not last as long as soaps used in relation to size. Scent was mild and not aromatic as I was hoping it to be.
880. This is now part of my gift stock. What a nice way to dress up a book or small gift. Lovely & easy.
881. This handy little hair remover works just as well as the more expensive one out there. It leaves the skin smooth and hair free with no stubble. Makeup goes on so much better. It's quick and easy to use. Great purchase!
882. Great roller bottles to use for essential oil blends!
883. Works just as expected! Perfect size and very cute!
884. The replacement toothbrushes for Philip's Sonic was excellent price & quality & compatible with the toothbrush.  I would definitely buy again when I need them!
885. Works well as a trimmer but is not a razor for close shave.  I recommend it for trimming beard lines.
886. I just needed a replacement part for my broken trimmer and the image and description of this product matched. But the item I recieved was not the same as marketed. It is a brand called Kemel, it is a trimmer that I thought I might as well keep because it seemed to be more expensive than what I payed for. But as I opened the box I quickly realized it was used, with hair trimming still on it. Not only that but the charger cannot even be used in American outlets. This thing is being returned immediately!
887. Spent a week in India. Was concerned about you know what. Didn't have any problems
888. I was more hopeful to have a disposable cup that was better quality.  It is ok, nice black color BUT more "flimsy". I would not order again.
889. The wife loves it. No complaints at this time and will update accordingly.
890. I found this mouth guard several years ago and have been a fan ever since.  I hated the expensive ones the dentist made as well as the boil and fit ones in the drug store.  This mouth guard is comfortable, you hardly know it is there.  It does the job.  I highly recommend it.  Mine last about a year.
891. The scrubby side is so soft, my cats love this all over their tender faces and necks.  esp my older cat!
892. So far I haven't noticed a HUGE difference, but this thing has reduced some of the stank in my car. Recommend for high activitymilitarygymmartial arts types.
893. I did not believe all the hype but my DIL kept promoting this product to me so I finally decided to give it a try. It lives up to all the reviews. I have gotten out old set-in stains. The other day it beautifully removed a blood stain from a bed sheet that I had been unable to get out for months. Was ready to just buy a new bottom sheet. After one washing with the dreft stdin remiver, I put the sheet on the bed. The stain was near a corner pocket. I searched and searched for the stain but found nothing - not even the tell-tale shadow ring that blood usually leaves. It is an expensive product but I will not hesitate to buy more BC it works better than anything I have ever used.
894. Nice tight fit and good optical clarity. Perfect for motorcycle riding as they offer complete sealing all around my eyes and the built in readers are a nice convenience.
895. Even though it smells like old cheese it provides the essential butyric acid that becomes deficient in older people.
896. Love this stuff
897. My doctor says SAM-e deteriorates rapidly from humidity.  He says must buy the kind in individual foil protection.  Too bad, cause these are cheaper but this form too fragile he says.
898. Really terrible product.  Has no power at all.  Waste of money.
899. This scale works quite well and I'm very pleased with it.
900. This does not get warm enough. Despite following package instructions and only hearing in microwave for one min the clay beads started to spill out only 2 days after use. Unfortunately not happy with this item at all.
901. It seemed like it made it harder to breathe not easier.  I returned
902. Stopped working after 1 month.
903. Provides a stream of natural like light where you need it for reading or other tasks that require good lighting.
904. I love the product and wish I could buy more.
905. Not a single strawberry to be had. My youngest loves the strawberry straws & they have become increasingly hard to find in my area so when I saw the chance to get not just that flavor but other we hadn’t tried yet I thought why not give it a try.  I was under the impression after reading the product description & reviews that I would get a variety of flavors. I got 4, only one of which I can’t get in my local stores. Of those 4 flavors, an overwhelming majority is (what I’m assuming to be) vanilla milkshake. I’m incredibly disappointed.
906. I had attach these to two pieces of wood as we had several storms with pretty high winds that blew them off the house. With on the wood I could keep them attached better
907. Came fast, good enough quality!
908. Good product.
909. This is the best one I've tried so far that doesn't cost $100+. You might need to adapt it to your tens unit but it was a 5 min job for me.
910. I was very disappointed because site states they are cotton. They are not!! They are microfiber!!!
911. I bought this because I have arthritis and my tailbone hurts after a short time in any chair. I was hoping for pressure relief, but this is so hard my backside hurts just the same. Also, it's very large. I was hoping that a pillow large enough to cover any chair would be a plus, but it has hard square sides that dig into my legs. And, it's too high. I find I can't sit all the way back in the chair and don't get any back support because of the size of this pillow.I'm glad I tried out the pillow so now I can stop thinking about buying the bed. Now, I have to figure out how to return this because it wasn't shipped from Amazon and I didn't keep the outer box.
912. Scraped my shin down to the bone.  I use these daily to protect my shin.  So easy to use
913. They do the job at a great price
914. They should just take them off the shelf as they do nothing for you
915. I first discovered a hot water bottle while in Kenya on Safari. They put them under your sheets during turn down service, so by the time you get into bed, it is toasty and comfy. This is the first and only time I've experienced this and u knee
916. This vitamin product works great, and I would purchase this item again
917. We used the bags for seed samples with wire tags for ID.  As such, we don't need drawstrings.  Would be nice to have a plain top bag option.
918. i feel like they aren't as good now as they were when the magic eraser first came out?  anyone else feeling that? or is it that i've just come to expect miracles from them? because the magic eraser is the best cleaning product i've ever owned!!!!!!!  everyone should have them in their kitchen!
919. Its a little stiff.
920. I'm wearing a cast for 8 weeks post op for ankle surgery and using a knee walker. These are terrific for not having to leave the bed during the night time. The top seal works well. Recommend getting your preferred aromatic spray cleaner in a bottle so you can rinse with something to get rid of the urine aroma when not in use during the day.
921. functions well.
922. Awesome comfort!
923. This was more like a cream in a tub instead of like a vaseline ointment.  I found it hard to use.
924. Works fine
925. One of the best protein flavors I had! The other ones are better but this one is still pretty good!👍🏽
926. Best tasting protein I have ever had! Hands down!!!👍🏽 Must try at least once! Couldn't say the same about any other protein.
927. These are a great solution for life's little inconsistencies.  Very comfortable and discreet. I would recommend this product.
928. Horrible...left my hair too puffy.
929. Took some use getting use to the routine of taking every night, but now that I have it down I will always take it. Definitely regulated my system!
930. My Ulla worked 2-3 times correctly when I first tried it. Now a bottle of water can sit for two hours and nothing. I just received it yesterday. Very disappointing. I don’t have time to find packaging and mail it back to amazon. It won’t allow me to leave “0” stars, so I’ll give it “1” for the cute pink hearts on it. Functionality “0”.
931. I returned the item.  It may  have worked for just teeth whitening however as a toothbrush it was absolutely horrible.  It was like putting my retainer in my mouth with some toothpaste on it and expecting a result.  Not worth the money! Go with a traditional electric toothbrush.
932. They are bigger than I realized ! But will make do !
933. Elevated toilets are very expensive and hard to find. This innovative product solved my problem and you cannot even notice it's there! My handyman installed it in 30 minutes and I am much the better for it as the old hips ain't what they used to be!
934. Label was different than picture, but I guess it is the same stuff.  Seems to be the same as what I had before.
935. Great for packing light
936. I have sensitive skin and this keeps my hair healthy with NO irritation.
937. I used these once, just to serve spaghetti.  The sauce left a bad stain that I couldn't remove, even after washing  three times.  See the photos.  The plates are very light weight, but they are not rigid.  They are sturdy enough, but you should be aware that the plates are flexible and can bend a bit, so stuff can spill over the edges if the plate is too full.  At $2 a plate, that makes these pretty pricey disposable plates.
938. Good replacement for my Waterpik Model 660.  Easy to install.  The shape is slightly different than the original so it doesn't fit perfectly in the holder but it stays in place just fine.  The handle holds the tip perfectly.  As others have noted, there appears to be a slight decrease in pressure but in my opinion not enough to prevent effective water flossing.  Given the price and free 2 day shipping, I think that it is still worth 4.5 stars.  I haven't had it long enough to comment on durability.
939. I have a Medium size and love it on the plane.  My husband isn't as fond of it -- but then he doesn't like neck ties either!  I think it beats any pillow that wraps around your neck.
940. seems to work great. Have only had it a month now so I will see how it endures.....
941. need to put liquid in a squeeze bottle or supply a eye drop to apply.
942. Good Product!
943. Since our 5 month old daughter was born she has had sensitive skin and we are very cautious about the products we use. With our previous 2 children we did not have this issue so we never bought Dreft products before. I purchased the newborn laundry soap for her clothes and noticed she was getting milk stains on her burp cloths, and bibs. Without hesitation we purchased this stain remover since the laundry soap works so good and does not break her out. This spray is amazing! It will get ANYTHING out of clothes. We stock this spray like its going out of style and I now use it on my 2 and 10 year olds cloths also! The smell is good, and its perfect for anyone with skin sensitivity or allergies. We also use the dreft stain remover pens when we are on the go! They fit perfectly in diaper bags, purses, etc! Definitely recommend this product to anyone with children or frequent stains as it is the best on the market! Now only if there was a fabric softener from Dreft (if there is i have yet to find it!) we would be 100% Dreft users. For now we will just use the free & clear from Downy!!!
944. When I ordered these and got them at first I saw hazelnut and thought YUK!  But when I ate them they were decent!  Being gluten free nothing is "delicious" but we deal.  So I ordered again and got bars that were stale!  I think I will try something else.
945. These work great for me. I have tried so many I wont buy anything else ever again.
946. Perfect for my husband with 17" calves! The size is probably true to chart. My experience was to order larger so they wouldn't be too short, like other brands have been. Just too wide for my calves 14"  but definitely tall enough! I just ordered a sm to try and another pack of lxl for my husband.  Not too thick. Have been washed a few times and air dried... no wear at all.
947. The quality of the bags is very poor. the seams rip open the second you put anything in them.If they were sturdier they would get 5 stars for their overall holiday charm.
948. cant feel pain on bum
949. Started having frequent nosebleeds and I keep one in my car, in my purse by the bed! Hospital charged my Dad 79$ for one of these so this is a deal!
950. These are well-made; however, they did not work for my problem of heel spurs.  well, I gave them 3 stars but changed it to 4 because they are better than i thought, at first--need to use them with boots, like Keens or some other boot--not sneakers or tennis shoes and not wear thick socks because these take up room in your boot.  I always buy my boots a half size bigger than i wear because I put inserts in them.  I have been using another inserts but i developed heel spurs so I tried other inserts out.  At first, I thought these would not work for me, but low and behold, once I placed them in boots with thinner socks, I have had nothing but foot joy and knee joy and hip joy while walking.  I would have given them a 5 star but they squeak a bit--hoping that goes away as they wear in.  Recommended!
951. I bought mine at Walgreens last night. For 9.99 this product is more than a good value. Spins great. Brushes have not fallen off. I have used it 4 times and perfect each time. My face feels so smooth and so clean! I would buy again, and def plan to when needed!
952. It works well, and its aroma is, for me, quite pleasant. Follow the directions and your shoes will revive (at least mine did).
953. I experienced a noticeable improvement in memory recall.
954. The Innate Vitality Krill Oil looks like a good replacement for another company's Krill Oil that was costing me almost double. I have been taking the product for almost 3 weeks now, 2 capsules daily, one in the morning and the other after dinner which is late, usually about 8 or 8:30. In that time I have not experienced any aftertaste, nor have I detected any scent except for a very slight one which is too be expected as all health supplements have their own unique fragrance.The jury is still out if this will help my irregular high blood pressure but I know it will take some time for my body to see the overall benefits but it seems from the research I have done that Krill oil has been proven, scientifically, to benefit your cardiovascular system. I will be ordering my next bottle shortly as they are out of stock right now and possibly go on a subscription basis, if one is offered.
955. I bought this as we are contemplating on switching trees next year.  It made our 2 yr old tree look a bit better.  It was worth the money.
956. Magically delicious
957. Great taste...good value. Powder goes a long way...a little provides a lot of benefit.  Mixes well into plain yogurt.  The tiny spoon in the bag is difficult to use and becomes near useless as the contents diminish part half empty.  Need to have long handle tea spoon handy to make your life easier and far less messy.  Blueberry powder stains for life!
958. I gave this a five star for easy to inflate because I had a special pump from a previous purchase that made this easy.  Without a pump, it would not be easy.  This was a great affordable 2020 decorations.
959. Meh.. I have a respiratory disease and this mask is no more or less breathable than the rest.. the plus side is it won’t fall off
960. This flavor is great, and it mixes up really well. If you are sick of too sweet protein supplements this one is a great option.
961. This is used by my wife to make her E Juice for her electric cigarette(she vapes).  It works just like it is supposed to.  She always uses &#34;food grade&#34; and this brand is that so all is well.  She stopped smoking over a  year ago after 40 years of smoking and I (a non-smoker) am as happy as she is about the change.
962. I can’t believe they worked! I was at my wits end with drain flies ....., Which has only become an issue in my area in the past 2 year’s and I have tried everything.... For sure buying again
963. I really love this product and I'm glad I bought it.  It makes your eyelashes look so good.
964. It’s light is very bright.  Came very fast and packaged securely.
965. Missing 1 and 3 clips are broken...
966. This is my favorite go-to wild rice mix.One time, I couldn't find this brand in stock, so I got the 'Rice Select Rice Blend' instead.  Big mistake and big disappointment, as the first ingredient in the Rice Select blend was ....Texmati WHITE rice.
967. It works great wish I could see the graduation a little bit more.
968. Makes mask wearing much more comfortable for me. Wore on a plane for several hours and practically forgot I had it on! You need to pull the mask down well over your chin, then it doesn't move when you breathe or talk.There are better ones, though. These don't "clip onto" the mask, you just shove them under it. The clip-ons are more convenient, especially if you take your mask on and off a lot.
969. It wasn't for me - the balls were to hard and wasn't relaxing at all. If you like a rough massage then this one is for you. You need some meat on your bones though...
970. My husband likes the zippered compression socks.  They are comfortable and easy to put on and off with the zipper.
971. This is phenomenal.  It works so well to relieve pain across your back and shoulders and actually your neck.  I love this heat wrap.
972. Love this stuff.  It's great for a quick spritz of moisture.  Nice smell, not too overpowering.  Solid pump too.
973. I have a larger than average size face with a little facial hair. This mask fits and covers very well. My only complaint is that it forces my ears down. I would prefer a mask that does not rely on my ears to stay on. That seems to be impossible to find, at least on Amazon.
974. Just what I needed for my sanding disk adaptation to my drill chuck.
975. Perfect replacement part For my waterpik. Couldn’t live without this essential teeth cleaner.
976. Capsule was deflated. I brought the capsule to my Physical Therapist who recommended the device. The PT said the capsule was deflated meaning there was not enough gelatin inside it for the device to perform what it was meant for.
977.  I debated giving this 3 stars because of its big flaw.  I have another derma-needling  device (made in Czechoslovakia) that has the pen attached to the motor via a cord that fully retracts the needles. That one I am comfortable with doing the swiping motions. I do like that this one goes to 2.5 depth. My other goes to 1.75mm depth only. I got this one because it was on vine and all of these devices are expensive. My other device that I paid full price for now has a 2.5 needle depth but that one is $200.00.Derma-needling is really great for collagen induction and I long ago gave up the derma rollers. Those hurt a lot more and typically take longer than a really good dermapen. This pen might take longer than my older device though because I don’t feel comfortable sliding it over my skin.Let’s start with the pros:Rechargeable batteryCordless or wires operationLightEasy to holdI actually like the twist for depth needle depth selectionMultiple speedsIf you use it as a stamp you might be able to get away with less or no serum for the “slip”. Can just put serum on afterwards.Cons:The big one: needles don’t fully retract so better to use this as a stamp turning it on and off again.It also seemed like it wasn’t a full up and down motion each time (you know, like a jack hammer) but more of a vibrate up and down a little and then up and down a bit more. See my slowed down video with needles set at 2.5mm and speed 1.
978. If you want a nose hair trimmer with zero power this is the one for you!
979. first container contained black small particlesa like it was previously opened.
980. nice to have a combination pack
981. NO! Do Not use Magic Erasers on anything! I can't believe they are even still selling any of these things. They serve no purpose and will damage anything they touch. If you care about the surface you are about to clean, keep these things away or the surface WILL be damaged.
982. Love it, works perfectly.
983. Best tongue scraper I have found, and the company is super nice!!  Would definitely purchase it again!
984. The fact that I can still wear the majority of my shoes with these orthotics is great but they also do the job of supporting my arches.  Highly recommend.
985. This protective placard holder is a very well made and thick plastic holder. Unfortunately the new North Carolina placards do not fit this well. The top of the new placards extend higher than the holders hook portion. You can still use it but it is a little more difficult to hang. This is not the fault of the manufacturer rather the fault of the state in its design! It does its job but if you have a new North Carolina placard be aware this will be a problem!
986. Excellent for sensitive skin. Strong but pliable, very comfortable.
987. Product is above average but all kits should include a "includes checklist".  Meaning that there's an inventory of things and an easy way to check off what has been used.
988. This works good. Usually have to buy just the eyebrow shaver for more and I have to worry about finding a battery. This has more attachments and a USB charger. Glad I got it!
989. Handles are too flimsy and bend too much to exert the amount of pressure to cut toe nails.You get what you pay for.
990. I searched for the best fish oil that was easy enough to use. I actually put it into my morning smoothly.  As I really dont see any difference. I am hoping behind the scenes its working.
991. got it yesterday, I am so delighted with this product. I have kind of fine hair. After my hair was washed and dried. Within minutes as a first time user, My hair looked professionally done. Totally excellent, certainly worth the money. I am usually not handy with my kinky curly hair. And I dread washing as I will have to fix it again. (to look presentable) I would give this a 10 star if I could
992. Forget about this if you have trouble with big pills. It's shorter but almost round and the gelcap is sticky. It got stuck and I was choking. I just ordered the liquid. I hadn't been taking omega 3's and my husband kinda pushed it on me. So yes, I should take it, but forget trying to swallow something like this. Mini? nope.
993. Footstool was a great purchase and has been very helpful to me.  It is very steadystable and I feel safe using it.
994. They work great I had trouble before I ordered these strips my mask would not stay n my head. I ordered these connecting strips and I'm. Very happy .
995. Fast shipping and great product.
996. After installing this to my Waterpik and trying it out for the first time there is a slight leak that drips from the handle down the hose.  It’s only a few drops each use but there shouldn’t be any.  Also, I can’t explain why the pressure doesn’t seem to be as strong as the original.
997. Got these socks for my mom for Christmas as a stocking stuffer and it’s been almost 6 months she’s had them and she still wears them all the time around the house. They’re still soft and cute even after being washed quite a lot.
998. just what I needed
999. Absolutely love them !
1000. Washes great
