1. This is good and very moisturizing
2. A great alternative than using bleach tablets.
3. Works Great!  Best thing I have used to remove callus on feet and hands!
4. Doesn't snap shut tight enough.
5. These pluckin' things are great.  I am so tired of the cheapo tweezers that just don't grab hairs or grab them at an angle and chop them rather than let you pluck 'em.The plucking set that I received is smoothly ground on the tips so that they make direct contact with each other and as a result these things are pluckin' awesome.I'm telling y'all, you're gonna love these pluckin' things.  From the moment you eradicate that pesky nose hair, or when you take care of pluckin' away at that patch of hair tickling your ear, you're going to wish you had these pluckers a long time ago.
6. I really had my doubts going into this purchase, but being backed by not only the seller's guarantee and also Amazon's phenomenal customer service in the past, I thought I'd take a chance on this item without any prior experience with anything like it before.I'm glad I did.  And before I started this review, I ordered two more of them.  Let me tell you why...I am a cat owner, and my particular kitty cannot go outdoors because she was born deaf (and she's declawed.)  It's a genetic thing, blue eyes, white hair, look it up if you're inclined, but she's the love of my life and I have trained her with hand signals instead of vocal interactions.Anyway, this should be about the product, and let me tell you, it makes the kitty litter room invisible to your nose. Highly recommended!
7. Cute, but a bit misleading. Colors were on-point, size was not. Instructions were non-existing.
8. Has all the right tools for quick adjustments. Easy to use.
9. Exactly what I expected.
10. I have used KT tape and Rock tape both are excellent but expensive I tried this brand but not again - I must be allergic to the adhesive it has torn my ankle up very itchy and irritated swollen and welts- not happy
11. I bought one of these to simply light candles. The arc spark gets them burning quickly, without the hassle of a grill lighter. I cannot speak to the long term reliability, however it charged easy off my Mac wired keyboard.
12. I use an eye mask and ear plugs every night, ever since I worked night shift years ago. This one sits gently across my eyes, forms and keeps the light out. You can adjust the Velcro strap which I prefer, no metal to press against my head.  Definitely recommend, will be getting more to have on hand.
13. Loved the feel on my feet gave me soft support. Loved them
14. I need to clean my yoga mat for obvious reasons (see picture) I bought this one based on the reviews and went with peppermint because it's a refreshing and awakening scent; it definitely didn't disappoint! I love this and recommend it not only if your beloved pet thinks she owns your yoga mat but also just to give it a refresh from the funky sweat and other nasty smells.
15. Great for when my kids spend the night with family but definitely didn’t work out well for daily use at home.
16. Only one thought - not enough variation on design colors, used as decorator items.  Great product none better.
17. Like the scent when cleaning in summertime and fall
18. Works well, as described.
19. I purchased this for my mother-in-law as she was looking for one for her dogs and she loved it. She is very satisfied with it.
20. Great purchase. Couldn't beat the price with the amount that came with it.
21. This is the silliest product I’ve ever seen.  The material is very tough and it is impossible to follow the directions to put them on.  I waited too long too return them so I’m stuck with them.
22. Pretty expensive for Mr. clean.
23. So far so good, like the way it’s made
24. I noticed that they must have changed the ingredients in The Works. It does not clean off rust build up as easily as it did years ago. You have to scrub quite aggressively to get the buildup off now.
25. Didn’t even cut the hair... very poor quality
26. Perfect case for my pulse ox. Now I can keep up with it better.
27. They work really well but i hate bubble gum flavor. That being said, its not overpowering.
28. Hubby suffers with pain in the back and legs.  He has just started using this.  According to information we looked into, it takes weeks and perhaps months for significant relief, but he thinks there has already been some relief. The directions are easy to follow.  We are looking forward to the increased results with continued use.
29. This seems like a revolution or complete reinvention of electric razors for women.  (Of course, it is telling my age to say that my first one was used in the 1960s, but boy, razors have come a long way.) This one can be used as soon as it arrives, before you even finish charging it, because the charger cord is long enough to permit flexibility of use while charging.  It comes with a type C power cable, but you will need your own type C charger (which I fortunately already have several of). The shaving head easily follows the curves of my legs. The body of the charger is longer, sleeker, and much advanced ergonomically-speaking than the short square-shaped ones of my past. There is a cleaning brush and a carrying case.  I am totally satisfied.
30. Although not the most durable, it did the job.  But if you plan on mailing items using this, I wouldn't get this.  If it's just for gifts that you will transport locally or at your home then it does a decent job.
31. Have not had it very long but seems to be working. Tightens your mussels,easy to use.Just wish the direction were a little better. This is worth the money.Good luck lady's.
32. I use the larger size at home to get the sleep crust off of my lashes. This one is the perfect size for my toiletry travel kit.
33. Fast shipping good flavor especially with almond milk
34. Anti fog effectiveness is marginal and my glasses are now constantly smudged. Cleaning them multiple times a day hoping to totally get rid of this stuff.
35. This does not work for me ,it did nothing.I gave it a 3 star for getting it fast.
36. I have been using this for about 4 or 5 days and have not noticed anything, but I'm going to give it more time. I'm 52 and have bags under my eyes so am hoping this can help with them.After weeks of using daily I have not noticed anything.
37. I wasn't a fan of this because it gave me the jitters!
38. I was sad that I had to send these back because I liked the size and design very much.  Unfortunately these would hardly cut the dogs hair.  I had to press against the fur too hard to get the blade to cut.  Acted like a dull blade, ?  Noisier than my last trimmer. Maybe I just got a bad set ?
39. We love the original Oreck carpet cleaner.  We have purchased different off brand cleaners and they do not work as well as the original Oreck.
40. A must for banana split parties!!! Good quality materials! 3 generations enjoyed the extra special party boats! Our grands hand washed them to reuse again! The umbrellas were ‘recycled’ to their doll house. :)
41. This little guy saved me from having to buy a new microwave!!! The handle broke off of it and my gums and found this cool gadget and it’s worked great!! I was a bit apprehensive but to my surprise, did the trick. Thank goodness!! Highly recommended.
42. Slides around too much on the bottom of my foot
43. Was so uncomfortable, I sent it back.
44. It was all and more than what I expected and arrived in less than 3 days. I am a jigsaw puzzler and it is the only and best way to have enough light. Love it ! LoveIt
45. Bought these to remove mildew stains on boat seats. Didnt get all the stains off, but did a great job removing dirt and grime.Initially, they kept falling apart on me. Little pieces of the sponge were like crumbling off. You have to keep the sponge pretty wet! Do not wring it all the way out!
46. Like this company and the ease of ordering on Amazon where we look for everything. The meadowsweet was fresh and nicely cut. I use it in my chicken coop as part of an herb blend that keeps the nest boxes fresh and free if the pests that like to jump on chickens!
47. I carry this case with me everywhere I go. Fits nicely in my purse. Sturdy, the shell is hard but not solid. I chose this one because it held more oils than the rest I found. I love the color. It holds 58 Dram bottles nicely, Even the ones with rollers. I do not think it will hold the 3 ml bottles. I have that size too.
48. i drink a lot of coffee so decided on buying this. i did not notice any difference on my teeth ..will say since i have sensitive teeth worked out great on that point. but did not see whitening effect using this.
49. This is great for when I get really wound up, tackling too many projects at once, when my body is tired but my brain won't shut down to sleep, and when I can't stay asleep for a good night's rest. I like that it is a natural source of melatonin (plain melatonin is synthesized because it occurs in such small amounts naturally). I take this amino acid with others to support my health. I trust Source Naturals; I haven't found any problems with their products on Consumer Lab's website. I've been taking L-Tryptophan for a couple years intermittently, and daily for the past three months.
50. I have purchased quite a few different supplements and had some free sample sizes from Bulk Supplements over the last few years. Horsetail is a herb I have heard about but never thought seriously adding it to my regimen until recently. Listening to a video on alternative dentistry, horsetail is the go-to herb for healthy teeth and gums. I ordered the herb from Bulk Supplements and began to take 1teaspoon a day. The color of the powder is brown and the taste tolerable. I was concerned about the quality and freshness though. After taking it for 2 weeks I couldn't tell one way or the other if it was having any effect at all. In the meantime I decided to order the same herb through another well known company that only sells fresh dried herbs, oils, etc organically grow, and American made. It arrived today. This new one is like night and day. It is green and smells earthyfresh. It is still just tolerable to taste, but that is pretty typical with herbs. I chuck it back with just enough water to get it down then chase with at least a cup of purified water. So, sorry, B.S. But your product just doesn't pass the quality test with this particular herb. I wouldn't recommend it and I plan on purchasing other herbs from the other company because I know it is high quality.
51. This has helped our 4-year-old son, who is displaying some signs of autism, tremendously!  Since beginning the fish oil, he is sleeping better, having more regular bowel movements (and fewer accidents in his underwear), talking more, playing with toys more appropriately and answering questions without simply repeating the question back to us.  The flavor is wonderful and does not taste fishy at all.  I mix it for the kids in yogurt and they gobble it down.  This fish oil has truly made a remarkable difference for us and we will be customers for life!
52. Just as pictured. Good quality.
53. Bought as Christmas gift...I’m assuming they will be okay.  They seem ok.
54. This gets the job done!  I barely have to file my nails after.
55. These are a very poor fit.  I ordered based on their charts and measurements but the product is much too loose to provide any support.  Not recommended.
56. I had to purchase these because all stores and online sites were put of scotch brite brand. Don't expect these to last more than a few days. The green scrub bad starts to get all fuzzy and fall apart.
57. high quality
58. Returning this order i didn't see anything good in this product. Repeller? I doesn't repel anything. Insects are still coming in.
59. To small to use the elastic band doesn't stretch to get around your waist and if your short like me the middle part is to wide. I tried to use it once but was unable to even use it the whole day because it wouldn't stay on.
60. This machine gave fast reading, not sure if the accuracy for the most part though. Very compact and easy to carry
61. I bought these for my nieces & nephews to have fun with since I enjoyed them in the 70's.  The kids love them!
62. It was smaller than expect it but overall good container to storage rice, beans etc
63. Fit my z2 travel cpap perfectly.  Admittedly I was using it in a more tropical climate, so I can't attest to how well it works in a drier area, but it seemed to help with dryness that I've experienced without it.
64. It is very cute idea! However when I received it some of the letters were coming off. Also some of the letters are straight and some are crooked which drives my perfectionist brain wild. I think I will be able to fix them, but obviously I would prefer not to fix something I bought.
65. Great alternative soap.
66. This is lightweight. It is colorful. Keeps the sun off of my face. I'm able to fold it over to make it a little thicker when needed.
67. This is colorful and lightweight. Keeps the sun off of my face...I used some iron on hem tape to make it a bit smaller.
68. The jar is neutral in color and attractive, but the best thing about it is that I don’t have to strike repeatedly to get the matches to light. The stick-on paper is a surprisingly effective striking surface.
69. Although I try to follow a keto diet, it ends up being more of a low card eating lifestyle. I do, however, have low blood pressure and tend to have pretty large dips after intense workouts. I find that adding this to some water immediately after a work out really helps me to avoid that dizzy blood pressure crash after. I have to rate this product with four stars versus five though - because the taste is dreadful. If there was a way to make this product tasteless that would be great! The taste of this product reminds me of the smell of infant liquid vitamins (yuck) as it is overly sweet and has a metallic taste. As such, I can deal with chugging this down quickly in 8oz of water for the restorative post workout effects.
70. I would equate the energy boost of this product to that of a strong cold brew coffee.... There is a noticeable increase in “pep” upon taking, but - unfortunately for me- the increased energy was also accompanied by a pretty strong headache. As someone that suffers from migraines, I will likely avoid this product in the future.
71. Perfect for a small bathroom
72. This is a nice-feeling, smooth, non-smelly lotion that does well on my 34-year-old skin.  It's certainly not foundation, but it could stand in for a BB Cream.  It doesn't appear that it would be waterproof -- and, in fact, in a deep sweat it starts to run slightly, but I have this problem with many such creams.  Overall, I'd recommend.  As a reference, I would consider myself medium-fair, and the light is sufficient.
73. Love this powder. Put it in your cut flower water and your flowers will last at least twice as long.Great product at a reasonable price.
74. Love these! I’ve been using them on my son since he was a baby and feel comfortable still using them now. I don’t worry about putting them too far in his ears. I can’t find them locally so I order from Amazon.
75. Kinesio tape is great for many physical body scenarios.  I have tried other brands which are not as effective as the Kinesio Tex Gold brand. It is very adhesive and generally lasts at least three days. You can shower with it on, swim, sweat, etc. It is also easy to take off and little adhesive is left on your skin. **I learned how to apply the tape for my injury from my physical therapist, I recommend talking to them before applying on yourself.
76. This is a "vegan friendly" toothpaste with a mildly minty flavor that is reminiscent of peppermint. The mildness means it doesn't have the sting that some other brands have. This MAY also help prevent sensitivity issues that occur with other whitening toothpastes.As for the actual whitening qualities, after using it for a week (2x daily) I've noticed SLIGHT whitening effects, but nothing dramatic.It DOES leave your mouth feeling fresh after brushing however, and my teeth feel "smooth" after brushing.The active ingredient is sodium fluoride at 0.24%, which is exactly the amount in other toothpastes I compared it to.On another note, there is a considerable amount of air in the tube (so it takes a little pressure to release that first squirt).Overall, I'd say this is a decent toothpaste that is mild, and whitens slightly, but it's also pricey, and not much different than any drugstore brand of whitening toothpaste.
77. I'm using this as a light moisturizer, and for that it is perfect. All lotions make my face break out even though I am well beyond my teenage years. This is just enough moisture, and doesn't clog pores.It feels slightly sticky at first, but that doesn't last. The scent is pleasant, and I believe it comes from the ingredients rather than added perfume. The spray pump works well as a mister. It takes a lot of spraying to saturate a cotton ball, so I've been applying it directly on my face.
78. Though the gray color put me off at first, the results were great--soft, shiny hair. The smell is strong, but it  reminds me of a spa that uses a lot of natural products and I like it.
79. Our kitchen (stove, refrigerator and dishwasher) now gleams! This leaves no film behind and it's fantastic on fingerprints. It removes dried food too, though that takes slightly more work. I like that it's in a spray bottle that's easy to aim because my last  stainless steel product was in a aerosol can that made you feel like you were in a cloud of cleaner when you use it---plus this works better than that too. A+
80. These eyeglass cases are very handy and cute.  They fit in my purse really well.  The order came quickly.  I was pleased.
81. I love the taste of these.
82. the adjustable velcro is so long that it  always get's cut in the microfiber fabrics and rips everything apart, very cheap quality!
83. This product is more potent for use than Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate).  These flakes are magnesium chloride and do a better job of relaxing muscles (or at least the effect lasts longer).  This product is also natural and unprocessed.
84. I'm satisfied and arrived as described on time, will buy again
85. Great stuff!
86. I am a repeat buyer of this great product...!
87. I'm happy w the product, the price and the delivery speed
88. I usually use Ayer Gel Nadal Spray when I travel on planes.  It's the best way to fight getting sick from traveling.  Keeping your nostrils moist and breathing through your nose is the key to fighting airborne germs.  I used this nasal spray on my roundtrip flight to Canada.  This spray works well but I had to keep reapplying it.  The Ayer Gel spray seems to coat my nostrils better but this spray works well for daily usage.  I will continue using the thicker gel Nadal spray on planes but I well use this at work and home because it does moisturize my nasal passages when my nose doesn't completely dry out which happens on flights.
89. These are made in China and the quality shows.  The sound is acceptable but not great.  The headphones get hot at times and I am worried about that.  I don't think these are worth $26 dollars but it seems like that is the lowest price going for these.  If you are looking for a cheap headset for a young kid I would get these but don't expect much from them.
90.   These are the cheapest piece of crap you could by.  The sleeve itself doesn't stay in place and the padding inside is a piece of itchy scratchy egg crate foam.  There is no cover on the foam.  I cannot believe this item has gotten such rave reviews.  I will be posting a video to show you the quality, or lack of it with this product.  You are better off buying something else like Futuro which is what I am using now for my Ulnar Nerve issues which have been bothering me both day and night.  The Futuro Elbow Support has been working great and I highly recommend it!
91. I am a type 1 female diabetic with a ravenous appetite.  When I don't take this stuff, I am eating all day long.  When I take these supplements in the morning and afternoon I eat much less and take much less insulin!  A win-win for me.  I do not use the shakes from Advocare, they are too sweet and have too many carbs.  I use Syntha 6 protein powder which tastes much better than the Advocare shakes.  I also like the Advocare Spark.  It gives me energy and helps me focus.
92. Not the tastiest but not nasty either.  I really like this and feel its effects right away.  I breathe better, my wounds are healing, my chest is clearingmy fluid is not retaining, kidney,urinary tract and bladder infections are now just distant memories.  Sorry I'm not balding 'cause I know this would fix it.Seriously though, this has many uses for different problems so give it a try!
93. I remembered this alcohol scent from when I was a kid. Our home was filled with extra stuff, too much to fit in a medicine cabinet so this was on the 3 tier shelf just outside the bathroom. This was a different alcohol with a great scent. Years later I found it again in a beauty supply store and still loved it and used it like I did regular alcohol. I'd also apply to my underarms, instead of deodorant, when I'd be home to help keep me smelling fresh and feeling cool.
94. Wouldn’t cut worth a hoot ! Scissors kept falling a part . Took over 2 hrs to cut a Yorkie and the dog was being good but the clippers just wouldn’t cut ! Got a set of WAHL and they are great !
95. Worked 1 time. After that, never worked again. The big lettering "Made in China " right on chargercord should have tipped me off. For the record, this is my first one star review in years, if ever.
96. bigger then I thought.
97. I've been using this tumeric for over a month now and its a good product.
98. The problem is that if oils leak, you need a new insert of foam rubber.  I need one.  I put tin foil in the oils where oils leaked.  Otherwise, love the case.
99. It definitely does it's duty. I add a scoop with my laundry pod and you get an extra clean
100. Short handle, soft brush. Chinese label printing.Not labeled for sale in USA retail stores..
101. I am writing a review of the ChillMED brand. The Travel Bag I bought was defective to the point where I want to warn others: These are not made to last.This is a horrible product made in China. I bought it in February. After 8 months it is literally falling apart. Rip Off! Buyer Beware.(The MedPort brand products are even worse...)The &#34;nylon&#34; fabric is cheap, thin, and coated with something that is flaking off inside the pouch.The outside fabric attracts dirt and is difficult to clean (Porus, canvas like nylon material.)The stitches are pulling out and elastic stretched, pulled and fraying.Had to throw it in the garbage because it has become unsanitary, unable to be cleaned by wiping...When new the pouch inside had to be resewn because it was too loose to hold in the bag of syringes.The grey material stains easily, relative to a black material. Appears dirty after a month of use.Horribly Overpriced.Another example of people with medical problems being overcharged because they need it.Sigh...

103. Great taste good and useful on the road.
104. I thought it was Lysol.
105. The pad is perfect for the pain in my hips when I sit.Thank you
106. Soft and natural.  I love it.
107. Great to have this box!
108. Great love it's the perfect height.  Light weight but sturdy
109. Wife wears all the time!
110. Bought these as a gift but was able to try them out. I think that it was weird but worth trying out.
111. It’s ok. I use it for my injuries in the shower. I need something a little more rough. This is nice to keep your skin soft with daily use. I rinse off with cold water to prevent a rash, but using anything with friction on the skin can cause irritation.
112. I was nervous ordering these but they came perfect for my items I sell. The color is accurate and bags are not to thin. Great for lip gloss
113. At some points I enjoyed this but using it as hoped to sit behind my head while I’m driving or safely parked during lunch. The strap didn’t hold up the unit in place like o wanted to and this soon dropped too low to stay up from the elastic band wearing down too fast and not way to tighten it down
114. I have only been taking it about 2 weeks but It seems to be working well. Thank you for your good customer service!
115. Ok product for the money. Disinterested like the new cables
116. I love that I could get them in the quantity I did
117. They are ok
118. Worked Very well ! After gum surgery, light weight, easily placed where needed without adding more discomfort! & They R PINK!
119. These gloves do exactly what they're made to do: protect your hands from dirt, grime and water. The gloves are comfortable; however just a tad too big. I have long fingers so the length is perfect, but they are a little baggy. No worries! They still work well for washing dishes and general cleaning around the house. Be sure to note that only the teal gloves are flocked and the pink and white gloves are not. I'm fine with either, but that may cause an issue to others.
120. I like the scarf it just doesn’t stay in place the way I thought it would.
121. I have been able to reuse them, it is a tight squeeze putting them back togetherBe careful, they do not fit all bottle inserts
122. These meal are great , and filling
123. I  am the most skeptical person and ordered this on the spur of the moment, desperate to find a good multi along with minerals, etc. After a week, I  could feel the difference in my body. My focus is much higher and I  am exercising again. Sleep is way better. Changes are happening day by day. It's been two weeks and this is the good stuff. Buy it.
124. First off, I bought this product for my grandmother who was diagnosed with dementia almost a year ago. I had seen it as a lightning deal and decided to try it for her in addition to her medication she is currently taking. I must say I do think the product seems to help her. I know it can be tricky writing a review on a vitamin because just like medication, everyone reacts differently. I have seen days where she is really good and sharp  almost like her old self and yet she has some days that are not so great. I feel this product has helped with her mood swings and her cognitive functions. I do recommend trying this product but it doesn't work over night so I wouldn't expect it to a 'miracle' vitamin. My grandma has been on this vitamin for a couple of months now, and I'm pleased with the results I have seen for her.
125. Yookat Medical Arm Sling- This arm sling looked good in the photo, so I ordered it. It is evident it is made overseas, and the instructions for use were difficult to understand. After figuring out how to put it on, I realized it is made to immobilize your arm. And I mean totally immobilized. Others may find this sling comfortable, but I did not. It was painful to wear, so I had to return it. I ended up purchasing a standard arm sling at a big box store near me. This was one of those purchases where I needed the convenience of a local store to be able to try on a sling in person and trade it in if it didn't fit, without having to mail anything. I found a standard sling that worked find for $15- at a local store. Amazon is still amazing, but some things are best purchased locally, depending on your immediate need.
126. The ones I received looked ancient. They were returned.
127. THIS JUST WORKS
128. Got this today and the instructions state to pour the powder into your mouth, but, gosh, it’s absolutely awful.  Due to it being fish collagen, the fish taste is definitely there and the so-called green apple flavor isn’t.  I could barely finish the packet. I will try to add this to some orange juice, to cut the flavor.I will update this review if I notice any difference.
129. Looks like a real person. This hot chick does my dishes, laundry and house cleaning for free and does a great job at it. I no longer let her do the cooking because last time I let her cook she cooked she got to close to the flame and pop!!!! So I called 911 and they saved my little lady.
130. This stuff smells great but it lasts ten minutes and it's gone. I'm giving four stars because it smells so good, but again.. It won't stick around no time and you'll have to spray more.I believe it's the sprayer partly responsible for the fast fade out of the smell. It sprays such a heavy amount, it falls straight to the floor immediately as opposed to suspending in the air for a few seconds. The sprayer is not adjustable either. It's simply too much liquid coming out of the nozzle at once. Period. Again, it smells great though.
131. I did not get the deal as advertised on TV.
132. Very good product!!
133. I really like the shape of the product it's easy to hold and works great
134. Great product... good price... love the multipack... will definitely buy again in the future. Once you go Scrub Mommy you'll never go back! I also suggest that you purchase the Scrub MommyDaddy while round holder that you can mount in your kitchen sink (the one that is createddistributed by another company).
135. Grainy, does not dissolve.  it's like sand in the bottom of a cup
136. these work fantastic. Great shipping. all tools are nicely beveled. No burs. works great an highly recommend the set for different tools to have one always handy and ready.
137. Just what I wanted! I own the battery operated kind and always wanted the electric for more power. It does what its supposed to do.Very happy with my purchase.
138. Holy Sand Paper! I won't be using these on my baby's perfectly soft tush. These things feel like they could take the skin right off.
139. They're great!Recommend
140. Full disclosure: I totally thought this was a joke. I saw the image in the description of the ironic hipster holding a green smoothie and thought this was a &#34;soylent green&#34; type gag gift for your literary friends who like a dark joke. Turns out this is actually a legit meal replacement powder. Boy I feel silly, having a giant tub of neutral flavored Slim Fast sitting on the counter forever now.
141. I live this new flavor! I have gastroparesis these definently help with the not normal nausea we experience from this condition
142. Bought this as an alternative to fresh wild blueberries to add to the Medical Mediums heavy metal detox smoothie!
143. These are great! So beautiful and you can feel the quality of the grit on the files themselves. I’ve owned quite a few brands of glass files before and I’m so glad I found these.
144. Arrived with a leak in the bottle
145. This is a rather large product, but I like the shape and how it can stand up on its own on the carpet. It has lights on it that fluctuate to different colors, but if you are using it when you are sleeping, the lights can be turned off. It has several different levels of use and you can turn it on high to get the most heavy air cleaning. Seems to work well and it's easy to remove and clean the filter.
146. I was really glad it was already assembled. I'm glad I got the wood instead of the plastic. It is well made and should last for a long time. I thought it would take a while for my body to adjust to the positioning of the legs, but to my surprise it worked just like the said it would. I'm thinking about purchasing one for my mom. The real trial will come if I have problems going. I'm glad I got it.
147. I really really love it, perfect  size and I love the color.
148. Box was unsealedopened when it arrived.  Want a refund
149. A bit pricy but great forThe Patriots fan in your life.
150. They eat them most of the time when they are fresh.. Many times they are dry.
151. I tried this product for the first time. It smelled very good but the  sensation I did not like. Maybe it was the mint and that irritated me. I could not keep it on more than 20 minutes. I have them to my daughter and she loves them
152. I like that these BCAAs are vegan, flavored and contain glutamine. The apple is pretty good. It dissolves good enough to not leave chunks or blobs of powder, but it doesn't turn sheer. In total, these are pretty good, not perfect, but I've had much worse. I do think drinking this helps with my workouts and muscle building and healing.
153. The limeade is a great flavor. It mixes well and tastes good with other flavors. It does have a weird smell that I can't place. I don't know if it's the coconut water, sucralose, BCAAS, or something else. It's not unbearable or even bad, I just don't know what it is. I would also like to know more about the quality of the BCAAs and how they are derived. This is also sweetened with Sucralose which isn't my favorite. Otherwise, I would give this five stars.
154. This review is for the vanilla cold brew flavor. This is so good. It's one of the best tasting whey proteins I've tried. I usually add a lot of extra stuff to my protein shakes including cinnamon and extra vanilla. This is great just on it's own. Cold water, frozen banana and this protein is refreshing and satiating all at the same time.The flavor is great, and this is also a whey protein that I can feel good about with all of the quality ingredients. The package is large too. Some of my other protein powders look about half full when they are brand new. This bag holds a lot.
155. Can’t smell the scent
156. This product needs no soap. It contains cleansers and a calming lavenderchamomile scent. Great for  a quick wash. Fabulous for any kind of travel. Easy to use.
157. This is the best of the critter chasers I have tried here. Easier to install and seem to be louder. Extra star: come with documentation for maintenance and battery replacement. Waiting to see how long the rechargeable batteries last. This is my second purchase of this set.
158. These were so cute.  I feel I get a good, clean feel after using them on my face at night.  I give 2 thumbs up.
159. Awesome pain reliever alternative to OTC and I can take it everyday without worrying about liver damage. Last all day of pain relief. I used it daily, one cap in the AM & one cap about 4pm. One cap is sufficient for light pain. Takes about an hour for it to work with or without food.
160. helping someone who is unable to get the drops in her eye without the dropper touching her eye.  This works fantastic with the single dose dropper and she was able to administer the drops herself.  It worked so well I ordered a second one for myself.
161. 3 stars for whitening  I only used it twice and not sure yet..it does however have a very minty sent . Love that it comes with 2 me and my husband are giving it  a try. Update a month later I have not used it continuously so I cant say but even just the 1 time using it it works decent I have to say I was pretty suprised.
162. The smell is a bit weird... however, I am so fond of the fact that it is a silky, lotion consistency and not a nasty, stinging oil ! This product is great, but you may wish to wash your hands after using it ! Or add a medicinal, therapeutic grade, quality, Organic, essential oil fragrance to it.... in order to mask the scent ! Over all though... I highly recommend the product. It works FAST !
163. I thought I was receiving a larger size, so when I received the very small bag that I paid over ten dollars for... I wasam quite disappointed. The amount I received... is worth about 5 dollars MAX. I got ripped off... because I was in a hurry and not paying close enough attention to the ounces. So, be forewarned... IF you make the purchase, you will be receiving a very SMALL bag for over ten dollars.
164. It's OK… it works alright, but it is NOT powerful at all ! That part of the description is deceiving.
165. Easy to make and great tasting
166. This tincture was suggested to me and I'm so glad! I'm detoxing and there is no aftertaste to cry about. This is a small company that obviously takes pride in their product! I will be checking out other products! Very good product.

168. Hi,I purchased a large container of berry lemonade. I do like it. I only wish I know the source of color. It's blue. I'd prefer a more natural color.
169. Works great  no issues
170. I got this for my daughter's nebulizer and all the stuff that goes with it. The stuff barely fits inside using both side pockets and I thought it would all fit in the main compartment. I only got one lock because I thought this we have 2 toddlers who keep messing with the stuff so that's why we got the bag and the lock. I can get another lock but when I get a refill on her meds it won't all fit no matter what I do. The picture is misleading and the bag smaller than you think it will be.
171. I have not received this yet but it doesn't make any difference. This is the best on the market, trust me I know because I have tried them all. It takes half the time of scrubbing, and I use it every day. Things that you think are ruined wont be anymore. The price for this 8 pack puts all the other stores to shame. Unless you have a triple coupon. But you can only buy one. Trust me I am a neat freek. Type A, so anyone that understands this  you know how important it is. I love this Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. You can't go wrong! Thanks, Florida Deb.
172. I absolutely LOVE these prerolls. First off, they are made out of natural cotton cellulose, water, and glycerin - all natural ingredients - NOT plastic - and they smoke sooooo well!! I highly recommend purchasing ;)
173. In my opinion, these pre-rolls work just as well as their more expensive competitors. Definitely a great buy, especially if you want to save few bucks
174. Cap leaks.Hate the taste. I hope it us as good as u say.
175. Have to have helps with COPD
176. These are completely inedible.  Way too  stiff to eat.  If you try to heat it up in order to soften it, and heat it for just a little too long it puffs up and smells horrible.  Do not recommend.
177. One of the finest whey isolate protein powders available.  Fantastic for the lactose intolerant.  Flavors that are some of the best I have ever had.  This one is for the Chocolate.  Best Chocolate ever.
178. I always try to expand on my Syntrax Nectar line at home.  It's just that this Lemon Tea defies all principles of it's category. It's so ridiculously good!  The Lemon Tea is "chuggable".  A full array of flavors awaits you.  This is my favorite, 10 tubs later.  I have taken a liking to the Green Apple as well.In the past 2 years I tried about 14 flavors from 6 different companies now offering similar-sounding fruit  clear or "non-milky" whey isolate products.  Not one even comes close to what Syntrax Nectar has achieved.They also have a line of "Naturals" sweetened with Stevia for people who prefer this sweetener.  I am not a big fan.  However, the Orange, Fruit Punch, and Natural Peach of this line get great reviews.
179. Hubby really likes it
180. It is pricey compared to other older eating sprays, but that's because it is what you'd expect for that higher price. I really appreciate that quality.
181. Purchased this to add in a smoothie recipe.  This is fantastic flavor and I am sure packed with major nutrients.  I would definitely recommend to someone who makes smoothies all of the time.  I put a teaspoon in blender with frozen cherries, banana, orange juice and it was spectacular.  Will purchase again!
182. Works exactly as designed!
183. I had never used a pumice stone before, so the fault is mine. I should have ordered a finer- grain stone. On this one the little holes are so big they are not gentle to my feet.  However the item arrived on time and as described.
184. I bought these for wearing in a room with older people who like the volume turned up on the videos we seelisten to. I got to where I hated being there, the 30 minutes of loud volume left me with a headache every time and I found myself wanting to just run out of the room and go home! These ear plugs are very comfortable and I believe they will work just fine. I got the small size and I like how they will not be visible given their clear to opaque color. Yesterday I realized having earplugs in when I dry my hair makes that experience more tolerable also so I am quite glad to have these. I definitely recommend these. 😊
185. I really love these night shades, and sleep well with them
186. Just as pictured and described.
187. We wanted a first aid bag that we could fill for our dog. Its roomy and just what we needed.
188. This flavor is scrumptious, very soft and creamy, almost feels like a full calorie, full sugar dessert, but without all the carbs and sugars. Very satisfying to me. just remember to warm them in a micro for just a few seconds that's the big catch so don't plan on using them for on the go unless you leave them someplace warm where they will stay soft.
189. These bars are awesome. Just warm them up in the microwave for about 12 seconds and they are melty and soft. I love that I can have something sweet that doesn't Spike my blood sugar. They're chewy but that causes them to work well on my appetite control because I've chewed so much I feel totally satisfied.
190. It's expensive but it works! Definitely going to keep buying
191. Colloidals and nano particle minerals are great, wether you are an alchemist or not.. Be careful using them with any medical issues, especially copper, but if u utilize them correctly you can expect amazing results. Read up on them, & there are plenty of good knowledgeable people & actual Doctors and Scientist on youtube, that provide a plethora of great information and proven research on the different ones available, and the one or ones that are right for your personal situation.Blessings..
192. This is my go to “I feel like I got hit by a bus” medicine. I like that it’s a hot liquid and not a syrup that burns going down. It helps me feel better, and to get comfortable enough to get some sleep. The taste is pleasant- you can’t go wrong with honey and lemon with a sore throat and congestion. If they ever stop making this I’m gonna be in trouble.I LOVE YOU TheraFlu!!!
193. Love this file, hard to get in stores.
194. Great pill organizer.
195. More energy, kept me focused. Used this before workouts and work on computer.
196. I got this hoping that it would take care of a stress incontinent problem that I sometimes have, but have use 5 of them and still have not found it to take complete care of the problem.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  Will keep trying to see if &#34;user error&#34; is a reason for the product failure that I have experienced.
197. This is my favorite tissue.  I suffer from allergies and when the season is at its worst, I need this tissue to keep me from getting a sore nose.  This is a wonderful tissue!
198. My doctor told me to try taking Magnesium to help me sleep.  This product did the trick!  I get sleepy about 1 hour after taking this.  It also helps with digestive problems (remember Milk of Magnesia?).  Highly recommended.
199. great tool!
200. Moved a lot and did not feel helpful
201. Hardly any suction. Don’t bother purchasing. You’re better off with a manual pump.
202. Works for sore muscles as well as face roller.
203. Just wasn’t for me.
204. Small leaves less mess but don’t do it drive you get headbox instead of razor bumps
205. Love love love this product !
206. I like the pliability, length and sturdiness of this.
207. I do not like it this brand. It comes on at barely a touch, the cord is short and the speed is not what I am use too. I will not buy it again or refer it. I wish I could of sent it back.
208. I figured I'd try the Vanilla since I do like a couple of other flavors but this flavor is awful, it doesn't even taste like vanilla.
209. This was a nice back support, but the straps would get to loose due to the material and it sliding on my shirt. I also got to big. I am 5'5" 150lbs and got XL. It does depend on your Jean size on most measurements I would say not just weight. I am an 1113. XL was to big and I couldn't tighten it on my own. It comes with an extender for the waist part so I wouldn't be to concerned about it not fitting to tight in the tummy.  I just would rather have something super tight to make me stand up straight. It is a nice back brace if you get the right size!
210. I purchased this through a health food store.  I do have a coupe of sensitive spots on my scalp and it has managed to calms those spots of my scalp.  It does not take days to calm everything down, it only takes seconds.  I will buy this product soon.  It also eases the itching of my scalp and as far as I am considered this is a miracle.I did not know this product existed.  I found this while searching the supplement aisles at the grocery store.
211. I bought two of these for gifts. I was worried about the pressure being to hard based on other reviews but its great and can be adjusted. Everybody loves them. Yes buy it!
212. My 4yo had a saliva rash under his lower lip for nearly two months that wouldn’t go away. Pediatricians (two) recommended aquaphor and hydrocortisone cream, and neither worked to clear up his skin. The rash is gone after applying this lotion for two nights.
213. Perfect. I bought this to carry fertility medication in to and from work when I needed it. I’m using to transport breast milk tofrom the NICU a year later. It’s just the right size and keeps stuff that requires refrigeration cool enough.
214. Wonderfully fast delivery. Ordered it yesterday and received today, less then 24 hours, amazing.As for the mask it fits my husbands face, which is amazing. He’s 6’5” and it’s hard to find anything to fit him. Regular masks pull so hard on his ears it’s painful and with it being required to wear masks everywhere now a days he stays home. With it being adjustable he is so much more comfortable he tried it on today on his way to work and is so happy. The only downfall is the nose area not having a tight fit and will probably fog up his safety glasses, which he has to wear along with masks everyday at work. I’m looking into a couple of possibilities to rectify this problem. I gave 4 stars because it fits without causing pain, I subtracted a star for the fact that I have to make some adjustments to ensure it’s a mask he can use.
215. It was pretty purchased for mother in law but was stolen shortly after she received it so don’t know how well it would have worked
216. These are very nice. Lots of capacity and such a pretty color.
217. I love this eye mask. It is very soft and very comfortable to wear.
218. These drops stopped the stingingitching immediately upon first use. I’m pleased.
219. Just received this!Right off the bat, it is working.My digestiveautoimmune issues are too numerous to delve into (tmi), took this yesterday afternoon and this morning, things are moving along already!This is the first time in years that I have not felt “stalled out!”
220. Wore this on flights in January when flu season was rampant. Finally stayed well —no flu or URI. First time flying without getting sick in three years
221. Glasses sparkle again and sink odors are gone. YAY 🎉
222. Can’t live without this stuff! Have given bottles to at least 6 of my friends and family! Works 100%  better than any of the 20 or so other products I e tried. Thanks for making this winner !!!!!
223. Overall an inexpensive bottle for a small quantity of capsules for taking occasionally. The capsules are transparent so you can see the acai supplement you are consuming, no fillers or mix-ins. No after-taste for me with these.
224. we go through a lot of chickpeatos, they are good for snacks to take to school, road trips, etc. Make sure to bring water, as you will feel thirsty after eating a bunch of these.
225. This is one of my most favorite healthy snacks. I used to be able to order it in bulk through my grocery store but I moved to a new state and Amazon is the only place that carries them. The description is a little misleading, because you get 12 bags instead of one. This is the best price I’ve been able to find anywhere!
226. One of the two pill organizers is small and the other is large. I ordered two of the large ones, but received two different sizes. Annoying. Last time I ordered two and got two of the same size.Otherwise these GSK pill dispensers are nice - better than the cheap CVS version. Although the CVS dispensers take less turns to open. These GSK organizers are better for traveling (more sturdy).
227. We love Dreft, and this product helps with the tough stains! We have used it on everyone's clothes and I am so pleased with the results. It works well when used with the detergent.
228. I only wish the doors would spring all the way open, but I like that they rest open unlike many other pill boxes.  It seems sturdy at day 1!
229. These little bags are the perfect size for portion control. They work great!
230. This fish oil has a very pleasant taste, so it's easy to take.
231. I use this product in everything from smoothies to oatmeal, to pumpkin custard for extra protein. I highly recommend the Paleo Egg White Protein.
232. Tears easily.  if you wash your floss to reuse, you won't like this.
233. Fresh, light, and almost nutty tasting.  Did not activate my gag reflex-- and mine is sensitive to over-activating.  I'm using this for morning swishing as a daily oral hygiene habit instead of oil pulling with coconut or sesame, which texture-wise never worked well for me.  It helps to have a tongue scraper if going with this method.
234. Excellent for allergies. Unlike the the over-the-counter meds, these herbs have no side effects.
235. Fabulous, would buy them over and over again!  Barely feel them, good looking, Scojo rules!
236. Thank you!
237. I used these to hang tissues balls decorations from the ceiling.  We did have a couple decorations fall down, but most stayed up.  They were on an acoustic type of ceiling panel.  They weren't able to hold lighted Chinese lanterns very well from this ceiling though.  We ended up not using the lanterns because these dots couldn't hold them.  The good thing about these glue dots though is that they cause no damage to the wall or ceiling that you use them on, but they do have a limit to what they can hold.
238. This saved me money compared to the disposable pads that the pups like to tear apart.
239. I find my focus increased and my energy way up when I take 2 capsules. I appreciate that the ingredients are listed with amounts rather than a proprietary blend of ingredients.I’m a huge fan! I also noticed my appetite greatly reduced.
240. Great Stuff.  I can tell a difference in several bodily ways.... will not elaborate... but this change is more than in anything else I have ever taken.  I am 71 yrs of age and one thing I will elaborate on... my recall memory is better...  and it can't be coincidence,,, it's been bad for so long and now after taking several containers of this... I can tell a sizable difference.  Now I don't take it but only about 4 times a week and only 1 large scoop full.  As per my weight and directions, I should be taking about 2 scoops for a dosage.  I always tend to think they suggest dosage as max and I am not inclined to maximize dosage.... thus I take one large scoop when I take it.  Which makes it go further and I still get results.Thank you amazon for allowing this price to be affordable...  it's about at the top of my priceline and am grateful for that
241. I am on my third canister of this product.... It is really good... I mix mine and let it sit for a minute or two to let it all dissolve thoroughly... also improves the taste.  The flavor is quite pleasing (and in my opinion is better than the peach flavor) and I can tell that I feel better taking it.  Once a day, usually, I take one heaping scoop (scoop is in the canister).... it goes further and does make a difference in how I feel.  I don't take the full recommended dose because I figure I want it all to be absorbed without any waste... and usually items such as vitamins, etc will give you a max dosage so that you will replace more frequently.... as we all know, nutrients just leave the body when over taken.  Since this is mixed with liquid, it absorbs into the body more readily than a hard-packed pill.
242. I can stand on this scale in 10 different places around my house and get 10 completely different weights.  I have no clue how much I weigh with this scale.  Cheap and not worth it.  Spend a little more money and get something that works.
243. Not bad but is slightly too low for me in lateral position. The customer support seems helpful though and suggested to try two pillows on top of each other. I will give it a try.
244. During the holidays packaging is everything. Great bags for small packagws
245. GREAT WILL PURCHASE AGAIN
246. Best protein on the market!  Use for long runs.
247. Bought as part of a gift for a soap making kit and it was well received. A little bit makes a lot of soap so this was a great value!Update: Still 5 stars! Made soap regularly for 6 months with these before finally having to order more! Fantastic lather and has made great soaps.
248. I use this as my daily probiotic about a quarter cup a day and it has a wonderful taste.  I would recommend to anyone.
249. I am now buying ALL of this line and just have to say, it is the BEST thing I've bought on Amazon. I am not kidding. Let me explain. This is has a lovely light scent that just SMELLS AMAZING. I don't even just use this on myself, I also use this on my smelly chihuahua.  She loves it so much she's always trying to lick it off of my feet. Oh, that. I put it EVERYWHERE. Now no smelly anything after exercise, or from sweat, or anything else. I even dilute the body wash and use it as air freshener!! I wish it were also a cologne. If they would just make this scent in a shampoo, cleaning products, just everything they'd make with this scent and this ability to eliminate odor, I'd buy it. It's  a WOW product!
250. Neither this kit nor the Belly Buster kit have any snacks at all.  SO that's a major price increase. Same "price" but you're getting 25% less. The other kits have 5 breakfasts, 5 lunches, 5 snacks and 5 dinners.
251. I've bought several of these kits, and I finally figured out why this isn't working for me. A lot of the breakfasts and lunches are very sugary bars, which later make me feel like I'm starving - I think it's the sugar. For one thing, a granola bar, in my opinion, is a pretty lousy breakfast or lunch. Not very filling, and not much nutrition. Then after you eat these, you crash from the sugar high and are starving. I ended up eating eggs on the days that I was supposed to have the bars and I have bars left over. Weight loss was zero.  I lost on Nutrisystem before, but that was when they had artificial sweeteners. For those who want to know, this is low fat, low calorie, high carb, high sugar.  I do like most of the dinners.
252. These glasses have fantastic style and seemed sturdy. I had to return them, though, because I had trouble seeing out of the clear upper portion of the glasses. It was really distorted for me. Hopefully it won't be for you!
253. Perfect for our white elephant party
254. These help to keep my feet in place and a lot more comfortable.
255. I have been going through menopause symptoms for the past year.  After tearing my poor husband's head off and anyone else who came close I locked myself in my room for a whole day and did research to find something that would make things more manageable.I found this root from Peru called Maca.  The Red Maca is supposed to help with  menopause symptoms, end hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings.  It also gives you a boost of energy and mental clarity.  I already have thyroid issues and I need all the help I can get.I got this Red Maca powder on Amazon because it had the most and the best reviews.  After about a week I started feeling an energy boost after drinking it.  I felt better and mood swings calmed down.  In two weeks my husband started looking a LOT better!  One bonus is that is helps out in the bedroom too!!!  Ha ha!!!I've taken it every morning for the last 3 months and it has made me feel so much calmer.  Things don't ruffle me as much. I am a really anxious person but even that has calmed way way down.  I truthfully don't think I've ever been this chill.Last week I forgot to take it for a few days.  I woke up in the middle of the night with hot flashes.  I took it the next morning and the hot flashes went away.Just read the reviews and see what you think.  I use the powder but you might want to use the capsules.I like to mixOne Tablespoon of the Red Maca PowderOne almost Tablespoon of Cocoa PowderCinnamon to taste ( I love cinnamon so I use a lot)1 Banana1.5 cups of Almond MilkI hope it helps you as much as it has helped me
256. We been using it since 2016, the Germ Guardian GG1000 7” Pluggable Small Air Purifier  and it works!  We use it in the bathroom never had a problem with it.
257. They might have more Omega-3s but it's really hard to see any actual effect vs other pills.  These aren't quite as big as some but not as small as others.
258. It says to put in your favorite drink.  I was drinking generic diet soda, so I put a packet in.  It really didn't mix well at all.  There was actually a lump of it in the bottom of the cup.  So maybe they should be more specific on which drinks it can go into.
259. It looks like chicken or turkey gravy but when you put it in it is cold for a while, which can be nice.
260. They're pretty basic and work fine but there are a lot of them so it's a good deal.
261. This is OK but not great.  It says not to use your finger but it doesn't have an applicator so I guess you're supposed to use a tissue?  It burned a little when I first put it on.  Later when I had to wipe it felt a bit numb, so I guess the numbing property does work.  I don't really like it as much as some of the name brand ones I have.
262. Especially since my mom had a busted ankle recently this is good to help her get around a little better than the traditional walker without as much bulk as a wheelchair.
263. It's pretty big but otherwise fits well.  You need a filter with it but I had some big ones that fit better than what was included.
264. This is a decent mask as far as I can tell.  Once you put a filter in it's thick and it's pretty comfortable to wear.
265. Too big for any of my masks--and I have a lot of different ones.  It split into two parts too which I'm not sure if that's intentional or not.
266. This is pretty easy to use not that I've seen a big difference.
267. It fits my toilet well enough.  You just have to remember to push down the bottom for more room for the water and sitz stuff.
268. I don't really do smoothies or juice often but sprinkling some in coffee sweetens it a little and maybe it does something good, though I can't say for sure.
269. It works a little but not great.  It's mostly green tea, which I've used in the past.  There's some other stuff too but nothing revolutionary.
270. These are OK but not as good as promised.  These particular ones have kind of high arches and even though they're soft and squishy they don't really protect your feet that much if you're on them all day.  Of course as someone with diabetes my feet aren't all that great anyway so maybe for more normal people they help better.
271. So I found this product not to be that great, my hair got tangled in it many times and also it did not heat well enough to make nice curls, even after it was charged, so I return it
272. these are great we are still cleaning after the fires here in california and these are non toxic and work great to remove the soot and ash damage thanks so much!
273. Left a film on my mats and the scent was not pleasant. Just my observation and opinion.
274. Reading all these reviews and they look and read like the SAME reviewer....🤔 don't ya think? Strange .... so....be cautious.
275. So, this is not regular powdered horsetail like you would normally buy.  This is 7%, so that means they add extra extract, which is going to make this stronger and extremely bitter. Since I eat my herbs like food, I don't want this extra extract added to it - the taste is overwhelming and bitter.  Plus, it's not green.  Good, fresh, dried horsetail powder is supposed to be green.  This is also from China.  I normally get my powdered horsetail grass from Starwest Herbs, and it's organic and from Croatia and tastes wonderful and fresh.  This stuff...tastes gross, wrong color, not organic and from China.  I bought this because it was cheaper than the Starwest, so I thought I'd give it a try.  But totally not worth it - you get what you pay for.  I'm going back to the more expensive horsetail from Starwest which is exactly the way horsetail is supposed to look and taste.  I like BulkSupplements normally - for supplements and amino acids, vitamins, minerals and chemical-type stuff.  I highly recommend Bulk Supplements for vitamins and supplements their quality is good and the price is excellent.  For herbs, I would recommend Starwest or Frontier - definitely not BulkSupplements.
276. Add a couple of tablespoons to a cup of hot water, and add a tablespoon of butter and a tablespooon of MCT oil.  You'll be going like the energizer bunny on meth.  If that's what you want.Only thing is that it will turn your teeth brown.  Just to complete the speed-freak effect.Or you could just be a normal person and use a teaspoon like they say.  In which case, it'll just turn your teeth brown, without the energizing effects.For me, it really didn't do much, unless I used it at very high doses, and then it didn't feel that great, and the crash was not fun.  Love the deep, earthy, strong taste, though.  But you might not.  Most people that are used to lab-created tastes don't really like the taste of nature's medicines. So although overall, I'm not a big fan and will not buy it again, I really can't give less than 4 stars, because it does work.  Better than coffee, which just gives me a slight tummy ache and nervousness.  Better than that hideous 5 hour energy stuff, which makes me feel like I need to check myself into a mental ward (anxiety, shaky nerves, racing thoughts, verging on paranoia...yuck)So if you're looking for a new energy source, give guarana it a try.  Or just take up running.  That's what I did and I feel better than I ever did with any of these energy supplement, and I've tried them all, from all-natural, to lab-created chemicals.
277. It only removed a little bit, the newest dirt. I did it several times, followed instructions, left it several hours, and removed barely 20%. Mine was not even close as what they said, and it looks pretty bad still. The pink metal sponge (braso) did more in one scrub, that this in 7. I threw away the rack, and the rest. This is not worth it at all, a waste of $20.
278. This is SO easy to use and only takes a few minutes per batch. Very good quality colloidal silver produced. I highly recommend this silver generator.
279. Best product ever for cleaning shower doors.  It is simple to use & there are no spray fumes to inhale.  My clear shower doors remain clear for months after using Brite & Clean with just daily scrape downs using a squeegee.  I've been purchasing from my local True Value store, but am thrilled to see it's available on line.  I've gifted it to friends because it is that good.
280. So easy to dust furniture without long edges of a rag trailing behind. I love that my hand can grip curved edges and get each and every single bit of dust.
281. Yoders is the very best Apple Cider Vinegar. I take it in the morning, chase it with a beverage. It truly helps with digestion, shrinks the gut & keeps you all around healthier.
282. This product is sweetened but not flavored, so it just tastes like faintly salty (from the electrolytes) sugar water, but NOT watermelon, grape, orange, mixed fruit, etc. I doubt dogs would mind the sweetness added to their food, and cats do not taste sweet well, if at all. I have been using this to great effect with my picky eater elderly cat who has Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with chronic diarrhea. I just add some of this to whatever he's having. (I firmly believe feeding him raw meatboneorgan has kept him alive, since his brother died of the same condition before I discovered raw feeding. I also add ground psyllium husk to help solidify his poop.) Anyway, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for rehydrating sick or chronically dehydrated pets.
283. I have very small eyes, so I haven't been able to find an eyelash curler that works for me. I had very high hopes for this product. But, it doesn't curl my lashes at all. AND, the first time I used it, I used it too long and my eyes puffed up from the heat. I guess I actually burned my eye lid. It also says to use after applying mascara in the directions, but when I tried this, my mascara came off. Like I said, I really wanted this product to work for me, but it just didn't~
284. I needed something to keep my medication and vitamins in. This is the perfect size, and I can see through it to help me find what I am looking for. I do wish it had a strap on it instead of just a handle on the side, but it still works so well.  It is also much sturdier than it looks, as the plastic is thicker than most plastic bags.
285. No pinching and curls easily!
286. Well you don't even have to have arthritis to appreciate how easy this can opener is to use.  My 87 year old mum could not use the old can opener but has no problem using this one.  Extra blades are a nice addition too.
287. Product is as described and come with clear instructions on the back side of the packet.  This product is for one application and must be used as soon as it is opened.
288. Works better than the $60 scale it replaced.  it's very accurate.
289. Shipped without the spray head attachment. Product works great
290. good to add to my 1st aid kits
291. Love the product but my tin arrived in a dented box with no packaging inside. Lid of the tin was also dented. Disappointing. I want to take the vitamins so I didn't want to have to send it back and wait for a replacement.
292. Love this blend.  A word of caution, it is MUCH sweeter than sugar.  So you can't swap it 1 for 1.  But my 1lb bag lasts quite awhile.  As far as low glycemic sweeteners go, this is my favorite for baking and making iced teas.
293. Bought this for a sprained ankle because I am spoiled and refused to use crutches. Anyway, chose this scooter because it was on the low side for a "next day delivery" scooter on cost and there is a basket, and the basket is metal. There ya go. This scooter ticked all my boxes so I purchased. Very pleased. Delivery was truly next day and it worked very well. I'm sure I will be lending it out to family  as needed for many many years to come.
294. I bought several packages of these for a wedding luncheon. Handed them out to ladies attending the event - on our back lawn - to keep their shoes on the grass instead of sinking into the sod. Sizes are all same height: small is for very thin stiletto heels. Medium is for a standard high heel that is still slender and large is still for a slender high heel but for a slightly thicker size. Most ladies needed the medium size. All appreciated having these for the event.
295. I bought a package of two because I was trying to approximate the Facia Blaster (not available on amazon at this time) and hoped this would work just as well.  Probably would have been workable except for two things... the octopus top has a face and the nose part of the face is pokey when you're grabbing the top and trying to &#34;blast&#34; your facia with it.  Also I had only been working for about 5 minutes when the top of the first one unscrewed and when I tried to screw it back on again (these are two piece massagers that you screw the top handle part onto the bottom fingers part) it was stripped and would just spin in a circle and come off again.  Could'nt be secured in place.  If this were a solid single piece construction and a smooth knob for the top it would have been a GREAT option for facia blasting.  I think I'll just end up buying the actual facia blaster.UPDATE:  I had been giving up trying to approximate the facia blaster and was about to buy the product but I had been hearing from youtube reviews that it was taking a long time to arrive and I didn't want to stop efforts to blast while waiting waiting waiting.  I found a DIY facia blaster online and decided to make one and these little guys are just the ticket.  Hooray.  Here's a link to the DIY project tutorial:http:www.wellnessgeeky.comhomemade-fascia-blaster-alternative-diy
296. Love this brand and seem to feel better (digestion and energy) when taking this product.  My liver needed some help and I plan on ordering more when I run out.
297. no fragrance at all and they are tiny
298. Highly recommended!
299. I know there are more expensive, fancier and more touted moisturizers... yet this works for me.  Simply wonderful.  My hands and body love this stuff.  Also, much easier to use with the pump version.:)  I may refill if such a thing exists.
300. The temple width is about 5 38 inches.  So for people with large heads (like mine) rejoice.  I am tired of getting the Dollar Store readers so my hope is these will last much longer.  The spring temples are perfect.
301.  I'm so pleased to have this good looking, ergonomic, cordless spray mop. I have hardwood floor throughout of my house. Every time cleaning entire floor with my old cleaner is like a big pain to me. With this mop, cleaning becomes super easy and fast. You'll see how effective and easy it is to clean my floor with sprinkled flour by watching the video I took. In addition,the cleaning pads are machine washable.
302. Fits well and keeps me from losing my glasses all the time.
303. I commend the seller, Magickal Night the shipping was quick, and arrived earlier than anticipated. Likewise they very safely packaged the item, which is encouraging to purchase from them again!7 Sisters of New Orleans Glory Water is what it is, a mass manufactured spiritual product. 7 Sisters of course is one of the 4 or 5 other “brands” that IndioWisdom owns, which originally were small independent companies. Therefore there is a caveat to their item, e.g. formulas got standardized between brands (some things smell the same, but have different packaging). However, these “specialty” items aren’t as terrible as I’ve found, likely because if it’s a unique item, then there isn’t some cost effective equivalent to sell as a dupe. This may also be why Wisdom’s own website has listed Glory Water as out of stock for almost a year (if not more).The sent of Glory Water is nice, somewhat sweet and cologne-like. Unfortunately the scent easily dissipates when it’s sprinkled or dabbed on anything.Overall I’m not dissatisfied, and is a nice addition to my spiritual supplies collection.
304. I like the toothpaste no fluoride, it cleans and whitens however it has sodium benzoate
305. I started using this product back in november and it has only been a few months and the iron has stopped functioning. It does not get as hot as it did in the first couple months. It simple stays warm but not warm enough to iron your hair. Save your money and time and invest in an iron that may cost a little more but will last much longer. And the return window they provide is not long enough to test out whether or not the iron works. Very disappointed.
306. Works well with all smoking parts. Worth the extra $2 to get the cap holes for stems and bowls.
307. I typically drive 10-15 hours a day for work. I bought this cushion to help with the pains I was experiencing as a result of my work. Not only did this cushion do nothing to ease my discomfort, but it actually increased my discomfort into pain.Before using this cushion, I took 5 minute stretch breaks every 3-4 hours and I worked 12-15 hours. After using the cushion, I had to take a stretch break every hour and I could only sit for 8-10 hours of work a day.Seriously, I am super disappointed in this cushion. If I could give negative stars, I would. I contacted the company to let them know that I was displeased with this product, but they wouldn't refund me. Now I'm stuck with this overpriced, lint-magnet gel square that's good for nothing.
308. it was exactly what I ordered large enough to put all of my essential oil and more.lightweight and easy to store
309. Callous remover works well but epilator doesnt work.
310. Screwdrivers are what I was looking for. The nose cushions are EXCELLENT! Other stuff, I imagine, will be helpful on an as needed basis. Would purchase again.
311. Wife and daughter use and are pleased, what else can you ask for.
312. actually daughter loves it.
313. Slowly body parts are looking and doing better.
314. I recently discovered that if you use Bar Tenders Friend on your stove, let it site on the stains for about 5 minutes, the Mr. Clean erasers wipe away tough spots.  It takes me about 10 minutes to clean the stove top.  Using a paper towel or regular sponge, I would have to apply a lot of elbow grease and a good 20-30 minutes to clean it.
315. Perfect for those who are trying to quit!! Great flavor.
316. These saved my gallbladder- I took them until all symptoms cleared, had my gallbladder checked and I was stone free. THEN I had another baby and for some reason my gallbladder likes to make stones during this time. Didn’t have issues right after the birth but began having issues again and started up on these and had helped tremendously! Nothing else has worked like this for me! My naturopathic doctor got me turned on to these and I’m very grateful!
317. This product had noticeable positive results for me and seems to be a quality product at a realistic price. This is a product I will buy again.
318. Love this stuff, it tastes good and mixes nice and easy with water. Been sipping on it throughout the day, and drinking it in my workout water and post gym hydration.
319. The lamp directions show a screw to hold the lamp together but none was included so it falls apart.
320. Represent real Christmas tree even if I have  fake
321. I literally just got these in the mail today and have been wearing them for all of 37 minutes.  This review may not be in its final form.Since diving head first into my 40s, I've discovered arch support and foot comfort is everything. I bought these thinking I could wear them around the house in my Woolrich slippers.  So far, so good.I'm posting photos of how much I had to cut these down to fit. I added an arch support insert, then put these on top.  My feet aren't pushed and falling out of the slipper, but I can tell they're not quite as snug as they were before the modifications.I'll update this, if I remember, in the future.(Haflinger slippers are supposed to have the best slipper arch support, so I got a pair.  Meh. Not very high support. Would be good for people who don't need a lot. I think I'm going to enjoy these FrankenSlippers much better. Really, I wear Vionic around the house when it's not freezing cold outside.)
322. The foam is much easier to clean..!!
323. It is great for drying hands and certainly more hygenic.It is good for company to use also rather than guest towels. Just use themand dispose! Don't know what I did without it!
324. I like how this makes me feel , great stuff.
325. that the wipes are thick and not thin.
326. Got to my house faster than expected and is exactly what I wanted. I would reccommend it to anyone, thank you
327. I looked at a lot of canes prior to purchasing this one. The bells & whistles were a little over the top in the beginning but became quite functional, useful and helpful. There isn't a better cane out there for the price. My only wish would be to offset the handle to make it a little more comfortable over a long period of time.
328. good, saw results in about a week
329. Energizers are always a good choice.
330. I really liked it. I gave it to my family member for them when they buy their new home
331. Great Product, Great Company !
332. Wonderful way to store multiple brushes.  I wonder if they have a stand like this for DESE razors?
333. It’s an okay ice pack. Gets too hard once in freezer for more than a couple hours. Not my favorite.
334. If you want to stay healthy without vaccines the TF will do it.  I have taken it faithfully for years and would not be without it. People around me get the flu, get colds, get shingles, etc. while I stay well.  This supports the immune that God endowed us with.  Much less expensive than doctor bills.
335. This product is awful!  I’m a cheese lover but this product should NEVER have been a choice for anyone. Could I send it back or get my money back PLEASE?
336. At first I tried to resist buying a sound machine. We had an old broken radio tuned to static, but it kept getting electrical interference and making horrible buzzing sounds. So I finally bought the Dohm and don't regret it. I did notice though, since it moves air to make noise, it cooled our bedroom slightly. Great in summer, not so great in MN's cold winters.
337. Great buy for vaping use. I have used it for over a year now with no complaints.
338. I am a fairly regular Soylent user (the bottled 2.0 liquid).  This is the previous version, the dry &#34;you mix it, just-add-water&#34; version.It's not bad provided your expectations are set beforehand.Even after copious shaking in the bottle, there is a slight grittiness and texture that is nearly non-existent in the 2.0 pre-mixed.  The flavor is different as well.  The bottled 2.0 reminds me of the leftover milk after eating a bowl of Cheerios.  This (v 1.8 dry mix), the flavor is more akin to pancake batter.  Which is fine, as long as you know that going in, and don't find the taste of pancake batter unappealing.All in all, I prefer the taste and convenience of the 2.0 but can picture taking this on hiking treks where you are pumping water from a stream along the way and don't want to carry the weight.  It should also store longer, seeing as how it is a dry mix.  Great for putting away with your emergency supplies I would think.
339. This product absolutely DESTROYED my sensitive areas, I can’t believe this product is marketed for babies, I’d never EVER put a baby through what this did to me. Chemical burns, completely destroyed me, almost went to the ER. DO NOT BUY.
340. I have used this product for years as a supplement to my diet and my active lifestyle.  Unfortunately, it is not vegan so I had to stop using it.  If your are not vegan I suggest you try Fruitein before other similar products.
341. From what I have heard described about other rolling machines of this type, they break easily.  This one, which is made of hemp plastic, I am sure, will last a very long time, and it's very easy to use.Love it!
342. awesome for my homemade deodorant, easy to push up and convenient.
343. It is way too gentle.  I ordered this massager for muscle releif, not gentle personal pleasure.  I gave it tow stars because it was not broken or not working at all.
344. Excellent product, give me a great workout, have no regrets
345. I used this when I had walking pneumonia. I was still sick for 2 months while using this. Maybe it works better as a preventative instead of after you are sick.
346. This lash curler has  teeth  along the silicon. They seem to help with after mascara lashes. It separates them and gives a more natural look. Really affordable and does the work. Comes with multiple replacement which is appreciated.
347. I heard of sea moss awhile ago and been searching for them in supermarket but no luck at all. Therefore I turned to amazon and surprisingly this particular brand has many 5 star reviews so I went ahead and bought this.It look genuine and promising from the packaging. Upon opening the bag, I found bits and pieces of things that were confusing at first. That was only a tiny bit of the sea moss I took out from the bag.I did a little research and read all of the question and answers on the amazon page regarding this product. The seller mentioned that this sea moss originate from Indonesia (previous edited from Philippines)The colorful threads and strings are plastic. It is not surprising at all if these sea moss were farmed near textile factories. These very thin plastic threads are made from melting of plastic and making them into fine threads and then into clothing. The finer transparent plastic threads clings to the sea moss for their life. It is almost impossible to get rid of every single piece. You will see what I mean if you soak it.Also on the packaging ITSELF located on the back states ****** &#34;CAL PROP 65 WARNING&#34;. This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.*****This indication is NOT pointing to sea moss causing cancer BUT The substance that is in the sea moss that comes from waste and heavily polluted areas. I have am pointing out what is clearly stated. I LOVE sea moss but this particular brand contains dangerous chemicals that causes cancer. It horrifies me even further because Indonesia is no where near safe from the FUKUSHIMA spill. All of the area of the Pacific ocean contain high level of radiation due to the spill. Sea plants are highly sensitive and will absorb these radiation. That's why sea food from the Pacific ocean are much cheaper compare to the Atlantic.As always do your research and watch out! Better safe than sorry!
348. Keeps the bladder and kidneys working.
349. So glad to have found this supplement in a large quantity at a low price! It is the exact same supplement I was getting at my drug store at a much higher price!
350. Great product!
351. Love these little drops.  the taste is delightful and they work when I have occasional "gas".
352. This stuff tastes great and gives you a little energy boost
353. This weekend I had 4 sheep sheared with this unit. It worked out very well! Since the sheep had not been sheared for over two years, this unit really cut through the wool nicely. We would take a break periodically to allow the unit to cool down, but it got the job done nicely! I got the unit from ebay for 53 dollars, and I am very pleased as to how well it worked.
354. Doesn't matter how I feel, because its good for you...Alittle bitter but hey...Not everything good for you will be how you want it.
355. Great I will purchase again.
356. Love these containers!!Will buy them again for sure!!
357. Gave my car the best shine it ever had. As far as getting it off, since I hand wax my car I only leave a thin layer on each section for about 2 minutes and then I remove it.
358. Product was received on time and in great condition. I’m a satisfied customer. MLS
359. Great kit for the price!
360. Bought them for my grandma ( a non mobile senior).  They are too small to put them in the bes before going to sleep. I saw reviews that they work but now I'm looking for a bigger size
361. I got it for my mother in law and my self. We loved it because it's long and our sleeves don't get wet and it's comfortable.
362. Its really good i am using every day good for health
363. its really good
364. I’m allergic to the adhesive on medical tape....except this one. Its gentle on my skin (  my surgery was on my face) and this not only held all day, I never got a rash or ever felt uncomfortable after hours of having it on my wound.
365. Great for cake pops
366. It wasn't difficult to install works perfectly fine
367. No side effects. Not too large and a fairly neutral taste. High quality ingredients for added nutritional insurance to a person's diet.
368. I found it to be useless for me. I have a cracked tooth. And the bristles on the toothbrush wasn't hard enough for me.
369. Super cute and great material. My son is 2 and wiling to wear it so must be comfortable
370. First, let me start off by saying I did not have this for more than a night. I returned it quite quickly. It smelled quite toxic, which possibly could of faded with time, but I was not interested in waiting for that. On top of this, I just wasn't comfortable for me to sit on. It's quite firm, and it raises you a bit more extensively off of whatever youre sitting on than I thought. Just not for me, plus it's rather expensive.
371. I bought this for my teenage daughter and she says it worked out very well for her hair. Her hair is curly and wavy but the drying works really well and she is able to style her hair accordingly. There are three different measures of heat and she finds the medium and high features to work best for her. Overall,  Great purchase so far.
372. These work great!
373. Overall like a lit. Would like it to be bit larger but is accurately portrayed. Seems like should hold up well.
374. Good stuff. Order many times & feel that it has helped my hair grow!
375. Maybe for small bust but not for full size. Tape came off not sturdy durable and not wide enough.... just a big roll of band-aid tape.
376. Every thing great
377. Great fit and Great price and fast delivery
378. Came in as advertised
379. I was very honored that I found that item. On my first child, I was not sure what should i do with her nose. She is crying I was so nervous. But my 2nd child I found that item. It is a lifesaver. It works quickly you need only a few seconds to sock your baby nose. I will highly recommend
380. Works best on clean glasses. Slick packaging.
381. every thing i needed
382. Is not working for me. I use too and I am steel with fog in my lents.
383. You can not beat the price for the amount of hydrated water you get!  You can buy at the grocery store and by the time you add up the amount you pay, you will save so much by buying this and making your own hydrated water!  Not to mention its delivered right to you with Amazon and no need to go to the store. So glad I purchased! Will be buying again for sure.
384. only one instead of 4 to a pack which is way too high for 1
385. Best straightner EVER. But harsh on hair. gets hot fast cold fast and lasts a long time.
386. It's amazing. U blow smoke in and none comes out without any odor. It's great! Works how it's supposed to!
387. Useless horrible desirves a negative star.
388. This my second brush I purchased but this brush takes too long to heat up and I had the temp on 450
389. Its awesome. I gave one pair to my husband he like it an relax and enjoin...
390. Good but dont know why you cannot ingest.
391. It is what a expected. Scent isn’t very strong but it coats well and does the job. Keep it in plastic bag so it doesn’t  dry out. Glad to not be buying plastic throw always. Will buy again but waiting to see how long this will last so far good over a few weeks.
392. Have not used that much and went to use it today and it gave an error which I think is associated with the band not inflating.
393. Didn't helped.  I donate it.
394. Does it work? Probably notDid it have some placebo effect? Maybe a littleWould I buy it again? Definitely notThanks for coming to my TED talk
395. I highly recommend this walk Air purifier works extremely well specially if you have a small room
396. I thought these would be perfect for selecting my favorite sneakers and playing golf in them. You have to be careful what sneakers you use for this and anything with air bladders is NOT recommended due to puncturing and also your sneakers are design for a sure footed response with their current soles so when you add these cleats they can be very uncomfortable on your feet when the ground is hard and dry. Not so bad when it’s wet and soft. Overall. I lost more Than I would have liked and so I have to give these a clear thumbs down
397. I’ve bought others but this one fits hand better when applying vs those that feel like they are size of baseball mitt
398. These are very convenient, and good products.
399. The herbal infusion’s strength killed any odor on the pad. Also, the remedy gave a cooling sensation. I would love to exclusively use this brand.
400. Leave this product in your shower. While the water is still running pour the oil onto your body and rub it in! Also pour some oil under your running bath water! This is my absolute go to oil!
401. I make my own DIY yoni steam blend and this herb was the icing on the cake!
402. Have you ever been in a public restroom where they've run out of soap?  For some of us this is a nightmare, and this little  item is an answer to our prayers!  They are very convenient to have in your purse and one sheet is all it takes to get your hands nice and clean.
403. Super cute and be warned that these are a bit time consuming to put together but well worth the time!
404. it takes at least two wipes to completely clean my glasses of smudges. worse, the wipes smell like Liz Taylor White Diamonds, so strongly that you can taste it. I cleaned my glasses, washed my hands, and left my apartment, and I could still smell the fragrance lingering while I was walking down the street. these will not be a repeat purchase.
405. the motor isn't very strong, but honestly it doesn't need to be. do NOT use the sandpapery attachment on your face, you should never exfoliate with anything that rough. great value for the price.
406. Love this...get one!
407. The space is great, but it’s small enough to fit in the small pocket of my purse! The design is gorgeous and exactly as shown. Exceeds my expectations!
408. It hardly collects any lint.
409. It was exactly as it described. Thank you
410. They are filling
411. I seriously don't think these items travel well! The scale is inaccurate and changes every single time you step on. Some days I weigh 60 and other days I weigh 150. Returning this item
412. Everyone needs to buy this!! It feels fantastic! Like a massage at home. Totally recommend!!! Also came with a little wood comb.
413. I chose these cases because of the way they look and having the tools with them in the case, therefore I could see my contacts through the top. To my surprise the cases are NOT LEAK PROOF!!
414. I am one of those people who wears my shoes without socks a lot of times, so needless to say, my shoes get a little stinky. I just spray this into them before I put them on, then spray again after I take them off, and this stuff really helps the shoes to not get that sour foot smell. The only thing I dislike is that the scent is REALLY strong, so I have to take it out into the garage to use it, otherwise it makes my closet smell!
415. I use Readers and they are always smudged. Nice and Clean are the only wipes that will clean my glasses fast and easy without leaving a greasy mess. Just wipe and their clean.
416. Good Product. works wonders for my daughter's uniform for work.
417. It’s  best to have extra magnetic clips for your CPAP straps. Good buy!
418. The scent is initially very strong but as you put it in the drawers it decreases to a goo scent. I love the lavender smell so this is the product for me. If you do not like lavender do not buy.
419. Good product
420. I love these but Tge are delicious… the price is too high here I can buy them at CVS for 14 the price
421. Hemp goodness!
422. Did not leak great purchase for what I needed
423. Works amazing on my Pandora jewelry but the cleaner does smell like eggs. As long as u rinse off the jewelry after using the cleaner, the smell goes away and they look amazing
424. These are amazing. I use them to drive through the Canyons. And they are extremely helpful they also help you to stay calm and not get anxiety because you can't see the oncoming cars with their bright lights I recommend these to anybody especially truck drivers or anybody who has to work during the night
425. The fit works, very snug. Not as much force, it’s a slight notice of power as the “brand name” replacement heads but just as good for the price.
426. I was so happy to see something pretty for an 80 year old birthday party.  These were reasonably priced, very soft and quick shipping.  Definitely use them again.
427. One broke after about two weeks; I will see how the next one lasts.
428. This is a good product. It seems to provide good protection.
429. Was two weeks from expiring.
430. Excellent quick roller!  Load paper and tobacco, lick, close and poof!  Magic!
431. Great stuff!
432. Remote worked great
433. The first one that I received was completely DOA.Would not work At All, so I requested Amazon to send me a replacement.They very kindly did so and upon receiving the second unit.... More disappointment.After adding brand new batteries, it would not turn on. I fidgeted around with the lid until it finally was able to make good contact and turn on.But the blades spin SO Slow that it barely cuts any hair at all. It more like pulls your nose hairs *OUCH*And worse still, the metal head gets hot pretty quick which makes using it extremely uncomfortable.It is sadly, the worst trimmer I've every tried. Please look for a better option and save yourselves the hassle.
434. This product is a life saver for my Dad! No spills and no more risk of falling in the middle of the night when he wakes up to urinate.
435. No problems with the order.  It was shipped quickly.
436. I like it but too long squeeze pump inflate.  I had injury my neck and spine. I feel like support sort of some my neck helps inflate.
437. Looks exactly how it’s pictured.A little pricey but it’s nice!
438. I purchased wrong size but item was good.
439. I used these before I gave birth to collect colostrum and take with to the hospital. They worked great and did fine holding up in the freezer. You can really put a date on them, though, so that part was a little frustrating. Tape didn’t stick and you can’t write on them.
440. Very easy to mix into a shake or just water.  I usually mix mine into my morning glass of water.  Definitely noticed increased hydration.
441. Great curling iron
442. They were the Perfect Christmas Gift for my Mom!She loved them! The Fit was great for her skinny chicken legs.  Quality was good and as expected.
443. i really like them compared to other mask including the ones I made!
444. Great cheap droppers love these things
445. Too big still for my 11 year old. Need to make these in even smaller sizes.
446. Not what I expected. Lining too light for me. Maybe for a jogger its fine, but offers no no protection.
447. Really hard to use. Even can’t install for Benz cars
448. Very cute. Not amazing quality in stitching of masks and smelled funky when they arrived. Smell went away after washing.
449. The product is awesome but the sellers sometimes cut the fabric into multiple pieces giving you a small cloth to use be careful.
450. They are just a little bit too small
451. Case Is well made and safely stores heady glassware at a bargain price.
452. Love this bag for the beach
453. Awesome! It's just what I was looking for and it really works relaxing my muscles.
454. This product is very quiet you don't know it's on. The price was right with the $30.00 coupon. It also has a 2 year warranty that you have to register before 30 days after purchase
455. I can’t give an honest opinion because my doctor prescribed a larger dosage than the OTC brands.
456. Easy to use. Makes oiling my scalp take only half the time it used to. I love how it’s sealed up so you can make the hole as big or small as you like. It is nice and big so I can make a large batch of my personal oil mixture and not worry about it for a while. I have saved a lot of product by being able to put it exactly where I want and not havwing it go everywhere unnecessarily
457. Cleans very well and doesn't leave a sticky residue. I ordered the rose scent and it's lovely - not too powdery or musky. The company also followed up with instructions on how to use the spray. Will definitely repurchase and recommend this product.
458. Good for reading when outdoors. Cute but not high end. The lenses are not very smooth and slightly uncomfortable on the skin
459. Nice unit but you can only set both leads to the same strength.  So if you have them in different locations they are still the same strength on both lines
460. Awesome & cheaper than almost all other & just as good!
461. Works great!
462. By far, out of SO many masks I’ve purchased, the best mask ever. I don’t have an exceptionally large face but most others, aside from the paper masks, leaves my double chin (!) so obvious. This tucks under, goes high, has the metal piece for the bridge of the nose and allows you to unfold as much or little as you want. Expensive but so worth it!
463. Kind of difficult if you have thicker hair like I do. Personally, I still prefer my round bun maker. Thin hair may be able to use this with little to no difficulty.
464. I love that they won’t able to slide off my glasses!!!
465. Good for pain
466. Product does what it is suppose to do, however, for some reason I kept thinking it was made from silicon. Not a huge deal, just though that.
467. Awesome earplugs. Worked amazingly at a heavy metal show, where I had to be next to speakers in order to film the event. Gave me the ability to communicate with another videographer, while also being able to hear the music and crowd I was shooting.
468. I got this set about a week ago and my kid's eyes lit up when they saw them.  The enjoy playing with them a lot.  Spikes on the balls are not sharp but give good sensory feeling.  The ball is light, squishy and bouncy and the rings are more heavy sturdy built but still have some flexibility to it.  I kept one set for myself to keep at my work desk (to squish & smash) when I'm thinking or dealing with some stress.  My box came with the 3 balls and 3 rings all in the same 3 colors: Green, Pink, and Blue.  The box does show Orange and Yellow options so not sure if those are random or what but what I got matches the pics in the listing.  When I first opened, the new 'plastic' smell was strong but a week later, the smell has faded away and not a problem.  Overall, good quality and very useful.  I can see these being used and lasting a long time.
469. I love the container and how each set is individually wrapped. They work well and are easy to use. I like the fact that there is a pair that is waterproof and moldable.
470. We've only used it for an hour or so but it seems to work well.  I really like the added hotice packs and think they are a great addition.+ Easy to put on and adjust.+ It has a little pocket on the inside to hold your pack of choice.+ Heavy duty fabric
471. High quality and super nice feel! Works perfectly
472. I have very oily skin, and had to wash my cushion daily and change it monthly or it wouldn't seal. I thought I would try these to see if they would help. So far they are working well, there is a bit of air leakage and I have to have the straps tighter, but there is none of the annoying noise associated with the leakage. I also haven't had the skin irritation I sometimes get with the silicone cushions. They seem like a less expensive alternative to changing my expensive cushions. My only criticism is that they are not custom made to a particular mask, and that the opening must be hand cut. It would be nice if they would custom make them to fit the popular masks.
473. great buy! perfect size for a variety of uses. the included earplugs are nice too
474. How these inserts could offer anything resembling comfort or support is beyond me. Basically you're getting just a small bit of foot shaped foam with some slightly raised oblong modeling on the surface.Paid half price with a discount code...that's still way too much.
475. Great quality case that snaps shut with a magnet. Plenty of room for standard glasses. Lots of headroom.Interior Cavity Measures 6&#34; x 3&#34; by  1-34&#34;.Gonna buy another one.
476. Bought this after seeing the mattress on a youtube commercial.Was sitting on a rock hard office chair, so instead of spending a fortune on a whole new chair, I bought this!Man, is it comfy! My poor butt and tailbone are thanking my brain for the purchase of this seat cushion ^_^Now i REALLY wanna buy the mattress, especially after my friend bought one and i test it out. Soooo comfortable!
477. Total waste of money.  Does not work at all.
478. These glasses are great overall with one painful exception; the nose pads.  The pads themselves are the thinnest I've ever seen on glasses and provide very little cushioning.  To add to this flaw, the pad arms aren't able to support even the weight of the glasses and are always bending.  When the arms and pads are properly positioned, which is rare, these glasses feel uncomfortable on your nose.  They are always bending, though, and literally become little daggers cutting into the bridge of your nose.
479. This came in handy for our last camping trip. I love it! The scent is not too overpowering and it keeps the sun and bugs OUT! I wish this came in a larger size.
480. Very sturdy, great price. Everyone at the wedding was jealous, as they were all sinking in the mud
481. hehehehe good size for my needs
482. Nice and comfy.  Definitely serves the purpose well.
483. I have used this product for 20 years and it's awesome.  It's great for the "just got out of bed" look and the sexy "I didn't do anything to my hair to get it to look this cool" look.  And as I aged and my hair got thinner, the Tancho stick gave me the appearance of fuller, thicker hair.  It's one of the strongest hair waxes I've ever found.  The only thing I would change about this product is to have it without the lavender scent.  People have come to associate this smell with me and I no longer smell it.  However, if I had the choice I would rather not smell like anything.
484. Works well but I don't get why they are using glass which breaks easily and is dangerous especially when u consider that most of us will stand on it barefootedweigh ourselves naked etc. Surely luciteacrylic would make more sense..
485. I saw and bought this product at Vitamin Shoppe because it had 5 ATP, Royal Jelly and several other really good ingredients. I've taken Nootropics by a very reputable company, but they changed their formula and it's not as good as it was before.I took one pill before lunch to see what type off effect it would have on me. It didn't seem to have any kind of effect on me so I felt confident in taking the 2 tablets as prescribed before breakfast with 8oz of water. I didn't notice any improvement on my focus, but I didn't get my 4pm slump. Instead I got a SEVERE, debilitating headache. I made sure I was hydrating really well. By 6 and 7pm my muscles in my entire body began to ache especially around my mid back and I got ringing in my ears. I'be Ringing in the ears usually means something with the kidneys.  I went to bed and continued to drink lots of water and tried to get some sea salt in me to keep my electrolytes in balance.The following day after 13 hours of sleep (I usually get 5) I woke up without the headache and almost all of the pain in the back had subsided except between my shoulder blades. I felt very light headed so I made sure to continue to hydrate and eat well. Had I felt the way I did I took the two tablets I would have gone to the hospital. I don't go to the hospitals. I was that sick from this.There's a LOT of ingredients in this supplement. Proceed with caution. The risks definitely outweighed any possible benefit. I'm a SUPER healthy person so I can't imagine what might happen to someone who is not in as great of shape as I am.
486. would not buy again. very small and too hard to use
487. Adjustable tension is lovely! very sharp and easy to control.case included doesn't quite fit scissors.
488. I purchased this product because I live off of a busy street and need something to drown out the noise while I am trying to sleep.The Dohm does the job however I can still hear a car every once and a while, but it isn't too bad.  You can easily adjust the volume a fair amount by just turning the housing.  (one note about the noise though, despite the claim of white noise being unnoticeable I do find myself having to turn it off if i want quiet)The biggest downside I have found is the machine is always warm to the touch when it is running.  Just a random side note.
489. Greater magnification, but shorter depth of field. Wouldn't work for my computer use so I returned them.
490. I can't complain about the product or the amount of time it took to get the items.  The only thing that was a little concerning was how easily the protective seal came off the top of the bottle when I opened it.  It was sealed, but I suspect it was the glue used at the time of manufacturing.  Other than that, the item was as described and delivered promptly.  The price was also reasonable.  I would buy from this seller again.
491. Cost effective. Can't tell if they are better or the same.
492. Thing has worked good for me. Don't need to use one just wanted to test it. It works for me.
493. I did not attend my expectations.  It did not make my feet smooth at all.  The motor sounds very cheap.  I'm in the process of returning this product.
494. Have a 35 lb dog that loves chewing.  He struggled with the large chewing part and so settled on the foot pads and chewed them off, leaving the rest.  Seemed a bit difficult for him to get a good chomp on.  Otherwise, he was very interested in trying to tear the thing apart.
495. I purchased this as a gift for someone who uses other Fitbit products and he loved it!  It works well and was easy to setup.Edit - A Year LaterAfter using this scale daily for the past year, I'd still give it five stars.  Overall, it's a great product - easy to setup and very easy to use.  It tracks my weight and body fat without me having to do anything.  If you and whomever else is using the scale has different body weights, it will automatically save your information to your profile without needing to ask who is utilizing the scale - pretty cool.  If weights are closesimilar, it will show its best guess on the screen and if it's wrong, you just tap the scale with your foot and it switches to the other person.I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  It makes a great gift for anyone but be sure to buy yourself one first!
496. Ever since a young age, I've been diagnosed with Erectile Disfunction (ED). I will often lay in my bed for hours, stroking my penis, begging my body for an erection. My wife, who married me when my penis was stronger than a mule horse, would quietly remain unsatisfied for weeks, months, and at times, years. One day, as I browsed Amazon, I found the cure to my problems. After adding this pound of muscle to my penis, I can more than satisfy my wife; I can literally impale her.I remember days when I would sit in a tree in my backyard and peer into the bedroom of my neighbor, a black man with a very respectable penis, who would plough his wife until she screamed the names of religions that did not exist yet. Now, it is he who stares at my crotch, lost in awe at what lies within.
497. Soooooo Comfey and what we needed for stadium seating on wood seats. We ordered four and four happy people.
498. Doesn't seem to work as good as my old one (doesn't get hot enough), but it's ok until I find a better one.
499. Great taste
500. Seriously, be careful this gets very hot you could burn yourself, you don't have to have it all the way up to 410 to produce curls, just be careful!!...all in all it is a great curling iron brush!! It not only makes curls but gives your hair a lot of body!! I love it!!
501. After riding my bike, I will drink an entire bottle to replenish electrolytes. It tastes good, especially when chilled. I highly recommend this product
502. This glasses strap stays on the glasses even with thin ear pieces.  I would order it again.
503. All empty capsules are not equal.  These are far superior to other ones that I've had as these close perfectly every time coming out of a 100 capsule filling machine.  I've yet to have one fall apart and dump powder everywhere as I have had with other capsules.
504. I've been a reishi mushroom powder user now for over a year, though this is my first time with this particular name brand.  Reishi is known for its anti-cancer fighting ability, helps reduce body inflammation and pain, allows for less sticky red blood cells and plaque and helps to cut down the risk for atherosclerosis.  In short, it is a bit of a wonder drug and I've seen people go on it and have serious positive changes in their health within a matter of months.  Most of those changes have been related directly to inflammation or cardiac issues.So the question then becomes, is this good brand of Reishi?  To that I'd say yes.  Reishi can sometimes seem a bit musty and old [as if mushrooms would taste any different, right?]  But this in fact is a good product.  There is no mustiness and the powder is sweet [in an earthy way, not a sugary way], and it just smells and tastes fresh.  The packaging is solid and thick, thus limiting the exposure to air after packaging.Now for dosages, because this is the other thing that everyone wants to know but so many people forget.  Personally, I aim for a level tsp per day, either mixed in with a green smoothie or my coffee.  When using it in the coffee, I'll also add some coconut oil or MCT oil for a super charge that keeps me mellow during the day.  My wife on the other hand, keeps her dosage to about a half tsp per day and has about the same effects.This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their health.
505. This is great Maca!  Super digestion as it is gelatinized and I noticed significant improvements in hormonal values and energy within a couple of days.  I've also added this to my wife's smoothie protocol as well and her fibromyalgia has significantly reduced.  Quite accidentally, I ended up leaving the stuff behind when taking a trip and within a couple of days all of the effects started to disappear.  Got right back on it when I got home.On the flip side, I purchased this stuff at $21  just 3 months ago and now its over $31.  Not happy about that.  However, I do note that they give you discounts on shipping if you order more than one, so there's that.
506. Good quality for the price
507. Very soft and comfortable socks
508. Great, exactly what I was looking for
509. Highly recommend!
510. Finally I found a great heating pad. This one has 6 heat settings and normally you would have to use the highest but not on this pad. Also the size is excellent. I have been looking for one like this forever. My neighbor is going to order one now as well. Thank you very much.
511. If your an active person this cover tape is what you may be looking for, tape provides for a secure attachment of your sensor.
512. I got this curling wand on clearance at TJ Maxx and it was a great purchase! I was skeptical of how easy this wand would be to use because I'd only ever used a curling iron with a clamp. If you have never used a curling wand before, watch some YouTube tutorials first. I have shoulder length hair and it took about 15 minutes to curl it all the first time. I like the result of this curling wand better than using a curling iron because the waves are more consistent and there are no clamp lines like there would be with a regular curling iron. My waves lasted all day and I slept on them and even woke up with waves!
513. they arrived as I expected - good quality
514. Doesn’t really clean anything..
515. Must be mixed with something to mask the taste. Organic maple syrup and oat milk and cinnamon mixed with Neem Powder is how I drink it.
516. The rolls are tiny, the paper a bit harsh, but it does the job.
517. It's cute and and &#34;blingy&#34;; it looks somewhat cheap, but when in my hair it still looks good.
518. Very convenient.  Love the bumps on the bottom of the bucket.
519. doesn't work all the time
520. Meh. It's a weird applicator to use for makeup. The way that is is cleanable is great for reducing the spread of bacteria, but the way it applies your makeup is kind of odd and patchy and dry. Not sure if I would purchase it again.
521. I think it's working.  My joints feel better and are not painful.  I am also taking other products for joint support as well.  I know.  I know.  Bad DOE (Design of Experiment).
522. These are wonderful adhesive dots, nice  and thin while strong at the same time.  I love them so much I bought 4 more boxes.
523. Received items in crushed box, all tissue boxes inside crushed. Still usable, too much trouble to return. VERY DISAPPOINTED in packaging.
524. My son loves it! Good taste!!!
525. I have had the same bulky blow dryer given to me by my MIL for years now. It did it’s job for the most part, but it was nothing special.  It was time to replace it, and I wanted something lighter (I injured my shoulder) because my old one was causing major fatigue with how heavy it was and how long it took my hair to dry. This one is significantly lighter, and I never realized what a difference a diffuser makes! I can get the volume I like, without all the products I was having to use before!Be aware, as much as I love this dryer compared to my old one, it is not without it's flaws; the major one being ... If used on the highest setting, it IS hot (almost too hot) and after 3-5 minutes of straight use (on high) it pops the fuse nearly every time. It has a built in surge protector on the plug; and I have it plugged into another surge protector, and one of them always seems to pop with "prolonged" use. It still functions much better than my old one, so it's not a deal breaker for me thankfully.Is it still an
526. I do not know if these work as described. There was an offer for a free bottle with review, which made me not trust any of the reviews and hesitant to try it. I returned.
527. Been using these for all three of my kids for months now. Definitely recommend, great product and super fast shipping.
528. It was great
529. Would to have a lower strength, 1.75-2.00..
530. Good probiotic but too expensive for what it does in my opinion.
531. Great bib for a messy eater!
532. These clippers are sold under various brand names but have one thing in common-they do the job. Regular clippers that are of the same design always used to scare me because for what ever reason they were too imprecise and often ended up cutting into the nail's quick and frankly made me avoid clipping my nails until they were past due. Eventually I gave up using clippers and just used the scissors in my Swiss Army knife which lead to imprecise cuts that needed filing to look acceptable but at least they didn't draw blood.  Thick solid build that made me realize just how cheaply regular clippers were stamped out. The cutting edges are precisely machined and in the 8 years I have owned them there is no perceived dulling of the cutting edges.  The product should last a life time  A lot of time I have just held them and admired how precisely they were built and how attractive the results were. I own both sizes(toenaillarge and fingernailsmall) and find the small size hard to to get a firm grip on,I would recommend caution about  the small size regardless of your finger size and opt for the large regardless for both toe and fingernails. The only thing approaching second rate is the brand name decal stuck in the indentation, the clippers themselves should have Green Bell stamped on back. They sold as Seki Edge but are the same Green Bell clippers.
533. This is the easiest to swallow CoQ that I have.  I even prefer it to the gummies which are gag awful.
534. Work fine.  Comfortable and a good size.  My only problem is getting them symmetrically placed.
535. Been using it for  years as part of my supplements regimen.  Never felt better!
536. No vitamins what so ever!  Must of read somewhere that it was the best bang for your buck though!
537. I'm incredibly disappointed in this product. After 2 weeks of using this diffuser its already brokendoesn't work. I'll add the water and essential oil and after 2 minutes of being on it turns itself off. I've tried plugging it into different outlets and selecting different settings and it still does not work.
538. I love the color! There is NO smell which surprises me because most of the other natural nail polishes I have tried do have smell. The only thing I don't like is how fast it Chips. It doesn't really stick to the nail. Maybe if I get a great base coat it will stay better.
539. I hung them up at my friends surprise party as decorations and they were super cute! Very decently priced so I was very happy with my purchase!
540. I got this for my father who is advanced in age. His feet ache continuously. Blue Emu is the first foot salve that gave him relief. He loves this stuff.
541. My mom love it been using for 30yrs
542. Cheeper than the MLM , .I use now an then .Whan I was taking every day , my hair got very dark .
543. The order came on time undamaged and I am pleased I ordered this product.I never thought being to acidic would cause many health issues,now I can keep myself in check daily,or whenever I want.I plan to order from this company for giving this product as x-mas gifts to people in my circle.
544. Have used it every morning, not sure that I have noticed a difference in myself from taking it.  The taste is bitter but not bad. I may switch to a powder form that is incorporated into a product that contains other similar super foods.
545. Very good product that helps reduce symptoms when it's impossible to avoid all high histamine foods every day. I appreciate being able to get two bottles at a time bc sometimes I need more than 1 bottle a month. Sometimes you need two caps a day, not just one.
546. It works....it's expensive ...but I'd buy again.
547. Excellent Product - I feel the benefits.
548. I liked the unit but after very little use one of the wheels got all wobbly because the bearings fell apart. I returned the unit for a refund.
549. Skin is smoother and contains more moisture. Luster of the skin has increased and see a surge in energy
550. Did nothing for me, Made me hungry after taking it.
551. Extremely hard material that hurt my skin. Sent it back!
552. Get ready to progressgag. This stuff is rancid but effective af. Kid you not though, it's inedible. I put a shot of water in it and just throw it back and chase it with a spoonful of peanut butter. The price of beauty....
553. Its one thing for it to taste bad, but it offers no health advantage either. Ive been using green supplements for 20 years and they usually make you feel great. Not the case with this.
554. Too bulky to be woren as a necklace. I thought the stones were going to be small and suitable to be worn on the neck, they are too heavy on the neck. Btw, I am 6ft tall and muscular.
555. Hardly use it.  Not that great of a product.
556. Great Bottles!
557. It works for me. I only take it when my stomach is upset. It smells like cinnamon.
558. Work great. Very useful.
559. I am very happy with the small size of these capsules. The extra fruit and veggies added into my day to day is fantastic. I was nervous they would be too big especially since these capsules always float and mess with my headability to swallow pills but they really are great.
560. We finally got it to work after charging twice but it was a major let down.
561. Everyone loves it! I got it for my son's wheelchair, everyone sees it and want to try it. They all love it.Grateful, to get this one. Insurance is taking forever to get a new cushion. This is very nice and affordable.
562. They run small. Son is thin and wears a size 9.5 shoe. These are tight on him. If you are a bigger person they may be uncomfortabletight.
563. Returned for a shorter half roll. This was not the right roller.
564. I am very happy with this product. I hate taking bulky vitamins and trying to remember how many to take. This is a convienent and easy fit in my fast paced lifestyle. It has no flavor and is a very fine powder. This makes it easy to add to shakes, yogurt, or oatmeal. The only thing I didn't like was the resealable bag it came in, because it doesn't close well. I just ended up putting the product in another container.  This has been the best way for me to add these essential nutrients to my diet. Thank you!
565. Great for child's Birthday
566. This product actually works.. I don't have back issues, I am 130lbs and I do commercial construction. I use to come home, most of the nights with an achy back, working plus wearing a tool belt, with this product I haven't had an achy back besides when I don't wear this product and it's also half way decent. It's a bit bulky but to save the lower back it's worth the sweat
567. Love the phiten single braid necklace. Suites me much better than the tornadoes. Infeelma difference in my healing and sleeping
568. Came leaky
569. Good value for your money! I have reactions to some contact solution but this works well for me. I use optifree as well.
570. Obviously you get what you pay for. Came in a timely manner but I put the batteries in the tool and switched it off. It did not go off it just kept spinning. I had to take the batteries out of it to stop it. I only used it once and it never worked for me again
571. So far it is the best quality on the market for such affordable price! I have combination, acne-prone skin and this has been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine! I use it twice a day, once in the evening when I shower. Also make sure you use the sponge everyday and keep it kind of wet so it will not dry and will last much longer! I simply love it! It has really made a difference in helping clear up my skin and keep it clear. I love that it exfoliates without being harsh, and I love that the sponge itself lasts for so long! I've had mine for almost 2 weeks now, and I will probably replace in a month or so. I highly recommend giving this a try, it has really helped me!
572. Good product, love that it's clean, but does not dissolve as well as other brands of peptides I have tried. Their BCAA's are awesome though!
573. the packaging was different than what is pictured but I really like the fragrance and the way it lathers - I would love to see it packaged in a glass jar - more for the aesthetic look
574. Not as good as some of the others.
575. Perfect for variety of holiday gifts.
576. I use this Soylent powder daily in my morning shakes. The packets were handy when I needed to travek.
577. Exactly as expected! Each letter comes with two small hole punches for extra sturdiness and the string to wind through to create the banner. All letters were present and the quality of the glitter card stock was good. Excellent value for the price. Shipped in packaging that kept the letters from bending.
578. These bars are amazing - low sugar - high protein - probiotics! Make you so full - sometimes I can't get through whole bar. Kids love this flavor too. Like this one better than almond one. Hard to find in stores - wish they sold them more places. Please carry through Whole Foods!
579. I grabbed a pack of water bottles and a gallon of this stuff. I diluted it to 1:1 or 50% in the bottle.Half water half degreaser solution.I got this specifically for degreasing old old old Schwinn Stingray parts.I was gifted a 1965 StingRay my mom found at a garage sale back in 1992.A neighbor spraypainted it all black with magenta wheels and all that junk..Fast forward to 2020 and I'm stripping it down and rebuilding it for my 8 year old niece.Black with flames :).Anyway all the bearings in it needed heavy heavy degreasing. 60 year old bike grease is some of the stickiest nastiest stuff you'll ever encounter. I put the bearing and many other of the quality parts into 100% degreaser after spraying them down with some initial clean up with the diluted solution..The  solution melts grease. IT IS INCREDIBLE..I didn't stop there. I use it everywhere now..On motorcycle parts, car engine bay, and on Grill utensils.You know that Steel brush you use to scrape the grill off after usage?That thing is fulll of grease of course!Soak it in this for a few minutes and rinse it out and it's brand new..Anywhere you can imagine grease existing, this will degrease it..It's phenomenal stuff.A gallon will last me a while but I will DEFINITELY always have this on hand for any dirty greasy job.Cheers
580. I really love the new trend of healthier snacking. I've always been someone who loves food and indulging, but hate the post gluttony regret. With Companies like Jim Buddies coming into play, I can feel a little better about my sweet tooth.This was my first order and I went with the variety pack. Have to say I really enjoyed these. The donuts are the right stackable size and help curve my sweet tooth. The marcos are on point and are easily worked into my daily calorie intake and you got to love the protein boost (11g). The donut itself is cake like and moist, I was really pleased with the texture. Typically high protein products can be super dense and these were very well done.If I could make one change I would love to have a glaze, frosting or even like a textural component. I would love to see these with a boost of sweetness as a glaze, powder or frosting. I'm sure this is something these guys are looking into.I would 100% recommend trying these if you're looking for a healthy donut alternative. Pro-tip microwave for 10 second or toast in the toaster oven for 30 second to warm them up.
581. Update - 01062021Had to get my hands on the new flavors! tried the sample pack and loved them. Great tasting with the same BUZZ!Original Review:I'm no stranger to caffeine as someone who has always taken pre-workouts and drank energy drinks. I have a pretty high tolerance to the stuff. I'm always on the lookout to try new products and came across this sample pack of NEU's three flavors and figured I'd give it a whirl.The three shots arrived quickly to my door and I waited for the right moment to try the first one. All the flavors were good, but I personally liked the original tropical punch the best (green). I took the first shot before a night out and it worked great! The stuff is smooth and I felt a lift in my mood about 15 mins after taking it. It's nice because the 2oz shot doesn't leave you full of liquid, just crazy good energy. I felt great all night and had zero crash which was exactly what I was looking for.I find that the 300mg of caffeine is the sweet spot for me. It's enough to get me going and not too much where I feel too jittery. This product hits that sweet spot perfectly. It also has other ingredients like B12 and Choline for an additional brain boost. Overall the formula is strong, the product looks amazing and the flavors are great.I would highly recommend trying these out for your next night out on the town, study session, or in the office as a pick me up.
582. Perfect! These work great!!
583. not a bad taste at all
584. This fabric softener is wonderful for people with sensitive skin and for those with arthritis because of the easy to use bottles.
585. I’ve been using it for 5 years. It works
586. Overall, the toothbrush is the winner in this combo.  The water flosser is not like our other WaterPik, but that would be because our WaterPik is corded allowing for maximum power.  The toothbrush is a little noisy, but it gets the job done.  I really wish these could be recharged with either micro-USB or even USB-C.  This package would be a great stepping stone for someone looking to get into powered dental care before buying the expensive brushes and water flossers that are out on the market.  Water flossers are not for everyone, but this one could be a good starting point to see if you like that method of flossing.
587. I have been using it and has a nice flavor. Very effective
588. I purchased this product about 2-3 weeks ago and have the same effect as Elyce Rose "Elyce Rose". It is horrible. For the past two weeks my face tingles and feels pressurized and feels like it is about to explode and i feel dizzy. This is a horrible product that clearly contains Niacin (B3). It does not even keep me alert or give me energy, that's the worst part. In fact the last few times i've taken the pills, i've fallen asleep within an hour after.  I am in good shape, exercise daily, and eat very balanced and healthy.  But stay away from this product, it seems like it does a lot more harm than good.
589. This stuff does work, And with heat, But The celopane shipping package is no good, mine luckily wasn't lost but wrap with rubberband from post office.
590. I have bought this product before from other seller and is not even close to the one I used to buy.
591. As advertised quick delivery
592. really helpful
593. Great buy HOWEVER note the expiration date on the are nearing much sooner than if you buy direct from dr gundry himself, which is probably why its cheaper to buy on amazon. (says good for use upto 2 years beyond manufacturers expiration)
594. Very inexpensive for what you get. Seems well constructed and high quality for the price, and the ribbon to hang it is quite sturdy.
595. Great product. Used for years.
596. This product is helping me maintain my weight.
597. The lotion does everything it says, protects from bugs and is an excellent sunscreen. Avon did well in producing this product as well as the pump spray and aerosol can.....I will certainly buy this product again if needed in the future.
598. wife didn't like it unfortunately. kind of bulky to carry.
599. Really helps me relax and helps with headaches.
600. My favorite paper towel.  Very absorbent and I love that it feels like cloth.
601. This stuff is great! Way better than any other brand even oxiclean! highly recommend!
602. Smells like a new unit was installed
603. This gel has strong amount of Epsom. It can be applied to any part of the body and massaged into the skin.One complaint is that it Must be rubbed in thoroughlycompletely, otherwise it leaves a white powder residue.
604. Awesome stuff. The pills are made natural and the results come fast.
605. Doesn't deodorize and doesn't smell pleasant.Edit: used tons. Saturated the insoles. Worked. No smell. Hooray.
606. I'll sum this up quickly. If it sounds too good to be true then it usually is! I saw almost no out of the norm gains after introducing these pills into my workout regimen. I recommend sticking to whey protein and a healthy diet, don't waste your money on this junk.
607. Hey sports fans.  Just what I needed, to make my office chair more comfortable.  In fact, as I write this, I'm sitting on it right now.  Very happy with purchase, recommended indeed.  Have a great day.
608. Seriously I’m writing a review about ear plugs? They’re that great. I have very sensitive hearing and even moderate noise sometimes makes my eardrums hurt. I always carry one pair of these around with me, keep one in the car, etc. just in case I need them. They’re very comfortable and don’t get irritating. They cancel enough noise that I can feel at ease enough sleep, but if I wear them loosely I could still have a conversation with someone at dinner. They are fairly discrete and the little cases are great, too. I’ve used these for almost a year now whether it’s sitting in a coffee shop or traveling on a plane. If you are in the market for ear plugs, look no further. Seriously these are awesome and so comfy.
609. I wish it made a sound as well as the light, because now my partner just turns the bottle around to ignore the light.
610. The flavor is great the price is ridiculous.
611. I bring these with me whenever I travel. I recently got back from Namibia and Botswana. Can't even tell you how many times I found myself in a bathroom with no soap or in a location with no soap and sink after handling animals or about to eat a meal.They're so easy to use. Just be sure that you only use one sheet per hand washing. Two is too many and you'll be stuck trying to get all the extra soap off of your hands.
612. These aminos taste so damn good! I've bought these twice now and I don't know if I'm placeboing myself to death but I could swear that I'm recovering much faster since I started taking them. I've always had a few workouts that have left me sore and spent for the next 2 or so days and that has stopped. Just had to take almost 3 weeks off from the gym and I came back with no soreness inspite of an intense workout.The only issue I have is with the packaging. The bag is way too big and the scoop way too short for the amount you get. You have to stick your hand completely in the bag to get anything out. My knuckles always come out covered. A shorter bag or a small plastic container is really needed. Bag also reads about 40 servings. I got closer to 30 by using the included scoop.*EDIT* I asked Rem (one of the company owners) about the packaging and he said they're going to make the switch to smaller tub containers. So no more dusty knuckles. He responded almost immediately. A+++ customer service.
613. So tasty and they help
614. I like the effect Veinz has but after reading label and noticing they use fructose I will not be ordering again. How can any product claiming to be for health and fitness even think about putting something as unhealthy as fructose in it.
615. I bought this kit for the heels I wanted to wear to my college graduation. I was breaking them in for weeks leading up to the ceremony. I thought this kit would help. But it didn't do anything and I was so disappointed. The pads offered no support - my feet still kept slipping forward. The pads even gave me blisters I didn't have prior to using them with the same shoes. I don't recommend this product at all.
616. Cute! Perfect if you want to compare the flavors.
617. I purchased this seat cushion for a friend of mine who does a lot of sitting throughout the day for work. She has gotten much relief so I am very grateful for this product.
618. Perfect balance of soft bristles that are firm enough to work into the beard. Great product. Don't skimp on buying cheap. Made the mistake, and cheap boars hair feels like plastic.
619. So cute in cute mugs with gifts of hot cocoa bombs at Christmas. Loved the little added touch having super cute straws.
620. Fantastic sponge! Durable and great feel to it. The band help keeps your hand in place.
621. I was having a significant pain in the balls of my feet, and these stick pads have been extremely helpful in reducing the pain and pressure in my foot. Would recommend!
622. Very nice and I like!
623. I really like this! Got this for my 7 year old son! He loves the taste!! Great quality! Contains organic vitamins and minerals! Definitely YES!!!
624. Best tasting Protein I’ve ever had. Vanilla ice cream takes the cake literally.  buy this now,  you will not regret it. There is no chalky taste no grittiness.  it is smooth and I bet if I would were to put it in the freezer I could eat it as ice cream
625. I've enjoyed the premade version so reading the powdered version wasn't the same didn't surprise me. But a lot of reviews claim it tastes terrible and was so different they threw it away. Luckily, I trusted the company and tried this product anyway. Contrary to those low-star reviews, I disagree that it doesn't taste similar, and when mixed in a blender you almost can't tell the difference. I use a small portable version.  Just using a shaker cup doesn't blend it as successfully but ok if you just need that satisfying shake to stave off snack cravings. I find this meal replacement to be very satisfying and helps stop me from craving excess food. I do 2 scoops to actually replace a meal, 1 scoop to stave off snacking (note: the container says 12 c is for 8oz & 23 c (2 scoops) is for 12 oz). Not as creamy as the premade but probably not as many additives, either. Unfortunately, I've realized this product causes stomach discomfort so I can't enjoy it as often as I would like. If you pop and enzyme pill and a probiotic pill just before, it helps a lot with the gas.
626. Our go-to balm for most things- baby bum's, scratches, cuts, chapped lips and hands... so many uses!
627. I have severe lower back issues. This provides great support both in my car seat and my chair.
628. This tongue scraper works very very well! I could never really clean my tongue with a toothbrush, it just made me gag but this is really nice. I can take it to the back of my tongue and just scrape the entire top side of my tongue and actually clean it very well!Definitely recommend this product!
629. As a guy, exfoliating the skin is not an easy task and sometimes i get lazy (maybe most of the time to be honest) but after using the Body Bar for the first time - I was hooked! I purchased the The Body Bar - Exfoliating Body Scrub Loofah & Moisturizing Body Wash Soap 2 in 1 by Bathing Beauty. The Body Bar works amazingly well and the after effect with the Shea Butter, Aloe, & Vitamin E nourish and moisturize skin, it gently exfoliate the skin while deep cleansing. Great for everyday skin care and all skin types. I highly recommend this product for guys and girls.
630. I have lymphedema in my legs and this is a cooling, tingly lotion for my skin.  I have to wear heavy compression stockings and a night garment so this makes my legs feel so good.  It keeps my skin nice and soft which anyone that has lymphedema knows is a must to keep it in check.
631. I use this for my hikes and runs and its great.
632. Great product, great seller
633. I purchased my first brush like this about 54 years ago, Replaced that one with another just like it. This is my third brush like this and if I outlive this one I will replace it with another one like it. It has been like a well loved friend . Thanks Amazon and Fuller Brush.
634. If you want to buy the best Carlons has been in the fish oil business ages before the fad began.
635. Way better than expected
636. This is the only detergent that can tackle my gym clothes for the week and doesn't cause skin issues. I have very sensitive skin and have 0 problems with BLZ. I keep it on auto-ship.
637. Good quality multi for 40+ men
638. They were OK but lost them easily since they are so small (Be sure to use the little case)
639. This product works perfectly.  It does exactly what it says it will do.  And it's an amazing price!  I would recommend this to anyone.  I have one for most of my rooms but plan to get two more so that ALL rooms have it!
640. Highly recommended and researched this is the best prenatal we could find at the time
641. These are awesome. Since I dont take baths, I don't get the aromatic benefits of bath bombs but these let me have a bomb without the bath. Each lasted 2 showers for me but I kept it off to the side so it dissolves slower.Love the scents...not too overwhelming but just subtle enough to enjoy it.
642. Great product.
643. These do not fit on the size of heels indicated. They are too narrow, even on my skinny stelettos. I tried several times to get them on before finally giving up.
644. I'm so glad I got these! They last just as long as the original battery, and it's invaluable to have extra batteries when you're places without electricity such as camping trips! If you have the camera, it's worth the few bucks to get the extra batteries. I got an exceptional price!
645. One end is same as a people brush. The other end is smaller but not thinner. I use the small end.  Switched to my finger.
646. Nice quality and very cute.
647. I love this stuff. I put it in hot tea in the evenings. I would and have recommended to friends.
648. The white chocolate cookie is my favorite flavor so far. It taste almost like the Hershey's cookies and cream candy. It's not as healthy as my favorite protein bar (raw rev glo creamy peanut butter), but tastier! I'm actually keeping this subscription. I wish it was cheaper. Even with the 15% discount, it's still pretty expensive!
649. So this product definitely works for eliminating the odor in your shoes. HOWEVER, it doesn't prevent your shoes from getting stinky again after a long day. For that I've actually had much better success with a powder product called Gran's Remedy. It works. But while just using the powder, your shoes might have a little bit of a smell by themselves after a time, so if you really just want to kill the smell of your shoes while at home or something, this spray will definitely do that. I think it is pretty nuclear though, so try not to be downwind of it.
650. Good for the baby!
651. Great Samples From Great Companies - LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
652. Great product, customer service was great, thanks!
653. SOLID Preworkout.... Taken many many pre's during my time... hands down one of the BEST.... Must try!
654. How can you pissible eat the recommended 5 servings of fruit and 5 serving of vegatables a day... Answer: You Can't.  So, that's why I take this product every day.  It also helps me to keep my hair (which at my age is difficult).
655. I have one heaping teaspoon a day and it's like eating 3 lbs of carrots.  Could you eat 3 lbs of carrot a day...? I know I can't.A great product!
656. I like it. One tip though - cleaning your face is not to be underestimated. I broke out after using this and it was not the fault of the product. Rather, I brought up a lot of bacteria and spread it all around my face.
657. Taste pretty good.  But again very sweet. Follow directions exactly.  Do not add  more water than stated. It becomes very watery and taste really bad if you do.  I only make half at a time. It's too sweet. Also if you are sensitive to chocolate as I am it will give you a head ace.
658. This box of Breakfast on the go is better. But still very sweet.
659. I recommend this product.
660. It is like a very mild Chloraseptic spray.  I use it, as I do a lot of talking at work.  This helps me maintain my voice.
661. I didn't have high expectations for this product, but I thought it would freshen some pillows and wool suits. Several loads later, I have to admit that this product doesn't seem to do anything at all. It's the equivalent of throwing dry clothes in the dryer with a dryer sheet. Except far more expensive. I do not recommend it and I won't be buying it again.
662. If you want a product that makes your face vibrate and still keeps your teeth dirty, this is the product for you! I tried moving it around in my mouth and it just tore my entire mouth apart. Not to mention it’s hard to even clean this product. I’ve had better luck with a 1 dollar toothbrush from a gas station than this.
663. The smell is strong and amazing. We add it to our shower melts and they work and sell amazing!
664. These are very convenient. The box looks nice enough that I can put them on a side table.
665. I love this product its the real dealeasy to clean ans soaks well
666. Helps the glasses while grocery shopping.
667. Good value for good ingredients.  Happy with these.
668. I'm pregnant and have an indoor cat. Her litter tray is in our small bathroom. I needed something to aid in cleaning bacteria in the air. After 2 days using this device, it appears to be working well in our bathroom over the kitty litter. Within 6+ hours you could tell it has cleaned the stale air (scooping the poop out of the kitty litter as quickly as possible, and flushing it is advisable). I like the devise, but will also continue to clean the bathroom with bleach as well.
669. I don't use this consistently but haven't noticed much results yet.
670. I really like these lens cleaners. The moisture is perfect. They don’t leave my lenses with streaks. I’ve tried other wipes and they left streaks on my lenses because they were too wet.
671. The first issue was that the soap didn't come out of the wand. Easily solved by poking a larger hole in the soap wand using a paring knife. Second issue was that even after creating a larger opening for soap to come out, the sponge was too thickdense for the soap to saturate sufficiently. Again, an easy fix - I simply used my paring knife to make a small slit in the center of the sponge. At this point, despite having to make these minor adjustments, I was still OK with the product because, hey, this scrubber is always in my sink, and I always have a knife that needs cleaning. So despite the fact that a product *should* perform as intended without the need for alterations, the literal 5-second investment was worth it in a world where Scotch-brite refills have apparently gone the way of the dodo. But I digress. The real issue -- and this one is insurmountable -- is that the flipping sponge pops off of the little bracket that attaches it to the wand...every...single...time!! Honestly, I hate stinky sponges that sit in and around sinks so much that I actually thought about purchasing some sort of waterproof glue to reattach the sponges to the brackets...but I mean, c'mon. Anyway, total pass on this one.
672. This thing destroyed a pair of pants. It also pulled places and added more pilling on a sweater.
673. These are a must have to keep on hand. I have narrow heels and often put these in the back of shoes. They have little silicone fingers that actually shape against your foot to hold them.  No blisters!
674. My guest absolutely loved them for opening bottles and pushing buttons without touching them personally
675. My boys love these brushes. They like being able to choose a different color each night.
676. These made my glasses stop slipping down my nose
677. It is a beautiful bracelet and fits my small wrist. Shiney and not tarnished.  Very happy and thank you for having this size. Perfect
678. I don’t know how anyone who gave this a positive review was able to insert them into the ear at all. The material is very flimsy and they collapse at the slightest amount of pressure. After 30 minutes Of fumbling I gave them to the flight attendant to put in the garbage. They’re worthless. Stick with the putty type which always stay in place and block all sound. The only reason I tried them was that they’re in a smaller case than what I currently use. CAVEAT EMPTOR!
679. Great buy!!!! I would recommend seller ant time.Thanks.
680. Taste great, a nice alternative to water. To be honest I am not sure how much it actually helps my progress in the gym, but it does taste good and it helps keep me hydrated.
681. I'd say this is a good deal for occasional use, such as if you're travelling.  The eye mask has begun to fall apart in about six weeks.  It's handy enough, but if you're bedroom is flooded with light first thing (and you plan on wearing it every night, as I do), you may wish to forego the ear plugs and spend $20 on a more durable and more comfortable eye mask.
682. I love many of Life Extension's products, and I take two fairly regularly (I need to be cost conscious).  It's possible that I don't need Nitrovasc, but I noticed nothing over the month or so that I was taking this.
683. I wanted the try this product cause it had Diindolylmethane (DIM); a estrogen blocker which helps with bloating and water retention. I didn’t notice any difference in the gym and I kept my body building diet intact. I did see a little difference in appearance and I drop a percentage of body fat. I used the product for a month and I’m 6 feet , 235. I think you need to use it for a good 60 days to see results.
684. My nutritionist recommended this supplement for me after back surgery. I use it to control my blood pressure, allergies, guy health, and preventing coldsinfections in my body. I take this supplement faithfully for 2 years and I have not been sick. Recently I didnt take the supplement for a week and I discovered a allergy to pollen. I started to take the  allicidin again and allgeries went away. This is a great product.
685. Bang Energy drinks are life. I use to be a Rockstar head but now "all I do is Bang". It's awesome before workouts and a great pick me up during my night shift job. I also love the energy drinks because it has zero carbs which is great for my Keto Lifestyle.  I have tried all of the Bang Flavors and Power Punch is in my top 3.
686. Good product at a good price
687. Does a great job for those hard to reach places.
688. This is by far the best glue out there.  Stays long and is waterproof.  Great for someone like me who is active
689. Great iron for getting your ferritin up!
690. This product has all three ampk boosters {Gynostemma, quercetin, Berberine} I bought Master Switch to help support my natural ampk, fight deep stomach fat and to boost my energy. To soon to report whether there is any improvement in these areas yet.
691. I have read a lot about magnesium deficiency, and it's a real conundrum. People die of heart attacks from it. But most forms of magnesium can't be taken in high enough doses to quickly build magnesium levels without causing diarrhea. I have experimented with taking different amounts of this product and have had no problem with abdominal cramping or diarrhea. this is one of the few breakthroughs in the world of supplements.
692. This stuff is delicious! I don't know why every shake powder has to be Chocolate, Vanilla, or Berry... or those hyper-sweetened flavors, so this one is a great option if you just want a tasty shake that tastes like oatmeal (delicious). I wish the carbs were lower, but I mitigate that by using unsweetened  flax  soy  almond milk, or a green juice (spinach, lemon, apple, carrot) and it makes it very balanced.
693. Very good, and clear sounding speaker. It definitely works better than I thought it would. It has several different sounds that was not expected. Great purchase.
694. I was hesitant to get this based on some of the negative reviews here - but the positive ones convinced me to try it.  And, the price was good enough that I thought &#34;why not?&#34;First of all, I have fibromyalgia and have severe pains and have been desperate.  I'm not someone who is comfortable to get a massage, and even if I was I would be poor if I went as often as I would need to.  So, what to do?Ok.  I got it today and tried it about a half an hour ago.  I think that alone tells you what I think of this spa mat!  (that I literally came on here to review it right away)  :)I didn't even bother with &#34;low&#34; and went right to &#34;medium&#34; (high seemed to scare me for the initial setting - I figured it'd be similar to a tsunami).  The power of the bubbles was AMAZING!  Gets you ALL over and was so powerful that the tub looked like a pot of crazy hot boiling water.  And that was on MEDIUM!Oh, and yeah - while a 10-15 minute bath is usually cool at the end, this amazin' beauty keep the water at a nice temp.  :)Regarding the mat floating - it does.  Some of the suction cups stuck great and others did not.  Frankly, who cares??  This is supposed to make the water bubble and it does that job fantastically.  Made me feel good and relaxed :)  WOO!Lastly - other people complained about the noise.  The noise of the unit is quiet.  The MASSIVE BUBBLING is noisy!  ;)  And seriously, if you're complaining about bubbling noise then why did you get a &#34;body bubbles bath spa&#34; mat?  lol  Personally, I liked it and it reminded me of being on vacation and in a big hot tub.And, for storage, I figured that since I'll likely be using it 2-3 times a week the best way to store the mat is just to stick it on the side of the shower wall ;)  Perfect (so the excess water can drain out and it can dry well).
695. Not as described.  It's not a 1 inch curling iron.  Between 34 and 78 inch. Even though label on box says 1".  Grrrr.  Going to keep it because it is a longer barrel than usual.  But AGGRAVATING
696. Love it, use it for everything
697. A little too stiff
698. I love this dry brush!  I’ve never heard of dry brushing before but I’m glad I did!  The dry brush is very invigorating.  I used it on the backs of my arms and legs and my back in circular motions. (I wish now I had bought the handle, my husband helped me) It felt so good and left my skin with a rosy glow.  After showering I felt the circulation much improved in all the areas I brushed.  First day it just felt good. The second time I used it I noticed my skin tightening a bit and the skin on my arms felt softer, Even my lotion seemed to absorb better.  I’m very satisfied with the construction of the brush also.  It’s well worth what I paid.  The strap is secure and it has a groove in the back to attach a handle, which I’m purchasing right away!
699. Easy way to get your fiber and no mixing!
700. Helped with anxiety, stress, and relaxation. Highly recommended!  Very good quality.
701. Doesn't stay in place and too large.
702. I don't know if it does what it says it doesBut it felt amazing as I was washing my hairDefinitely not too sharp unless you're jamming it into your head
703. Wet charcoal goes everywhere, so beware! And, it takes a lot to get it out of your teeth and gums. Even after brushing with toothpaste I had to floss twice. Have only used once so no results yet, but so far I'm not impressed.
704. I bought this  because my dr reccomended,It works great!
705. Good product, will buy again.
706. This is a simple hinged uncomplicated brace that provides decent lateral stability and some joint support. I use it when walking 18 holes of golf or going for walks around town. If doing more aggressive backcountry hiking use a higher end but more bulky brace. Recommend if you need a modest level of joint support. If you have substantial knee pain andor get knee stiffness after exercise, suggest a higher end brace.
707. Wow! This stuff really works! I received a sample in a beauty box and it worked great, so decided to order larger bottles for our vacation trip. These are a lifesaver. I don't think I can live without it. Spray-on and smooth out the wrinkles . Easy-peasy.
708. Seems like a big help in the shower, no complaints!
709. SSOOOOO uncomfortable!  The thick Velcro straps double back under your armpit and it's like having 2 belts wrapped up under your arms, miserable, I couldn't wear it 10 minutes.
710. There fine
711. Decent boost, great flavor, unusual in most preworkouts, will buy again
712. I took a chance on this coffee. I was well rewarded. This coffee has a ton of caffeine in it. If you have a heart condition this coffee may not be for you!
713. Very fine powder, no taste, blends well in smoothies.  This will last a long time since the serving size is small.
714. Have no issues with them holding
715. Don't bother with this
716. This clears my stuffy nose, love it!
717. I have arthritis on my thumbs. I purchase 2 peices. It's exactly what I was looking for. Works amazing.
718. I buy of this terrible ever light, work one month, and don't work any more,bad product.
719. My 4 grandchildren - ages 5,4 and 2 were always taking my gloves - so I bought them their own.  They wear them the whole time they are here.  I let them help me wash dishes - quite the mess but we have fun!
720. This has really helped my success with THM so far. Knowing that I can make a dessert that's safe and yummy saves my sanity.
721. Ok, so I have to say that my intended use is not what these are marketed for, but the are still exactly what I needed. I have some smaller fish tanks in my home and have had great difficulty in finding good cleaners for the sides of the tanks that are small enough and will not scratch. These work wonderfully for the purpose. The sticks are plastic, not paper, so they do not disintegrate and are reusable if cleaned appropriately. Very pleased.
722. These definitely take some getting used to but feel great once you do. It almost seems like it massages your feet as you walk. These are basically little air pillows that move around back and forth as you walk. Think of it as those packaging air pillows that you get when you order something online, except these have less air in them and are for your feet. Very hard to explain but it was very weird to use them in the beginning. After about a week or so I started to get used to them and kind of like it. I use it in my every day shoes now. As far as how effective they are, I really have no idea. All I know is that I like them. Can I live without them? Sure but since I have them I'll continue to use them until they break, which might take a while.
723. Works great for touch up and when camping.
724. Doesn't do for my big size cat...Brush is very not flexible, hard...my cat doesn't like it at all...
725. Taste nothing like salted caramel it is nasty tasting and I have tasted way better flavors of whey then this. I am a caramel fanatic when I am looking for a good whey that doesn't have hidden sugars and was disappointed that I spent 50 flats on something I expected a way better taste. I have to down this drink pretty fast because it's not anything I can discribe. Just not caramel of any means. Don't waste your money Extend has a better flavor then this brand of carmel and you get way more for your money.
726. Love this product, helps with diet, and energy level
727. These work very, very good on my back for my fibromyalgia. It’s hard to find this kind that has the heat instead of the lidocaine.
728. Great cases
729. Doesn't work as well as all the other reviewers stated.  It took a long time to heat up to 450 and it doesn't really make my hair as smooth. Perhaps I should have bought a more expensive brand.
730. Great Product!!!
731. It says NO FISH BURPS, but I've been burping fish starting 30 minutes after I took it.  I won't buy these again, because their claims are just not true.
732. Pros: great size, good temp control (7 levels), very softCon: only one; you can feel the heat wires when you hold it. If you’re laying on it, you can’t tell.
733. I am a size 12 and it barely fit
734. These little wipes are amazing!  Y whole family uses them for everything from glasses to camera lenses. The are completely streak free.
735. I love this brand. They are able to source products that are tested And backed by clinical studies so I know what I’m getting. This product gave me the feeling of being alert and Focused without the jitters and I felt like o had control of my thoughts. Took about an hour for me to even realize because it’s just that subtle and smooth.
736. These are great!  I bought the unflavored balms, and they have a perfectly natural, neutral smell to them and zero taste.  They keep my lips from getting chapped and go on smoothly.  I would buy these again.
737. Does the job well. Can feel a difference when I work out and don't take it.
738. I honestly thought this was the worst thing I have ever tasted. It did not taste like vanilla or chai. It honestly tasted like dirt. I have not tried the other flavors. It is a bit too expensive. Even for a sample pack.
739. This is a good product but the packaging makes scooping out the bottom third annoying - I kept my own scoop in the bag as the one that came with the product is too small. Also, calling this a wheatgrass shot is deceptive as a WG shot is pure juice squeezed from the wheatgrass - not dehydrated grass mixed in water
740. Nice white mask but too big
741. I bought this directly from the manufacturer. I must say, for the price, it was not at all worth it. Yes, it is a cushion, but it is a $60 cushion? &#34;Best in the world&#34; ? No. My cushion moves around on my chair all day long, and I usually find myself doing the &#34;one cheek lean&#34;. My computer chair is already cushioned so I went with this cheaper, thinner version (if I had paid $100+ for this, boy would I be disappointed). By the end of the day, there really is no difference, I feel like I've turned or re positioned as many times as I normally would. At first I felt like I would need to get used to the new cushion but after 3-4 weeks or so, it is still uncomfortable. The company reached out to me for my review, I gave the same review I did here, but have not heard back. Return policy is... Meh... Funny because I live in Utah and they are manufactured here in Utah.
742. For me have been an excellent product, increasing my mass and power
743. Sizing WAY off.  This is ASIAN sizing, not US sizing!  An Asian #14 is about equivalent to a US #6
744. Tastes like battery acid and dried puke.  Just pay the extra money and get the capsules.I'm no ninny when it comes to choking down gross powders, but Glucosamine Sulfate tastes like Satan himself pissed in a pool of battery acid and drain cleaner, then dried it out and sold it as a joint supplement.
745. If you're basic, this has pumpkin pie flavored chapstick. It's wonderful!
746. It took off discoloration PLUS removed material that wasn't removed by pixie cup wash or other wipes plus boiling. I did deduct a star because alcohol to wipe a cup that goes in a sensitive area is not the best.
747. Liquid car wax ended up on the carpet of my brand new car. This took it out on the first try after it been there for about 6 months
748. I guess, I mean I didn't get sick on my trip abroad - 12h plane rides included
749. I use hand sanitizer probably 300 times a day as a nurse. My hands used to stay so dry to the point they would crack. Let me just say, alcohol on skin that's not intact hurts like hell. I had to use liquid bandage to cover the cracks in my hands so I wouldn't scream every time I used hand sanitizer. I've tried so many different hand lotions. This is one of my favorites. I keep it on hand at all times - bedside, car, work, I even have a liter in my living room. It's not greasy, absorbs quickly and heals your abused skin pretty rapidly. If used religiously, your hands won't ever be dry or crack. Medline has an entire line dedicated to skin - I actually found this product while working as a wound nurse. Highly recommend!!!!
750. Best product for stage II pressure ulcers and moisture related skin breakdown (incontinence related dermatitis). Wouldnt use as a barrier on intact skin (A&D or zn based product better if skin intact). As a wound certified nurse, this is one of my favorite treatments.......because it works. This particular product is the medline version of lantiseptic
751. This lotion is a must have in my house. I have insane foot and calve cramps that wake me up out of deep sleep. I rub some of this on and within a minute they calm down and I can fall back to sleep. Sometimes I just out it in my feet before bed because it relaxes me and helps me get a good night’s sleep. There is no smell. It’s not overly greasy or sticky. I love this stuff and have recommended it to multiple people who now also swear by it. It’s something I don’t mind spending money on because it’s a necessity.
752. So far I like this product, it’s a little thick but no real taste. Easy to take, just add to water.
753. Absolutely worth it definitely has helped my gains and helped in the bed room a bit too if you know what I mean definitely give it a try!!!
754. Arrived as described. Fast delivery and Item does what its supposed to to balance hormones
755. This is so good.  Love adding this to our smoothies when we are doing a cleanse.
756. It's really small and hard to apply. I have calluses from crossfit plus my hands rip now and then. This is no different than rubbing coconut oil on your hands.
757. Exactly what I needed.
758. Wonderful product!
759. Easy to take great energy without tingles &jitters you easily pump for 90 mins and not know it.
760. Love these
761. Their mixture has improved, as I find it dissolves better after each purchase. I would say purple is my favorite flavor.
762. Super effective and great tasting.
763. Really tasty and high quality product.  Highly recommend.
764. Love this product.  I noticed a huge difference in my skin after using it for a while.
765. Good for getting accurate circumference measures on yourself and others. The plastic portion on the end of the tape keeps the tape from retracting into the container and being lost forever. This portion of the tape needs to be reinforced as the tape is useless once it breaks.
766. Great product.  I was always so cold and the space heater made the air dry but it was never warm enough to work without a coat and gloves on.  With the heater on, my chair is comfortable, my body is warm and the air is no longer super dry.  With the legs and back being heated my arms are no longer frozen and I finally have feeling in my fingers.As a bonus, the heated pad is great for any soreness in legs and lower back, which has made my sleep significantly better.  Highly recommend this item.
767. I'd much prefer a smaller tablet - or even two for the same dose. They are hard and large, making them difficult to swallow.
768. The product description says firm foam. This is a joke there is no firmness at all a one-year-old could squeeze it into a tiny little ball. Total waste of money
769. Worked ok for 3 months and stopped working. I try to contact the seller. Will update soon.UPDATE. 4TH NOVEMBER. SELLER STILL NOT RESPONDING!!!!!
770. I am in search of a stevia sweetened gum to avoid sugar and artificial sweetners, so why are they putting maltitol in this?????? Sort of defeats the whole purpose.
771. Been taking this stuff daily for a couple of months and have noticed a sizable difference in the reduction of lower legcalf cramps. From what I've found, this is the only supplement where you can get 1000mg of potassium in one scoop. Otherwise it is sold in 50mg pills, which would take forever to get to the minimum recommended 3,500mg a day (and you need MORE if you are nursing).I put this in with about 14 cup warmed water (30 sec in microwave) - it seems to dissolve better in warm water. And then I mix it in with 20 oz of flavored water. It does alter the flavor a bit, but you get used to it.
772. Love this! Makes it so much easier to use the mist machine for the 10-15 minutes required
773. I don't use this other than pre-sparring ritual, where my teammates and I would cover our gloves and faces to minimize the cuts from the contact. It helps tremendously for MMAStriking (or both combined) throughout the session. It doesn't get any discomfort and would recommend for boxers or MMA fighters to buy one to prevent any cuts during sparring rounds!
774. Kids wouldn't eat these.  I tried them and I won't eat them either.
775. a total fail, threw most of the bottle away.  Simply going for acupuncture was enough, no need to buy every herb they recommend.
776. Pros: This set contains just about every size cleaning brush you could possibly need to clean your combs, razors and trimmers. They're incredibly easy to clean, too. Cons: I cannot think of anything negative to say about this kit. Love it!
777. The Pros: 1) It has 15 different strains of good bacteria. This is the most outstanding feature of this probiotic blend. It is the case of more is better. Diversity of the gut flora means the healthier the digestive tract. 2) It is delayed release.  This ensures that the good bacterium gets into your lower intestines rather than being destroyed by your stomach acids. 3) Per serving, it has 30 Billion CFU of probiotic organisms. Again, more is better. 4) I have experienced no adverse reactions to the product. 5) My overall digestion has improved resulting in good bowel movements and no constipation. The Con: 1) It contains milk so if you have a diary allergy or intolerance, you should not take this product.In conclusion, Premiva Ultra Probiotic is a good solid product that would likely improve your digestion as well as boost your immunity. Disclaimer - I was fortunate to receive this complementary probiotic in return for my fair and honest evaluation. I am under no obligation to give a favorable review. I write these reviews in the hope that they will help other consumers like me to make the best purchasing decisions for their money. As an avid researcher, I have save myself time, money and aggravation by reading other customer reviews and I am grateful to have their input available to me.
778. This is definitely a must buy item. If your skin is acting weird, this product is the solution.
779. Was hoping this would help with the pain in the ball of my foot, but it ended up hurting me more from the elastic around the pad. The pain from this overrode the pain in my foot and caused more pain for me. Very uncomfortable and will need to find something else. What a waste of money!
780. It's great when it works but I have tried to charge it up the last two days and it will not take a charge.  Very disappointed.
781. These are good size making them easy to operate. Being translucent, it allows to keep pill alignment. Much more substantial than expected.
782. The gauze is high quality fluff. It is comparable to the product used in the hospital. Works well for protecting a sensitive incision site. The tape is useless. As a paper tape, it is expected that it have a lower stickiness. This has virtually none. Most comparable to really cheap imitation washi tape. The tape did not stay on longer than 20 minutes. The part which did adhere, tore the skin when removed. Threw the tape away; but continue to use the fluff. Intend to order another package for the fluff but will dispose of the tape.
783. Has a point not normally found on carbide files
784. Hard to get item these days and I don't waste it on my dishwasher.One of those things &#34;not sold in Costco anymore&#34;When I open a box I immediately pour it into a salvaged Heinz Ketchup bottles and dispense it from there.  It is my first line of defense in cleaning the glass jar on my blenders.Just open the recycled bottle flip top and squirt some in on top of hot water and blend away.Rinse and walk away knowing this stuff did a terrific job.
785. My acupuncturist used this oil and I have continued to use it..Great product
786. I bought this to help my back and posture during pregnancy. I work 10-11 hour days at a desk and my back was killing me! I originally was only going to buy the cushion that goes on the back of your chair- but Amazon recommended both pieces. Seeing that I would do just about anything to get some comfort during pregnancy- I splurged and bought both.I am SOOOO glad I did. This corrects your posture and really comforts your behind while sitting. Seeing that I am at my desk for hours everyday- I really need all the support I can get- especially during pregnancy. This works on ANY seat- I've even tried it n my car. You need nothing to install and you'll wonder why you didn't buy one of these earlier. I'm already thinking about my grandparents and parents who would LOVE to have something like this for bad backs.The material is memory foam so it really meshes to fit your needs. I have a pretty small behind but it would fit any size. Since starting to use this I have had a lot less issues with my back and overall more comfortable during the day- I even notice myself sitting up abetter while in other chairs.
787. Love these! They work very well to keep baby happy and regular especially as we are starting to feed baby solids!
788. Tastes great!
789. Did not fit onto any of my 4 eyelash curlers from different brands.
790. Sometimes these things are good sometimes there not. It's always hit or miss when ordering these rollers
791. The instructions were a bit sparse about how to set the range of motion limits, but I was able to figure it out in a minute or two.I ordered a medium (I'm size 9 men's) and it was too big.It's actually quite uncomfortable to walk in as the sole is very thick and my specific injury did not allow for the range of motion that would have made this comfortable.
792. Nice tattoo. It lasted a few days even with showers. Would definitely consider repurchasing.
793. Works perfectly for combining medications for emergency use - just what we needed!
794. Savory chicken tasted awful..and to top it off product couldn’t be returned.  BIG ripoff!
795. Used it daily for a month and saw no results. I would add that this is oil so it makes your face look weird, oily. I wouldn't bother with it.
796. A cup of coffee is much cheaper.
797. Definitely cheap quality. Just expect that. The detachable heads are very cheaply made. The process of taking them on and off looks like it might split them in half. The grinding bit is completely useless just to be clear. It does absolutely nothing. However, the blades don’t hurt upon direct contact (still don’t shave too close or you’ll irritate the skin and cause rashes).Do note that they do not come with any guards. You’ll want to be careful with your dogs whiskers especially in the chin area where the base of the whisker can protrude from the skin. That way, you won’t accidentally hurt your dog.I charged it overnight, and it barely lasted long enough to finish the grooming session. That said, it was my first time, and I don’t know what I’m doing well enough to be fast. So the session was about 2 hours. If you have a large dog or if your dog is heavily matted, you’ll need to do it in multiple sessions in order to charge the device enough for it to last.Overall, it did when it claimed to do, except for the grinder. The longer head was very helpful for the face, feet, and hygienic regions as they are all a bit difficult to reach.
798. From what I can read this is just some coconut water and stevia. Is it really hydrating?
799. Bought for my mini pig, Dewey. Helps his skin and coat stay soft and shiny.
800. Nothing special. A small box of matches with a sorta cute picture of a cat. Definitely not worth almost 7 bucks.
801. Great product. We use it frequently.
802. Fantastic product.  I have never had anything work faster or better.
803. Helps along with other powdered supplements
804. I had wanted this product to get a convenient way to get some sort of "wheat grass shot" into me, on a frequent basis. I was surprised by the bland (almost "watery") taste of it, which leads me to question its nutritional potency.  It seems to me that it should really taste more green, and not all that different from drinking a real wheat grass shot (as created from freshly juiced beneficial grass!)  Also, the amount of foam that gets generated when using a shaker bottle, with a wire whisk, to mix it with water is enormous, adding complications and inconvenience in using it.  I find that an aggravating annoyance.
805. It’s honestly so cute, I love it! I used 7 slots for daily supplements and I use the 8th slot for Tylenol!
806. This chair is everything it said it would be! The price was in my range and it was super easy to put together. You will need help getting it in the house, it is very heavy but comes in 2 pieces. Would definitely recommend. It is a little rough on the hips when you first use it but after using it for a few weeks I don't even notice it . My grandson uses it and he is 6 ft tall and he loves it, very comfortable.
807. This works well except the instructions are very vague. No instructions about how much anti-freeze to add, and leaks around the bottom of the control panel, but works as needed.
808. These are the same ones they sell at my gym for 50 cents a pair.  They are a bit awkward but considering you wear them for 5 minutes and then toss in the trash, they work fine :). Plus, they eliminate any tan lines around the eyes like the around-the-head eye-protectors.
809. Took for a month now still no change it's kinda disappointing you spend money hoping for something but there is no drug that makes miracle happen
810. I use this on my shoulder and upper arm because of pain from a torn rotator cuff.  Works well and stayed on even during a shower.  Was able to remove quickly wo pain... great product..  does what it says it can do..
811. I have C-Spine injury I am treating with decompression therapy in doctor's office.  This device allows me support and decompression like therapy at home and is easy to use. Adjustable tension to fit your needs. A little uncomfortable on the ears takes some getting used to.
812. This is my go-to protein powder after my workouts. Clean ingredients. Delicious taste.
813. Still too big to swallow ! I'd rather take two small pills than gag on one . Why can't anyone come up with a fish pill us humans don't have to risk choking to death to swallow ??
814. Had this set up for Amazon subscription, but was out of stock on the 1st and the 2nd scheduled subscription delivery, so I dropped it.As far as the quality of the product it's excellent. I now just try to order it when it looks like I'll need it.
815. Get ready to hurl!  Thought I'd save a few bucks and try this but ultra is far and away a better product
816. So good, love blending it in my morning coffee with butter and MCT (C8).  Not overly sweet like some others I've tried. Perfect vanilla flavor, not artificial or candy like at all. Better than a Starbucks vanilla latte! I also add and egg yolk.
817. This stuff is quite strong, be sure to spray in a well ventilated area as it gives off a strong orange smell.
818. Since I turned 60 about six years ago, it seems every time my arms come into even small contact with objects, the next day there's a red blob under the skin which is not too bad if you only have one or two spots, but it looks progressively bad if there's a lot of these marks, say after some shrub or rose pruning.  Medical web sites say not to worry, they are fairly common for older people, and, these 'impact blotches' are not an indicator of any serious condition. Fortunately, on a recent trip a relative about my age saw my arms, and said she has the same impact blotches, and suggested this product from Gold Bond would make the red blotches go away, and it indeed does, if you use the lotion, say three times a day for only two or three days. I'm amazed, but it really works !!.
819. I like all of the egg white protein bars from Julians Bakery.  These do have a strong cinnamon flavor if you like cinnamon.  My favorite are the Devils Food Chocolate and the Glazed Donut.  The Sunbutter is an excellent choice too.
820. I was incredibly dissatisfied with this pollen. It's flavor was terrible, it was dry and just seemed old. I've been eating pollen for awhile and decided to try this because the price was so reasonable but this is very low quality, or the way they process it ruins it. I'd rather pay more money and get a higher quality product. As they say, you get what you pay for.
821. Very nice taste. I guess it adds something to health, cannot detect what exactly, but it tastes real nice and reminds me of berries I miss so much, living in the tropics.
822. Great product, great customer service, great idea and does open up nose, sadly doesnt work for everyone. Would recommend to others.
823. Love this product. Great price and quality. It does the job as described on advertisement. It will bring blood pressure down and is great with viruses. I highly recommend. You must take on consistent ongoing basis, so buy the larger size which is a lot for your money.
824. What I wanted and needed
825. This toilet paper is hysterical. My family really likes Trump. One night I invite them all to dinner and put this toilet paper in the bathroom. It was so funny as they went in to use the bathroom everyone came out cracking up!! The toilet paper feels like regular Scott toilet paper. Not soft. I don't really recommend using this for anything other than laughs.The paper itself is in color and features pictures of trump with the words disgusting in a bubble.This is really the perfect gag gift for anyone whether they like trump or not!This would be funny placed anywhere including your own bathroom or the bathroom at work, or anywhere someone will have a sense of humor!I received this toilet paper at a promotional price in order to evaluate it and share my honest and unbiased opinion.
826. I sit at my computer most of the day typing and as a result, I end up sitting hunched over a lot of my day. I really needed something like this massager to kneed the knots in my neck and shoulders.There are straps that you can put your arms in the more weight you put on your arms the more pressure the massage gives. There is the option to have the heat on or off and an option to change the direction of the massage. This also comes with a car charger to be able to use in the car!!I gave this a 4 star because insist comfortably on your neck, but to use lower on your back is not so easy to use, but doable!I received this at a promotional price in order to share my honest experience and opinion.
827. Extra fluffy when new and dry, but not so much once wet. Not as good as the original mop heads but still good for the money.
828. Cuticle trimmer is not sharp or  precise!
829. As long as I have to use a cane, it might as well be pretty.  And this cane is pretty, as well as AFFORDABLE!  I love it!
830. While I liked the ear holder thing the strap was way to small. It seems like these straps you get are either way too big or too small
831. The tea is tasty and does seem to settle irritable tummies.  I tried the loose tea since it seemed to be more economical.  Bad decision.  After trying 3 different tea strainers, all unsuccessfully.  The tea leaves drift through the strainer and the cup had too many loose tea leaves to bear.  I shall stick to the tea bags.  Too much work, too little time to necessitate double straining tea. Thus, the reason for four stars.
832. These were okay. A bit smaller than I thought, but still fit well.  I deducted a star because the frame cracked and the lens fell out of one pair.  It was unusual since they had not dropped or been jarred.Update Aug 1, 2015Not happy that the arms broke on most 46. These would be nice if extra screws were included.
833. I love this. I have one in each bedroom for my kids, and i bought one as a gift for my brother as he is a  poor sleeper. It has the perfect background sound. Not too loud but just right to distract you  even if not sleeping. I would recommend!!
834. A must for every first aid kit
835. This works well, just small, so it requires more uses to get a head of hair curled. I wouldn't recommend for long hair
836. I’ve always read lots of great reviews about the stuff and thought I would try. The stuff was horrible. Are used it to wash my Gallardo and it left shiny little greasy chemical marks all over the car. It wasn’t possible to remove. I ended up using my go to Stoners quick bead detail and that did the trick. That stuff is awesome and can use on every part of your car. Does not leave streaks and better tan actual window cleaner on the windows..
837. This worked really well for my winter boots. I wanted to clean them up before I tucked them away for the winter. I followed the instructions and let the inside of the shoes dry after application and they look and smell great. I ended up cleaning more shoes than I planned to clean because it worked so well. Definitely worth trying!
838. I got this for my son who is having some issues with prostate enlargement.  (PSA test normal).  He says it is helping,, reduced night time bathroom calls and dripping (to some degree).  At this point only taking 1 capsule a day and may increase to 2 to see if reduction in issues increases.  Has to be cautious due to other medications he is taking for other issues.
839. Excellent product. Just what I needed. Petroleum Jelly.
840. My box says "showen steamers." So that sort of negates these being gift quality IMO. There are 3 mentholeucalyptus and 3 lavender. They are individually wrapped and the set includes a tiny plastic device to cut through the wrappers and a tiny purple bag to place the steamer inside while in the shower. The bag is more the sort you use for gifting jewelry. I recently tried some other steamers and the mesh bag was far more appropriate for the product.The steamers themselves are nice. The colours themselves give the impression of gentleness. I could smell them through the box. I placed a steamer in my (other) mesh bag and placed the steamer at the edge of the shower water. There was a pleasant release of steamer scents during the shower. Easy to clean up. At the current listed price, these are on the pricey side.
841. For 6 bath bombs these are on the pricey side, but they are such fun. These were an instant hit and after opening, it was impossible to pick which one to use first.The box wasn't that fancy and really didn't promise much inside. The box is pretty enough colour wise but it's not fancily wrapped.These bombs look good enough to eat which probably explains the caution inside that they are NOT to eat. There are six different shapes colours and scents. Each bomb is individually wrapped too. There's a cupcake with sprinkles, what appears to be a glazed doughnut, a blue heart with gold paint strokes, an orange macaroon with a white centre,  a multi coloured star and a round one with glitter and a rainbow on top.Performance wise, the fizz was long-lasting compared to other bombs I have used. Anyway, lots of fun. Kids may want to use these all at once, so hang onto them.
842. These very large cloud shaped bath bombs are a lot of fun. Shape wise they remind me of the cloud character from Trolls--as noted by a 6 year-year old. These bombs are marketed for kids. You get 3 bombs in the box. That means each bomb is quite pricey. IMO I would prefer more bombs, smaller if necessary.They have a lot of colour and fizz and lasted a long time in the tub. The only downside is the $$ as you won't be using these one a night every night. Cost is too high.
843. The bath bombs all look and smell the same. They are fairly large--about the size of medium oranges. Not gift quality IMO as the box doesn't scream luxury--rather it says utility. Plus it has a wide plastic wrap around it. There's a bar code label firmly stuck on the box which says 'made in china.' I was unable to remove it without tearing the box. So again, an argument against gifting.The bombs are individually wrapped and are strong smelling. Just all the same which is a great pity. There is a tiny variation in colour due to to the swirls, but that's it.Bath bombs have become fancy these days and so these don't compare well. They fizzed and floated for a while and kids love that, but other than that, nothing special. Overall the smell was too strong.
844. I've been taking these for a few weeks now. The capsules are on the large size but easy to swallow with no odor. They are vegan caps and are very clean--by that I mean that they are not full of preservatives. They are made in the USA too.I see on the manufacturer page that it's stated that the product is tested for quality,  and I would like to see these NSF certified.
845. We all have different feet and different needs. I have extremely high arches. These insoles did not work for me. I cut them to size--they were a bit harder to cut than others probably as they are thicker. There are guides on the bottom of the insoles to help you cut to the size you need. I got the medium. I wear 9 or 9 12 size shoes depending on the brand. The medium were supposed to be for women 7-11 and they were only a tiny bit too big for me (hence the cut) so there is no way these would do for someone who wears women's size 11.So trimmed and in the shoes, these tended to flop and not stay 'sealed' on the foot as I walked. Again my weird high arches. So I could not use them.
846. I can't take a lot of supplements due to the ingredients which end up doing more harm than good. I took these (and taking these) and have had zero problems. As for benefits, I can't say that I've noted any (unlike PQQ).Resveratrol has many health benefits and I was happy to give it a try. We are all different, perhaps others noticed a difference.This is made in the USA and GMP certified (I always look for that). This is a vegan capsule which is great. I don't get the addition of lemongrass but perhaps I'm missing something...There are 60 capsules here but the recommended dose is 2 per day so in reality this is a 30 days supply.
847. I am a side sleeper. When I first put the mask on, I thought it was going to be great. The material is nice and sleek and it fit well in the strap area. It was  a little too big over my nose. When I slept on my side, depending on whether or not the pillow was in a certain place, the mask buckled and felt uncomfortable. If I put my head into the pillow and didn't move, the mask was fine. So it was ok for naps but not for all night long.(The ear plugs did not work for me: they kept popping out)
848. I liked this hand lotion a lot. It has a 'waxy' feel to it, not greasy at all.  When you rub your hands with it, your hands don't slip at all. What I'm trying to say that while it is a hand cream to be rubbed in, it appears to absorb quickly and you're not left rolling your hands trying to get the lotion to disappear.It's so hard to describe smells. I liked the smell of this, it's lightly fruity. And a test I have with lotions is to rub it on at night and then see if the scent drifts over when I wake up. This lotion passed my sniff test, and I am very picky about perfumed products.
849. Just what we needed!
850. Well made as all Verilux items are, but also blends in well with other furniture!
851. They absorb way too much liquid, and theyre too long to be rung out properly. Sometimes the plastic rubs on the floor. Theyre ok for walls, but I prefer the original cedar ones for my floors.
852. I received this Brush for my Husband the other day and he tried it right out. He said the brush bristles were very soft and was easy to use to apply the dry oil. He said it turned easily in the oils and was easy to apply to his beard. His beard felt softer and it wasn't so rough looking. It keeps his beard soft and not old looking
853. This is the third time I have bought this product. The sticks that were in the bottle were no longer working. The sticks in the pouch did work but that meant 100 sticks did not on opening.
854. I used this for a Tiffany bridal shower. The paper was perfect color and quality of paper. Highly recommend
855. I bought this because I just needed the LED light. The one from Colgate was way too expensive and I already had crest white strips and the pen. This worked out just great. So far after one use for some reason I see my teeth look slightly lighter, not a huge difference tbh since it's one use. The LED was so simple to use, didnt cause burning or sensitivity to my gums or teeth. Would but again, but my concern was that It didn't come packaged. It came in a zip lock bag and I didn't see the warranty slip for mine. Can someone explain that to me?? I washed it before using as everyone should cause I was very suspicious about why it didn't come in a box like shown. I will continue using it this entire week.
856. I've lost and bent a few of these things.  It was nice to have a source of new ones.  They work fine and there's a nice assortment of sizes.  They arrived quickly and were well packaged.  There's not much else to say other than that they're remarkably inexpensive.
857. I love the fresh air smell.
858. The cart is well made with long handle for easy movement. I only give it 4 stars because the wheels are not tough enough for daily  city use. I had to change the wheels with lawn mower replacement wheels and now nothing can stop in my everyday use. why aren't more being sold.
859. THE ARE NOT ARCH SUPPORTED
860. Worked perfect, my stem had a broken screw and this part repair d it like new.
861. Love the oil, but the cap leaks.
862. The item fit way too big and the item could not be returned to seller. One hot mess
863. Works great as instructed.  Heating &#60;2 minutes and lasts 20-30 minutes.  Very gentle gradual heat release.  Size is just right for all body locations.  Great for period cramps back pain and other. Great packaging and fast shipping.  Recommend.  Thanks!
864. It works. It was fun and informative to see which waters were alkaline
865. Keeps the weight for a few seconds after you step off. Love it.
866. I have to say these are awesome glasses they fit really well and are so clear and the light-blocking is awesome as I spend a lot of time on my Kindle.
867. Really soften  my feet!
868. No support at all. Better off getting the whole foot support
869. Thank You
870. Ugly colors
871. I love this thing I sleep on it every night!!
872. I got one of these for myself a few months ago because I read they can help with scalp itch. I don't have dandruff, but I do have dry scalp (thanks Winter) and some irritation due to using dry shampoo. Admittedly it felt weird to use at first, but after just the first use, my scalp was itching less (after I added the use of an apple cider vinegar clarifying shampoo, the itchy scalp is GONE). It has made a noticeable difference in terms of scalp itch and how clean my hair looks and feels. I was excited and told my husband about my triumph over itchy scalp and the next thing I know, he has started using my shampoo brush (even though he made fun of me for using it in the first place)! He has some dandruff but doesn't have the itchy scalp. I'm not sure if it has helped him or not but he must enjoy using the brush because he keeps using mine. This is the exact reason I have now bought a second one. We both enjoy using it.
873. Can be used normally
874. Soap and probiotics soothe my skin after shaving
875. Good for a supplement to your diet
876. Just what I expected
877. Work just the way I wanted
878. They are what I expected and hold a lot of stuff without breaking!
879. These are great.  Best I found so far.
880. Great item, cleans your contacts really good
881. One side has floral covering not shown in photo. China Post shipping was S-L—O——W.
882. Keeping screens, glasses, and face shields is a never ending chore.These wipes do a through job without leaving streaks or film.So nice not to have to go back and try to polish again!
883. the rice was delicious.
884. These come in two sizes in the container.  Neither one of them fit.  They felt a little too stiff, not suitable for me.
885. Outstanding product as one would expect from Jocko. My family loves it, especially my teenage son. Will definitely be reordering and would highly recommend to ANYONE kids or not.
886. This is the only manufacturer that I have found that carries these larger interdental brushes.  They are necessary for my dental hygiene.
887. Menthol type of medicine, put 10-20drops into warm cup of water or juice, helps with sleep (has 65% alcohol) :) but we use it for indigestion, as a rub for colds, etc, just ahard to-get-product....
888. Very useful for my diet.👍🏼😁
889. very feature full cost effective shaver
890. Wow, this is a really heavy duty cover, very think.It covers my Pride Maxima 4 wheel scooter with room to spare.
891. Cheaper than my insurance copay. Works great.
892. A must have for any first aid kit!
893. I like plastic frames but they slide off my nose when I am working and looking downward. I thought I was going to have to get the side pieces extended, but I saw this and it works perfectly.  Although they seem a little flimsy, you get TEN pieces. Works like a charm, perfectly comfortable.
894. My partner likes to fall asleep to youtube, podcasts, and not the quiet kind either, music, laughter. I cannot tune that stuff out. Bought this pillow mat in desperation, not really trusting reviews, but it honestly and truly works. He puts it under his head and I can't hear a thing. I can't even tell it's on.  He says it's perfectly comfortable. Much more comfortable than headphones or headbands with speakers. Some people say the wire breaks after a lot of use. Honestly, I don't care. I mean, I hope it holds up, but since this is the only solution that works for us, we'll just spring for another one.The only downside is, he can't use it very well when he's sitting up in bed, so we need both headphones and the pillow mat.
895. Charge lasts forever! Fast Heating.Absolutely the best I have ever owned even comparing to others twice the cost.
896. It was a gift so I don’t know details but it was a pretty color.
897. Nice wrap, good length, strong Velcro closure, just too tight. Will give as a gift instead of my own use.
898. What an endearing book. It's as pleasant as drinking tea in the garden and kitchen with a good friend. This book is helpful, practical and fun. I would recommend it to anyone. Even though I have quite a few herb books, this was was a good addition. It has a clean feeling to it, simple and nice.
899. I'm a massive stroke victim with left  side paralysis so my care givers used these to wash  me.  I like that they can be warmed up in the microwave before using, they have a nice smell & r gentle for my skin.  A good thing to have on hand when a shower or bath is not aailable!
900. It does have an easy to read dial, works better for me than digital as i am handicap and it's difficult for me to step up straight on there, course the only thing I don't really care for is my weight as it says what I really am! lol
901. Great product and quick delivery!
902. Solid, cool looking trimmer.  Comes with 3 clip on bladecomb adjustments.  Rechargeable Li-On battery, it lasts for 2-3 hours- lit indicator.  single button. Strong cutting.  Trim the sideburns, trim the beard, eyebrows and cut designs in your hair if you want.  Nice gift for the guys.
903. I love taking long soaks weekly with salts.  Great for the circulation, body aches and mind.  This is a different combination.  I'm used to essential oils, but expect a stronger scent.  Not bad.  Overall, it was soothing.
904. I compared this with elderberry Emergen-C (EC).  The ingredients are similar as far as sugar 5g, Vit. D3 125% and 50mg elderberry.  This one has 25mg zinc(227%) compared with 10mg with EC; Vitamin C is low at 270mg, 1000mg EC. I like more VIt. C.  This one does have turmeric root extract 140mg which scores with me.  Salt is the 4th ingredient with 23% of daily sodium, 29% chloride.  That's a lot for me.  I definitely taste it.You absolutely need to mix this in 16ou of water.  It doesn't fizz.  Stir it.  Mild citrus taste.  Overall, not my cup of sport's drink or immunity drink.  I think if you're out sweating hard, like a lineman in a football game, or prefer more NaCl than this will work for you.  The ingredients and packaging otherwise look good.
905. Well, if you're looking for organic Acai, here it is.  It comes in a foil package, dish out how much you want or can stand,  I used to get frozen Acai mixed with fruit and guarana, or something like that.  Very tasty, and I felt like I was doing something really good for me.  This one isn't sweet.  It's kind of strong or bitter.  You must mix it with something to counter it and make it palatable.  I put it in my power shake along with the kitchen sink, i.e., you name it, if it's suppose to be good for you, I put it in my shake- one more powder.  I guess I like.
906. This is a hefty bag of organic turmeric.  It has that nice color and texture.  We use it in lots of food including protein shakes, salads, cooked dishes.  Anti-inflammatory powers and well tolerated.  This is a nice product for a decent price.  No complaints, will use more.
907. These work and I like them a lot.  They're pretty weak strength, but my eyes are still strong except if tired, low light or really small print, and then, these are perfect for me.  I have good eyesight but age tries to tell me otherwise.  I try to rest my eyes frequently from all the screen work that has taken over all  of our lives.  I do eye exercises especially for convergence.  I eat well, exercise, no smoke and take some supplements including fish oil.  Take care of your car, it last; take care of your body, it last.  God willing!
908. Very useful for foot pain, I've used Dr. Scholl's throughout m life with the occasional foot pain issues.  These orthotics saves one money and can bring relief for common problems.Visit the Dr. Scholl's kiosk to get the recommendation based on how you weight bare.  I've had problems with plantar fasciitis over the years when I haven't stretched and stayed limber.  I'm long legged, good arches, and skinny; however, weight can be a major cause of foot pain.  Even a little weight loss can significantly reduce the force on the feet.  I've also had inflammation at my metatarsal heads from wearing poor shoes- worn out sandals and working in the yard.I like these in my work shoes because they give my foot added arch support and cushion- heel and metatarsals.
909. Great photos & great write-up about the Blue Zones. Thanks!
910. Perfect for dog leash attachment. They gather all condition of poop to make bagging work easier.Very happy.They also clean up any broken glass dogs otherwise could be a victim of.
911. Use it in my office chair and is very comfortable except for the front edge which is under my upper legs. This edge tends to be a little hard and puts pressure on the back of my legs.
912. Comfortable to wear.  It helps my posture in a comfortable way.
913. I have a military back injury and this item worked and helped the pain, but after wasting my time and money getting 2 of them,  one originally, the other a replacement, they both stopped working and when they did work only 30 minutes at a time which was not very useful thanks for nothing this was a  bad product11
914. wonderful! It works..... only two days using the cream and my skin face is better,,,,
915. My wife loves these tissues...So soft
916. I have used Heel Tastic for over 3 years and it keeps my heels and toes from cracking.  You have to make sure it is Heel Tastic that you order.  I ordered one that I thought was Heel Tastic and it was useless.
917. This works wonderfully.  Hoping to have less colds this year!
918. Got these for my dogs and horses. Much cheaper than buying individual supplements. I use gram scoops for their servings.
919. This product made my wife's legs go numb.
920. Excellent callous remover.  Does not hurt foot and s rapes off stubborn hard skin on heels!
921. The flavour is very good and it keeps me feeling my best with better energy and digestion and I take it daily.
922. I was skeptical when I bought this razor due to the price...BUT, after using it for a couple of weeks, I can say that I really like this razor. Don't let the price fool you. The battery life is also very good. My last razor would have to be recharged weekly. Not this one. It arrived with 100% battery and I've yet to charge it and I still have plenty of battery left. I'd buy it again in a heart-beat.
923. Small size for purse or back pack
924. I have a 2 and 4 year old. I’m a nurse, and I love microbiology so I have studied which bacterias are commonly in the body, and which we need. This probiotic is very complete, and my kids are always very excited to eat one every night. They’re chewable and have a good taste, I tried one myself beforehand. I have had issues with others I have trued because they refuse to take them, so it’s a huge plus.Everyone should take daily probiotics, so overall I am very impressed and will keep purchasing them. Definitely recommend.
925. Back discomfort can be ongoing.  This really does get right to the points of tightness.  I would purchase it again or suggest it for a friend.
926. This is just an amazing system and it works! Try it. You also will be just astonished with the results. Well Done!
927. Great product would buy again.
928. Time will tell on the effectiveness but as of now not much difference in how I feel.
929. So far, I have seen a couple of strands spaced fairly apart on areas where I had lost all of my hair, which is good news. The bad news is that I also spotted some hair that grew about 34 of an inch below my eyes a spot where I never had hair before ? This is a minor inconvenience when it comes to shaving in the morning. This product does make your hair grow, but it works best where there is already some hair. I was hoping it would cover up my bald-spot, but other than a few new stray hairs, this hasn't happened. Not that it wont happen some time in the future. I only had this product for about 3 weeks, so I think I will give it another 3 months or so. In any case this is the best hair product I have tried so far.
930. great charger
931. great charger
932. Very disappointed in this product. Not rigid enough. Save your money and buy a horn without the spring.
933. It is so easy to use and works well. The recharging is quite fast and works for several times before it has to be recharged. I really like it.
934. This matters or not don’t waste your time but I won’t have to match them make it look like they’re tall the matches but then not
935. DMSO has been subjected to Government oversight, primarily based on Big Pharma monies.The product is amazing!We use it on a multitude of situations and we have NEVER been disappointed in the results.
936. This product is great quality and the multi purpose use of having an activated charcoal has been a bonus.I use this product for a pre-tooth paste.Having it on hand for a possible poison event was a good addition to the prepper suppliesmedical kit.
937. Great at a restaurant, or visiting  still can enjoy most drinks.  Good Product.
938. Works great!!!!!!!!!
939. Got samples of this product before buying. Flavors are in par; can be used with milk or water. Product was as described and seller had it out ahead of schedule. Would use seller again and will continue to use the product
940. Got samples of this product before buying. Flavors are in par; can be used with milk or water. Product was as described and seller had it out ahead of schedule. Would use seller again and will continue to use the product
941. Got samples of this product before buying. Flavors are in par; can be used with milk or water. Product was as described and seller had it out ahead of schedule. Would use seller again and will continue to use the product
942. Love this product.  Doesn't leak and holds quite a large amount of product
943. I really love this.  It really cleans the feet--just like having a pedicure
944. Talc,There is nothing I have ever found that smoother and talc. This new stuff you buy with cornstarch is terrible. Thank you for the great product.
945. Much heavier plastic bottles then I have purchased before.
946. Doesn't seem to work any better than othercheaper products I have used It takes the paindown about half, but Doesn't seem to last longa couple of hrs at most. I  haven't had it long so we'll see how it goes. So far it's over priced.
947. It tasted good, but was quite expensive
948. These are very soft and comfortable. I have wide hands and did not feel any restriction wearing them. I was able to keep them on all night. The gloves and Ancient Greek Remedy Oil helped my winter beaten, cooking, cleaning hands in one night. Better than any daytime hand cream, that really doesn’t fix the damaged skin.
949. Great nail files!
950. Easy and fun to use for creating many unique hairstyles, so happy I bought this!
951. B;ought for my wife--I have not heard her say any thing negative about it so I guess she is happy.
952. It's Imperative to get your omega 3's.
953. Didn't use it long enough to give a fair review.
954. Good item. Well bulit.
955. Don't need anyone to scrub my back with this product.
956. I started to use them as samples from my doctor. When I ran out, I could not find them anywhere except here on Amazon. There is not one person I gave this to, that has not thanked me. It is the best for my stomach on all sorts of issues and best of all its not a drug. It took care of some issues I had for over 2 years and nothing else helped. You will never regret getting this and taking it for anything related to your stomach. You will always find relief. I have bought exstra and givn them away. I am grateful it helped my symptoms of torture. I call it the stomach anesthesia
957. My husband really likes these glasses. He has a pair at work, at home, and in each of our cars so he's always prepared!
958. I gotta say I was a little hesitant buying this. At the time, there wasn't very many reviews and I base ALOT of my buying on the reviews of others. But I took a chance. The price point was pretty good for the amount of items you get. Everything came nicely put in a recyclable box, no plastic anywhere which is a big plus. The bags are nice and sturdy, as I have had the set now for about 6 months I think and everything has held up really nicely except the bamboo eating utensils. First off, if you are not used to eating with bamboo, its a big change. After several washings of the utensils, they became rough and unusable. I actually had to toss them. Food smell would still be imbedded even after washing and it wasn't something I enjoyed. The spoon ended up getting little slivers of bamboo that would fall out in my mouth or in my food. Ummm ya, no thanks. The rest of everything is still going good. Straws are nice, easy to clean. Came with the straw cleaning brush too. Overall, I think this is a nice starter set. This would make a great gift to anyone slowing doing their part to save our planet from the gobs of plastic that is killing it.
959. Good product.
960. SHIPPING: R & L Carriers. &#62;&#62;&#62;Top Notch. --I was very concerned about this after reading some of the reviews here. Use the tracking number provided by Amazon on the R & L Carriers website. My chair arrived 5 days early. --Relax, they do call you the day before and a signature is required. I tipped the driver $20 to wheel the palletpackage into my garage for the night (He came at 7:00PM !) --Treat the man nice, and he'll probably do the same for you.  Just don't expect him to bring it into your house. --He's really not suppose to go further than the edge of your driveway (where you put your trash cans.)SETUP: The driver gave me some awesome advice. Leave the chair in the box when you bring it in the house. Yes, believe it or not, by doing it this way, I was able to get this 244 pound beast inside all by myself !!! The secret is to slide the box where it is possible and &#34;walk&#34; the box where it is not. For my 4 step porch, I laid down a plywood sheet for a temporary ramp. The shipping straps made excellent handles and your chair will have protection all the way to your man-cave. Try it.  --You can always resort to cutting the box open if it doesn't work out.ASSEMBLY: Again, some reviews had me nervous. No sweat. Take your time &#34;eyeballing&#34; it. The &#34;non-removable&#34; retainer clips were already installed on the posts.--Not suppose to be, but they were. To solve the Chinese puzzle: Gently insert a small flat blade screwdriver in the very middle, twist slightly, slip the clipretainer off the post GENTLY. (It may take you 3 hands, 5 minutes, or both). These are suppose to be one-shot retainers and they WILL break easily.--There were no spares. Next, get the leg assembly as close as possible. Connect the 3 color-coded pneumatic hoses and 1 electrical connection FIRST. (Moistenlube the air connection fittings, it will help.) Slip the leg assembly support rings on the posts one at a time, then re-install the retainer clips. The AC power and controller cables easily connect on the bottom back of the chair. --You're now ready for lift off.THE RIDE: Holy smokes... No buyer remorse here.  This thing WILL have you smiling.  Heaven on your back and kinky on your ass. --Another reviewer put it perfectly: &#34;It works your butt over like a Greek.&#34; WARNING: Do not use more than 20 minutes (5 minutes in one specific area.) Yes, you will be tempted to ride all day, but like a hot tub, be sensible and don't over do it. --ENJOY.
961. your feet will feel much better
962. What a foursome!!!! These reading glasses arrived well before their scheduled time.. Packaging- they were well secured. and pricing .. Wow!! Well .....what can I say, you really won't regret this purchase. When I looked inspected each one I discovered they are Ingeniously crafted and I am so appreciative.  Bravo!!!! Bravo!!!! Bravo!!!! Bravo!!!!
963. Battery life is very short and there is not enough torque to really get in there and clean. It went in the garbage after the Battery died and would not charge (2 weeks).
964. Works well.
965. Feels good in your hand and is light weight, but squeaks very badly on shower doors and does not make a clean sweep of the glass.  Is not worth the price they are asking.  Streeks really bad also if your lucky enough to actually get the water off the glass.
966. Frankly the price has kept me away from this purchase for years. Cant afford more than one....BUT put on the lamp we use the most, what a wonderful difference for arthritic fingers!  Now we can turn lamp onoff without pain.  So worth it.
967. Thank you
968. Have drunk Noni juice for 20 years, and this one tastes pretty good and is half the price of my usual brand.
969. High quality capsules !
970. ....and it's about to expire.
971. I really like the eyelash curler but it's a bit pricy. I have very sparse eyelashes but like that this has a tension spring which helps to somewhat lengthen my eyelashes.
972. Reasonably priced and a great natural supplement to help ward off bad things.  Super fast shipping too!
973. good price. like them
974. The wax worked well.  My daughter's red Mustang is very shiny!
975. Need to make left side cradle larger to accept phones with protectors
976. This was easy to swallow.  Unfortunately, did nothing for me.
977. This inexpensive scale seemed to work OK for most of the first year after I bought it.  It tended to vary a bit from weigh to weigh, even within minutes, but seemed to be in the right ballpark.  It is attractive and very readable.  But then, at about the one year mark of ownership, the weight shown went out of whack, not by a huge amount, but by enough that I knew there was a problem.  I tried new batteries but that made no difference.  So I am throwing it away and have ordered a more highly rated and more expensive scale.  I'd like to get one that will last for years.UPDATE:  To my utter surprise, the company reached out to me shortly after I published the review above.  They processed an immediate and full refund to my credit card and have offered me a replacement scale.  I should have called them as soon as the problem developed, and I'm sure they would have replaced the scale then and there.
978. Love the Aria, it was easy setup and works great.
979. Ok product for covering eyes kind of small though.
980. ["91419, This Pine essential oil is pricey to start with and after reading various views sided to purchase. "][" The scent is not pine and the oilliquid is clear as glass where the ad shows an Amber type coloring. "]["Obviously whose affiliate ads are the most convincing to Amazon customers has nothing to do with the product sold, will send back."]["Inaccurate advertising is not the customers (re)sponsibility it's the sellers, and when deciding to send back the product  the printing cost of a label with shipping cost is not the customers' (re)sponsibility. Full Stop."]
981. Great for your glasses TV cell phone and many other things when wanting to be sure there’s no oily residue on items
982. It works, but I would' buy it again.
983. Very practical for cleaning between your toes. It does the job well.  I hope they make a longer handle someday.  I bought three.  Recommended.
984. I love how they feel and help my persistent dry and splitting heels, however, I'm reacting with a rash to the silicone against my skin so I've turned the socks inside out to wear them and put my regular sock over the top so I can slip into my shoes easier and keep my feet warm in these winter months.
985. Works nicely!
986. The Reishi really seems to give me a boost in energy! It is somewhat bitter, however, 14 teaspoon in a cup of coffee and it really isn't that bad. I feel I am getting use to the bitterness. Given the research, I am willing to put up with the bitterness for the health benefits.
987. It's the real deal love it
988. I took this product to my physical therapist. She tried to put it on and had great difficulty. It did not fit. It does not go low enough to support the back as well as pull the shoulders back. One person alone would have difficulty. My therapist does not recommend this product nor do I. I returned the product. The feedback I received from the seller said they are made to not go lower as people have big bellies.My therapist said she does not recommend any type of device as they are too difficult for the user to put on especially one with pain.
989. Super Nice!EasyFastWow! Lotsa Compliments!!!!
990. We are enjoying this as a thickening agent, from pudding to finger jello.
991. Tasteless, does not whiten as I expected
992. US Organic 100% Pure Frankincense Essential Oil - USDA Certified Organic - 10 ml is the way to go when choosing essential oils.  I appreciate the quality for the price, so many of my friends are very into the 'name brand' oils which I am sure have their benefits however I can't afford them and you only get the tiny little bottles. I was able to purchase this larger size bottle for more than half of what it would have cost to order thru their company.The amazing amount of health benefits that come with purchasing US Organic 100% Pure Frankincense Essential Oil - USDA Certified Organic are shocking, I have listed some of them below.1. Stress Relieving Bath-Soak2. Natural Household Cleaner3. Natural Hygiene Product4. Anti-Aging & Wrinkle Fighter5. Relieves Symptoms of Indigestion6. Scar, Wound, Stretch Mark or Acne Remedy7. Natural Cold or Flu Medicine8. Helps Relieve Inflammation and PainI was given a discount for  received this product for free under the conditions that I give my honest review.

993. Bought this for my Mother (93), because it was less expensive than another Collagen powder product she was using.She didn't like how it would not dissolve completely in the 'not steaming hot' coffee they serve at her SNF, so she sent it home with me and has stuck with her original brand.She also showed me how it would leave clumps, when she stirred it into her juices.I can't waste it, so I have been putting it on my two GSDs food, hoping they can get some use out of it.
994. Great little roller balls, and I love the color.
995. Seriously, a shoe horn!  What's so special about this?  First, not only can you not find these in any brick and mortar store, when I asked the sales people if they had a shoe horn, they looked at me like I had 3 heads!  Thankfully, I found this on Amazon and I must say, the is the most amazing shoe horn ever!  I have used shoe horns for years and my roommate said she wanted to get one, so I bought her this one.  But now I'm buying more for friends and family members because this is such a useful and well-made product!  The handle extends to the point where I don't even have to bend over at all (I'm 5'4") and the part you put your heel on is very comfortable and helps your feet slip into your shoes like "butta" (butter...LOL!)  Seriously, this is an amazing product!  Buy it!!!
996. I have been using this for almost 10 years now.  I love it.  Just wish the price would be more reasonable.  It's terribly expensive for such a small amount.
997. I have been using this product for 8 years.  It is the best shave cream on the planet!
998. It doesn't work as fast as CRAMP 911, but that product costs so much more per ounce this is by far the best value, you just have to endure the pain a little longer for this to work reminding yourself it got you a better price.
999. This solved my metatarsal arch ache but broke after 2 weeks....
1000. I appreciate this item!! I need these Gloves to do my limited shopping and other activities  such  paying my bills by going to the Post Office!!  Amazon thank you for listing this item in your inventory!!
