1. These backnobbers were given as gifts to several family members.  I have had one for years!  They are amazing!!  I use it almost daily and I can travel with it!  I HIGHLY recommend getting one so you can give yourself a back rub whenever you need or want for as long as you like instead of having to wait on someone else to do it for 30 seconds!  Buy one for anyone who has stress in their life!
2. Great make up remover. Smells nice.
3. After many years on a duty belt my old mask and glove case gave up this replacement was reasonably priced and fit extra gloves and mask without issues
4. I'm very satisfied by this charger and I greatly appreciate the built in safeguards it deploys. I was able to quickly weed out useless old Ni-MH and Ni-CD rechargeable batteries I have and refresh the good ones. The charge, discharge feature is phenomenal and has rejuvenated countless batteries I tossed in the drawer. It works flawlessly. I like the sleek look and I do believe I will buy another for my office at work. I highly recommend this charger.
5. Be very careful with this product.. I read the reviews that said there was no bad side effects, no jitters, etc. Yesterday I took half of one pill before lunch (to test) and that was the worst day I've ever had. I had to leave work early and spent all day in the bathroom with diarrhea. I had pain every 10-15 minutes in my stomach. I was about to go to urgent care but the pain started to appear every half hour or so. Had to miss work the next day.Please be careful with these pills! I am not sure what happened, but it might be that I am that sensitive to caffeine (and I drink soda a lot).
6. The "rabbit" portion was too long for me and the vibration so strong it'd make a jackhammer pleasurable. Not to mention it takes 3 hrs to charge but only lasts 1 hr.
7. Very nice scent and holds heat from microwave well. Love how soft it is.
8. So far out of all the diabetic bags I have purchased I keep coming back to this case. It fits my insulin pen, my napkins (when out to dinner and have a sanitary place to lay my stuff out), my meter pouch, alcohol wipes and needles. And it fits in my purse. I like it. and there is a small pocket to put an ice pack if needed.  I like it it so far. I just purchased the Sarah Spunda By Dittibags (also sold on Amazon) bag to see how that will work for my diabetic needs. Suppose to arrive today. I wanted something cute and feminine to carry my stuff but if the comments are accurate then I will be going back to this case!
9. Have not recieved this item yet but I love these batteries.  They don't last as long as other batteries but it is worth recharging them when needed.
10. Super soft and a good price.
11. I was so excited to try these. I love coffee and tea, so that's what I mixed them with, as per the packet recommendations. The flavors were...interesting and different than I expected. Not bad! but not exactly yummy either. I think I would have to experiment to dial in what works best with which packet to really enjoy them, and the price is too high for me to justify chugging them like a vitamin shot. If you enjoy earthy tones in your coffee or teas, then you will probably like them more than me; I will fully admit I am picky. I also didn't notice any immediate benefits after just 2 packages, so I probably won't be buying them again.
12. Everyone that see's this on my Dad just loves it.
13. Very comfortable and relievers pressure from hips and lower back
14. Daily dose of probiotics that is the good bacteria that your body needs. Easy to swallow and has no noticeable taste.  Completely vegetarian and loaded with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium probiotic bacteria, this digestive formula will balance intestinal flora and improve health and well being.
15. Love the product but my tin arrived in a dented box with no packaging inside. Lid of the tin was also dented. Disappointing. I want to take the vitamins so I didn't want to have to send it back and wait for a replacement.
16. Finally I found a great heating pad. This one has 6 heat settings and normally you would have to use the highest but not on this pad. Also the size is excellent. I have been looking for one like this forever. My neighbor is going to order one now as well. Thank you very much.
17. These wipes are nice & thick, they smell good also. An the price is good. I'm going to buy more because I always use wipes. An these are close to Cottonelle & Huggies  wipes. What I really like is that no white fuzz comes off the wipe. Buy these Wipes😊
18. Really nice and thick VG wexcellent taste. I use this in all my DIY projects,
19. These pills have a pretty pungent odor, but oddly I don't taste it or burp it up. I'm pretty happy with the results I'm getting after taking them for about a week. They're definitely useful for flushing out the system and the ingredients seem to be of good quality. I'd say they're worth giving a try.
20. The screw that holds the carbide tip is already rounded and difficult to unscrew.
21. I put it under my sheets and I hadn’t been sleeping well and I just told my husband I think there’s a lot of energy in the air or something. Because I feel wired.. well the very first time I slept on it I felt the relief…. Now I’m broke in and tell a small mount , however, if I forget to plug it in, I don’t sleep well,very noticeable.. I’m so glad I tried it..
22. This really works.
23. I have been using this for about 4 or 5 days and have not noticed anything, but I'm going to give it more time. I'm 52 and have bags under my eyes so am hoping this can help with them.After weeks of using daily I have not noticed anything.
24. More energy, kept me focused. Used this before workouts and work on computer.
25. Do not buy. This came half empty. This is a horrible deal for the price. Buy from someone else.
26. What is better than some Puff Facial tissues when you have a sore, runny nose? Nothing. These are soft and even contain some lotion, which means that hopefully you will be able to avoid that red, irritated nose that often results from a bad cold. The cube shaped box contains 52 soft tissues. This 10 pack can be divided and used in multiple places. I have a box on my desk at work; one in my car; and others strategically placed around my house.
27. We purchased this for our baby's room. We already had one for our own bedroom and loved it. Totally drowns out the sounds of life outside the window and allows for a deeper sleep.Our baby now associates the noise machine with sleeping and her eyelids start drooping the moment we turn it on.Four stars because it does seem that the noise gets softermuffled after a few months of use. I thought maybe this was just me going deaf, but I don't think so. The new one we got for the baby is definitely louder than our old workhorse. I also think the holes in the machine that are supposed to allow you to vary the volume of sound don't really do enough. There is a noticeable difference in volume but not enough range.Updated review February 2017: One of our machines has developed a truly irritating rattle. It took a couple days of terrible sleep before I figured it out. Like another reviewer mentioned, it seems better if the machine is on an angle, but the rattle is so unpredictable. I'm ordering a replacement and hoping this is just the result of years of nightly use and not some sort of manufacturing quality issue. Our device and the newer one we got for our daughter are identical and we've moved them around enough that we don't know which was the original anymore.
28. This stuff works wonders !
29. Although I haven't used Coppertone for years, this certainly is the smell that I remember from way back when. Those days before an SPF was listed on the bottle, the days when there were billboards with the little girl with the tan line as the dog tugged on her bathing suit bottom.For Nostalgia alone, I would like this product. The fact that it feels much better going on than I remember the old ones to be, is a big plus.It has an SPF of 30, and since I usually use it around a pool, the fact that it's water resistant is also very nice.Just remember to put it on as the label suggests, applying at 15 minutes before sun exposure, and reapplying after swimming or at least every 2 hours.
30. Beware these don't just fit any eyelash curler.
31. My wife loves these tissues...So soft
32. If you ever have suffered from constipation, then you already know that there are a lot of products available to make your bowels work easier the next morning. This is the stuff that is in many of them. If you need fiber, you psyllium husk, if you need to ease constipation, you use senna.
33. Delicious! I must be the only person who likes the taste of this stuff!
34. Just as described very pleased
35. My boyfriend swears by tart cherries in any form.  I've read a lot about them and sour cherry reduces inflammation and muscle soreness, helps with insomnia, and prevents gout (a form of arthritis).  Inflammation is my middle name so I wanted to try this. Although, I don't have gout, I do have arthritis in various parts of my body. I also have daily muscle aches and inflammation (which was recently verified by a doctor), yet after consuming these capsules for a couple of weeks, they have had no effect either good or bad on me. I should be finished with the bottle in another two weeks.  The positive is that I did not have any side effects.  I've used Nature's Bounty red yeast rice and although that product worked for me to lower my cholesterol, I had a permanent nasty side effect from it. Therefore, I consider the absence of any bad effects with this supplement a big plus. On the other hand, I've had no reduction in soreness or inflammation so it's like taking a placebo for me.  It does appear this tart cherry concentrate works for some, so I suggest anyone considering this give it a try.Depending on how many pills are taken per day, this bottle provides a 60, 30, or 20 day supply. The recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills per day with meals. The max I've taken was 2 per day.I called Nature's Bounty to understand why the bottle says 1000mg equivalent on the front, yet the back says 250mg per capsule. What the fellow say to me was that the powder is concentrated and the 250 is the weight if you were to empty the contents of the capsule. However, he said since it is an extract, these compressed components are equivalent to 1000mg per capsule. Whether this is really true or not, I have no idea.As for the ingredients, besides the tart cherry (prunus cerasus) fruit extract, each capsule also includes vegetable cellulose and less than 2% of silica and vegetable magnesium stearate. This is suitable for vegetarians.
36. Did not stay secure on walker, had to return
37. My husband is so tight in the pocket he squeaks when he walks.He washes and disinfects and stores plastic neti pots.Great, but when I need one, I just cannot bring myself to use someone else's snot washer. I mean, really?This is a good deal nicer, and it's not going to break my bank. If you are really strapped for cash, there are videos on how to flush your sinuses without spending any money at all. For my sensibilities, this two pack is great.
38. Great stuff slept well did not wake up hung over (use 14 bottle.)  The problem is - my roommate keeps taking them.
39. Awesome toilet paper! I love Charmin big rolls like this. They last a while in the household.
40. I thought it worked well in the beginning but later it failed to help with the leg cramps.
41. Cheap quality
42. This product was okay...it does leave your skin feeling baby soft, definitely recommend it to friends- you still have to use an additional cream afterwards to prevent stubborn ingrowns.
43. Makes it so much easier to get around when using a walker
44. I really like this toothpaste. You only need a little so it last a long time. Seems to be whitening my teeth. I am allergic to SLS and have had no reaction. Wish it was less expensive, but other than that I love it.
45. Informative, lightweight & sturdy
46. It is a fine product but a little shaky when I had to use it.It needs a counter balance-weight.
47. My husband made the mistake of thinking he didn't need to clean stainless steel bottles if he only drank water out of them. He figured rinsing was good enough. Then he looked inside the bottle with a flash light. This product saved his bottles! I use it on my daughter's hydroflask, does a great job. I wish the handle was a little longer and the brush part was a little bigger, but it works.
48. It took me a while to figure out how to really use these. Basically the idea is just to push in (much like fingernails). The problem is you have to push pretty hard and they can easily hurt you. It's not really easier than pushing your skin with your fingernails unfortunately. I will keep trying to get better with them. However if you have easily broken skin I would suggest being very, very careful in attempting these.
49. This seems identical to the name brand version but at a better price.
50. Great glasses! Nice style!
51. Perfect case for my pulse ox. Now I can keep up with it better.
52. These are so cute and a great value for the money. I have two daughters, so the 4 pack is perfect - we can usually find 2 at bedtime. They’re adorable and my girls LOVE them!
53. A little pricey but does what it says.
54. Excellent product. I have very thin, sensitive skin, and using band aids usually causes more damage. I was getting desperate when I saw these. I had to use them this week and they are perfect for me. They are truly made for sensitive skin, come off easily, and do no damage, and they stay on until you take them off.
55. I have been using a water machine to alkalize and purity the water for several years.  My research shows that it removes many minerals along with the chlorine and fluoride which is why I purchased it.  So, using the Purely-Min is my way of replacing the minerals.  I have used this brand of herbs and spices (North American Herb & Spice Co.) for many years and it is one of the best.  Nice to see that Amazon is selling it.
56. This supplement is utilizes a blend of ingredients that increase energy and increase alertness.What’s in it:Thiamin: Vitamin B1, thiamin, or thiamine, enables the body to use carbohydrates as energy. It is essential for glucose metabolism, and it plays a key role in nerve, muscle, and heart function.Riboflavin: Vitamin B2 is a water-soluble vitamin that is flushed out of the body daily. It helps the body break down carbohydrates, proteins and fats to produce energy, and it allows oxygen to be used by the body.Niacinamide: a form of vitamin B3, an essential nutrient that supports many cellular processesIt uses an enormous dose of B12 and B6.B6: one of the B vitamins that benefits the central nervous system. It is involved in producing the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, and in forming myelin.B12: may benefit your body in impressive ways, such as by boosting your energy, improving your memory and helping prevent heart disease.The proprietary blend contains about the amount of caffeine as the average cup of coffee.Guarana Seed Extract is used for weight loss, to enhance athletic performance, as a stimulant, and to reduce mental and physical fatigue. It is a frequent addition to energy and weight loss products.L-Tyrosine may improve mood and cognitive and physical performance.Eleuthero Root Extract: Eleuthero is also commonly called Siberian ginseng.  Often used to boost energy, metabolism, and physical performance.I found this supplement to be very effective. In my experience I would not recommend taking it within 10 hours of bedtime.  Based on the enormous dose of several of the B vitamins I wouldn’t recommend taking this supplement regularly but as an occasional supplement it definitely works.⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

57. Was very happy with this product and seller. Would buy again.
58. Because of the way I have my desk and computer set up, I lean on my left elbow while at my computer. IN addition, my husband does most of the driving and while in the car, I tend to lean my left arm on the arm rest. Soon, I had a problem. I essentially developed a &#34;bed sore&#34; on my left elbow, and no matter how many creams and tender loving care I gave it, I couldn't seem to get rid of it. Then I found and purchased this item (2 in fact -- one for desk area, one for car), and in no time, my elbow began to clear up. It took off the pressure, and gave the creams and ointments time to do their work. I like the idea that my arm doesn't overheat, because of the mesh that keeps most of the arm cool. Other styles didn't have that.  The pad slips around a little, but not badly, and easily moves back into place.  I keep the computer one on a small shelf that is part of my desk, and the one for the car, I keep in that built-in &#34;side-pocket&#34; in the door. I told my dermatologist about what I was doing, and he thought it was brilliant!  Hope it works as well for you!  (if you found this helpful, please click where noted below, and thanks!)
59. I Love them! Can't wait to finish my doily so I can block it.Much better than using a padded towel!!
60. These were exactly as expected.  They are vitamins; melt fast, too.
61. Very handy for soaking my night guard.
62. It does not work at all, I wasted money!!
63. Unable to use until repeatedly washed. Had odor.
64. I use kinesiology tape on my bad knees, and I had hoped this stuff would be a support to my back while I try to reduce my belly.  Yeah there's one born every minute.  You get ONE!!! application that is not reusable.  The information says that it can be used for multiple days.  I don't know how to express how dumb that statement is.  Pregnancy doesn't last a couple of days folks.  It's not a sprint, it's a marathon.  You'd need to buy these every few days at best.  But if you use kinesiology tape you know that it's likely to peel up or loosen well before that.  So you're paying for one or two days of relief which you probably won't even get.Just don't, okay?  Get one of the ones that are reusable.
65. I honestly thought this was the worst thing I have ever tasted. It did not taste like vanilla or chai. It honestly tasted like dirt. I have not tried the other flavors. It is a bit too expensive. Even for a sample pack.
66. Very nice love the moist heat... need to manipulate beads into parts is only negative
67. I searched for a good amount of time looking for vegan gummy fiber vitamins for my 3 year old.  He loves them and looks forward to eating them!  He thinks they are candy!!
68. Read the reviews and thought I'd give this a try... first flavor I tried: Pina Colada - smelled great but after the first taste I had to throw it away. It left a terrible after taste. Thankfully, the variety pack had two more flavors. Yup, they ALL have WEIRD metallic after tastes. Terrible. Would NOT recommend.
69. I wasn't a fan of this because it gave me the jitters!
70. Love this product very refreshing
71. This is perfect for college students and anyone wanting to meal prep or store left overs. I love how the containers stack together easily to keep a clean cabinet. Comes in a set of 30 which I will actually be using at the neck family gathering to store leftovers for guests to take home instead of using zip lock bags. Easy to clean and store away. I've been using these for a while and they were a lifesaver in college. Glad I can get these in bulk here. Highly recommended! As a warning, if you do microwave pasta, the sauce may stain if it's tomato based. I usually have designated o es just for that reason. Other than that, it's perfect to freeze and reheat your meals in.
72. I have to say, I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but did so because it received great reviews.  And I am here to give another one.  My teeth do not whiten easily due to meds taken as a toddler. Nothing has worked.  I have been using DReow for about 5 days and my granddaughter said, &#34;You're teeth look so much whiter&#34; one day when I picked her up!  Thanks again.  I love it!
73. These provide some support for my bad knee but ultimately they don't have any side support to stabilize my knee. These are probably better for light walking and some gentle exercise. Though they have compression support, it doesn't prevent side twisting motion which is how I can hurt my knee. I don't really think there is anything special to copper infused compression sleeves. It kind of reminds me of the magnetic bracelets they sell that boast claims but have no real science behind it.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review.

74. As soon as we opened this product we realized just how cheaply it was made. We did however attempted to use it for a week. At the end of that we week we through all three of the items in the trash.
75. works out good for me not quite the one I wanted but it will do.i carry a portable tank of oxygen with me and it fits down in there perty good.
76. Work very well with my machine. My old ones developed a 'quirk' where the wire plugged into the unit. Now it works again. The item arrived quickly which was a good thing as I really needed a dependable set of wires at the time. Those who use a tens unit know what I am talking about. The price was super reasonable for 2 sets and they shipped free with prime.
77. It is so rough and tore off my skin and started to bleed while i was walking. Had to remove it Midway and it was sticking to the socks. Bad experience and now I have to wait for healing before I put on my shoes. And these happened within 2 Miles walk. Never buy it if you have soft skin
78. I like all of the egg white protein bars from Julians Bakery.  These do have a strong cinnamon flavor if you like cinnamon.  My favorite are the Devils Food Chocolate and the Glazed Donut.  The Sunbutter is an excellent choice too.
79. Nice to have to store batteries but wish it was not all these little parts.  Maybe combine two together.
80. Item arrived very promptly, and as described by seller.
81. My husband bought me a pair of these I had saved to our list. As some other reviewers have said, they fit phenomenally. I have small ears and have a difficult time finding earplugs or earbuds that fit. Usually they will pop out or hurt my ears. These for just right and I can wear them for hours without any problems. I liked mine so much I ordered these for my mom. She has the same issues with earplugs and earbuds, but adores these. Thanks so much!
82. I purchased these to replace discolored nose pads on my old glasses. (Nose pads absorb oil from your skin and yellow with age.) These are great -- very soft and easy to install. You will need a tiny screwdriver to install them. For 2 pairs of glasses it took about 10 minutes to remove the old pads and replace them with these.
83. 3 Andrews - Boot WaxThis stuff resurrected a pair of hiking boots that I love, but that definitely had seen better days. The boots were scuffed and dried out looking, but now look almost new. I used a rag to rub a little of the leather conditioner into the boots, let it sit for a few minutes, then buffed with a clean cloth. The boots look darker than they did before treating them, but probably like they did when they were new. Scuffs and scratches disappeared and the boots look incredible. Give it a try if you have leather you think is beyond help…you’ll be surprised!
84. This review is based on my experience. So I've tried several silver lozenges and I believe the Manuka Honey from American Biotech is the best. I wish they made it with agave syrup for those watching their blood sugar. Just buy it already, lol.
85. My purchase arrived on time, and I’m very happy with my product.
86. I do like kuumba but its always a hit or miss. I've purchased a few different kinds and one may hold its scent and smell lovely while others have absolutely no smell whatsoever.  Its unfortunate.
87. Nice and small
88. This did clean my clothes on a recent trip to Europe but then my sister used it and her hands we wet so it turned into a lump we had to just use.  The direction very clearly state you must use with dry hands - so pay attention to that and you should like this product.
89. This Heated Hair Straightener Brush is okay. I didn’t like the very small section that the hair should go into to straighten. I have a place in the back that has a little curl, but the rest of my hair is straight. This straightener did not straighten that part of my hair.The box comes with a straightener brush with a power cord. The handle has a power button and two buttons for raising and lowering the temperature. Instructions are included.I will not be recommending this Heated Hair Straightener Brush to family and friends.
90. Took for a month now still no change it's kinda disappointing you spend money hoping for something but there is no drug that makes miracle happen
91. I bought this iron because it had great reviews and I keep seeing the THYME flat iron in my facebook feed, but didnt want to spend a fortune on trying it out.  It takes some getting used to, you do need to twist the iron as you go but not much. I did get an instant curl, though you have to be careful not to flatten too much (hold in place too long). THe iron seems like nice quality, easy to turn on and change temps, and I like the lights as it heats up. It is pretty too, and has a good weight to it. I just got it so I cant speak to it lasting, but for the price I am happy!
92. I like the idea but I never figured it out. Three them away
93. For the supplement explorer, the D3-K2 combo has been perfect. Both are vital. Both are micro-volumedose. Excellent design.The D3 blood test came on the scene as a routine blood panel. I knew that skin produces like 100K times more D3 than science imagined that the body needed. I grew up in Miami enjoying more sun skin time than anyone had the right to absorb. I was shocked! Shocked I tell you ... to discover that I was short D3. How could this possibly be?Whatever, I'm happily in the 'normative range' thanks to supplementation. The implications of K2 are still a bit new, but trust me ... you likely need it.
94. Love the ease of these
95. Very good product. Expecting the maker keeps its integrity. It does help with a variety of health issues, with reliability. I highly recommend this product. The reason for the only four stars is because the seller has increased considerably the price of it. I will be searching for other options, although I trust this specific brand. I appreciate the seller's delivery, also.
96. This scarf is just beautiful and it is lightweight which makes it perfect for spring and summer.  The quality is also very good.
97. Problem with this belt is, you warm up the packet and it can get lava hot. BUT, you cannot feel it through the too thick super synthetic material of the pouch. So once the super hot gel pack is inserted into the pouch, you barely feel it.:- I was looking for one with cotton pouch and clay beads, but they were too $$,& had bad ratings. This would be great if the pouch was different to transfer the heat from the gel pouch. Plus, after a few times in the microwave, the gel seems to be burning through the lining of the gel pack. So it might not have great longevity, as well.
98. Great purchase.
99. Got the layers of grease off the cabinets from the place I rent. Couldn't stop touching the cabinets because they felt like new! Careful though, on certain surfaces it can abrasive.
100. I am buying another one because this was VERY NEEDED! I can actually walk around the house without my knee brace, given by the hospital, at home! It's also added support with my knee brace.One HUGE MISTAKE was washing it. Do they expect it to never be washed???So, ordering a new one. And this time reading washing instructions or washing by hand next time.
101. Lovely scent. Soft, silky, powder. Terrific quality, as Avon products always seem to have.
102. A positive difference noticed within the first day of use.
103. These are excellent towels for certain cleaning tasks. They are thin, but absorb quickly and hold a decent amount of water. They can be rinsed, laid flat to dry, and re-used several times, making them go a lot further than a roll of conventional paper towels.They are ideal for certain cleaning tasks, especially windows, glass, smooth tile and other types of smooth surfaces. They are not, however, all that good for scrubbing or use over a rough surface. They can be used for that, but the roughness will shred the towel making it only good for one use. If used on smooth surfaces, they can be rinsed and re-used multiple times.For me, these are ideal for washing windows. I use a few sheets of these towels with cleaning liquid to get the dirt off the window, then use a single microfiber cloth for a final dry and polish. The used towels are rinsed and set aside to dry for the next task. I can usually get 4 or 5 uses out of a single towel before it starts to shred up.My only quibble is that I don't care for the graphics printed on the towels. They aren't bad looking, just unnecessary. Other than that, no complaints. They work well, last a good amount of time, eliminate the waste of using one-time use paper towels, and are a good value compared to other similar towels (as well compared with  conventional paper towels since one of these towels can take the place of many one-time use paper towels).
104. barley any power... didnt last long
105. We grilled the 12 lb burgers we got from the Treasure Truck and they were AMAZING! Everyone loved them. We just got the hot dogs and sausages today and I’ve heard good things about those, too. Can’t wait!
106. Definitely can tell a difference in pump when using this product versus not. Some over stimulated after if you take it to late.
107. I really like these.  In just a day you notice a change in your appetite.  But you don't get that caffeine high like some other products.  My energy level has also picked-up.  Great product.
108. We use cotton ball for different things around the house- we like our crafts and beauty supplies so it's good to have some on hand. These are pretty much what you would expect of cotton balls only they are a bit more smaller (but slightly more dense) and a bit more expensive (currently $4.99)
109. Doesn't seem to be catching enough hair or fur!
110. This is a pretty and functional dowsing board A circle of lightweight wood it features attractive center illustrations and large, readable responses. The back is plain and there is no carrying case, bag or box. It is nice and functional  It also comes with a complimentary ankh pendant, vintage style postcard and little thank you banner.
111. Little to no force required, durable, file on the handle is a nice touch!
112. These don't appear to be real jade but for the price, they work as I anticipated. Soothing and comforting, moves lymph and gives a temporary plumping appearance, like one would get after a facial or massage.
113. I usually use Ayer Gel Nadal Spray when I travel on planes.  It's the best way to fight getting sick from traveling.  Keeping your nostrils moist and breathing through your nose is the key to fighting airborne germs.  I used this nasal spray on my roundtrip flight to Canada.  This spray works well but I had to keep reapplying it.  The Ayer Gel spray seems to coat my nostrils better but this spray works well for daily usage.  I will continue using the thicker gel Nadal spray on planes but I well use this at work and home because it does moisturize my nasal passages when my nose doesn't completely dry out which happens on flights.
114. I added this to my smoothie, its got a great, definitely, I definitely recommended this to everyone who wanted to live a healthy and happy life style plus super fast shipping. Great seller.
115. I really enjoy This scale even though it does lie lol
116. Works good not to strong but strong enough
117. Don't know yet just got it.
118. Really great but the sand timer takes a long time to go down, like 3+ minutes.
119. I had never used a pumice stone before, so the fault is mine. I should have ordered a finer- grain stone. On this one the little holes are so big they are not gentle to my feet.  However the item arrived on time and as described.
120. I love these.  I worry a lot about traditional sponges and germs and saw these and thought why not try them. They are amazing and so easy to disinfect. My favorite feature is that one has a built in scraper which is perfect for my stoneware cookware. The little hooks are a nice added touch. I gave one to my mom and she is hooked!
121. I do not recall having any nose plugs as a child, but I guess they would have been made out of dinosaur parts if we did.  The kids love them, so that's all that counts.
122. I AM NO LONGER WORKING I.N HOSPITAL BUT I USE IN A FREE CLINIC  FOR HUMANS AND ANIMALS
123. So far they seem to do the trick. My daughters gaite is offand she has flat feet (non verbal, autistic) Her doc suggested inserts and i bought these. She's doing so well she even attempts to run now. I'll probably need to buy a few more.
124. Lovely one.  Convenient, comfortable and easy to use. Love it.
125. Barley Max has a pretty good taste but when they added the mint I couldn't hardly drink it.  It has a sweet taste.  It just doesn't work.  I will continue to get Barley Max without the additional ingredients.I will say that this is an excellent product for adding greens to the diet.
126. This is my fifth pair of Lollop compression socks. However, two of the pairs are a smallmedium size and three are medium large. This is a mediumlarge and runs a bit big.I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a medium  large size which is supposed to be for that size foot. However, they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle. They do fit around the calves nicely, however.I love that they offer medium compression (15-20 mmHg) around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches. I felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs. I also like the "normal sock" look of these knee-highs and they wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry. The blue hearts are very attractive even though the off-white is a bit dingy looking. I consider these socks very stylish. The material is 45% cotton, 40% nylon, and 15% spandex.If the sizing was specified correctly, this would have gotten 5 stars. 
127. My daughter likes to wear stylish sneakers that don't have a lot of arch support. She recently came home from college for a visit and only brought the shoes she wore with her which happened to be a pair of these shoes. She was using our home elliptical machine and complained afterwards because the shoes weren't very supportive. I ordered these for her to see if they would help. These inserts are customizable. They can be trimmed for fit and then there are little pieces that you can add under the arch area in case you need to increase the arch support. She says that they do improve the arch support, but she would prefer one with extra cushion support in the heel and other areas, too. Overall, she does like these and is much happier with her shoes since she's added these.
128. Almost the same, but perhaps not quite as thick, as standard dishwashing gloves you might get from the grocery store.  And maybe not quite as long in the sleeves as some others, either.  Regardless, they have plenty of great uses around house house, including working on the car.  Anything to cut down on the clean-up time.
129. Great quality and REALLY does the job on my car carpet. Bought a second one for my truck and keeps the run looking great!Who does a review on a brush but so cool, I had to take a minute.
130. I haven't been using this long, so far just once a day. I'm a little confused on dosing. There isn't any information regarding it on packaging other than add 1 scoop to your juice, smoothy or whatever. It says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract powder. Is that just weight, or is that the actual amount. Because.. that is 3000 mg of this extract otherwise-- which is higher than some other similar products out there. Maybe the serving size just happens to be larger where as the others are smaller with expectation to use it 2-3 times a day. This lack of clear info is frustrating. Hopefully other reviewers can comment on that.As for how it works. Well, I am not exactly sure what I am looking for it to do and how to measure my experience. I know it has been an ingredient used in weight loss formulations, and I sure could stand to lose several pounds, but I'm not sure about that for reviewing easily. Reading through some potential benefits like better digestion, better concentration, reduced food cravings, loss of appetite, reduced joint pain, improved cholesterol levels,  better mood, etc.. I figure the one I can measure best is the food cravings. I know what my habits are, and I will know if my desire for sugary foods reduces. So if I notice a reduction, then I can attribute it to this. So far, not feeling that, BUT it is early on and I have taken but one serving a day. I will give it a little more time and report back. Your desires for taking this as a supplement may vary from my own. There is no shortage of info on what this fruit is or its purported benefits are, as well as risks (such as do not take if have dementia or Alzheimer's) - so please read up. I know I am still learning.ACTUAL PRODUCT: So I will tell you more about the product itself. It is an 8 ounce bag of  garcinia cambogia extract powder. It is a resealable Mylar bag with a front window so you can see how much is in there. It comes with a small scoop, which is one serving. In my pic it shows the little scoop and the amount dumped into my hand. There are 76 servings in a container. If you plan to use it in liquid, plan to use a shaker cup or your blender. Just stirring it in will not work. I included a pic and you can see all the powder just sitting on top. Strangely, my spoon stayed dry. So that is when I got out the shaker cup and all blended fine with that.The taste is absent to me. Not sure if it supposed to have a noticeable flavor or not. The fruit is tart and I hadn't noticed a tart flavor with this. Maybe my taste buds are off. Seems that it will go well with yogurt, oatmeal, blended into smoothies, added to soups, broths, baked goods. I have been just consuming it with plain water or some organic lemonade in a shaker cup- because like I said, it doesn't mix by just stirring. The powder is fine, and not at all gritty. I'll likely add it into my next smoothy. I haven't tried it blended in with coffee- next time I will do that. I imagine if you like to fill your own capsules that this powder could work for that, but I don't know for sure.Everything about it seems fresh and of quality. I received it in 92019 and it has an expiration date of 32020; 6 months from now.  If I figure out anything else, I will be back to update. 3 stars because I need more time with product. Also I have no idea what the price is, and lack of info is concerning.
131. Got for my DIL and she loved it!!
132. I have short, curly, thick hair this brush works perfectly to help keep it under control. Love it
133. Very easy to use and shipped really quickly!  We’ve only had them for a few days, but they work perfectly.
134. I have not used these yet but they seem good, heavy quality at a great price
135. How hard is it to create a scent that smells like the label and doesn't make your eyes water,  nose burn and coat your throat like vapors from a tire fire?  I've been very discouraged by all the Glade refills I've tried. Harsh, unpleasant and only a passing resemblance to the claims on the label.
136. Started having frequent nosebleeds and I keep one in my car, in my purse by the bed! Hospital charged my Dad 79$ for one of these so this is a deal!
137. This has really helped my success with THM so far. Knowing that I can make a dessert that's safe and yummy saves my sanity.
138. This is my third main warmer. I love it and it’s worth the money.
139. There are four colorful compression socks in this package. I wear a 9-10 shoe so I selected the largex-large size. A compression rating of 20-30mmhg is supposed to be firm and strong; however, the compression is very light. Also, the toe box feels as if it is sewn awkwardly on the sock. It is not uncomfortable, but has to be adjusted just so to feel best.I wore these all day and they look and feel great. These colors are fun and the socks feel almost like regular knee-highs.  Overall I do like them but I took off one star for not feeling like a compression rating of 20-30mmhg and another star for the weird toe box.
140. I bought this +- 20 years ago (not from amazon) and its still going strong!  I have thin, wispy hair and this keeps it all up in a bun very nicely and for hours.Recommend this.
141. I love how great it cleans and how wonderful it smells
142. We used it a few times and it just stopped working
143. It actually works, it's not a quick relief but it takes the headache away. It does not feel greasy or sticky.
144. great buy! perfect size for a variety of uses. the included earplugs are nice too
145. Bought this when I was a little strapped for cash and needed wick for my attys. This works extremely well. No wicking time, very soft, very workable and it is economically sound. I love my Cotton Bacon and Torii Wicks, but I definitely will stock up on these and keep them in my supply.
146. love this for tender aching feet. big enough not to spill over
147. Great alternative soap.
148. Simple, natural, and organic ingredients. The flavor is good; they taste like other honey lemon lozenges I've tried before. They even have silver with helps fight off infections. Definitely handy to have and work well for fighting off sickness.
149. Ok for a temporary fix.  Buy a new chair.  Better yet, make your company buy one.  OSHA
150. I love the size. I love this product and I would purchase it again.
151. I diet and walk for 30 minutes a day 5days a week. It's not a miracle pill. But if you change your eating habits and get a little active it will work over time.
152. Have to nail on and remove old heel taps, mehhhhh
153. I have a model 454 that must be at least 30 years old, and it keeps on going.  I've tried electric white noise makers over the years, but they just aren't the same.  Can't really explain why, they just aren't.  When mine finally conks out, I'm definitely going to get another one!  I live in a noisy area, a bad one too with gunshots, loud cars, noisy neighbors and the like, and this unit does an amazing job keeping the noises down.Just did a Google search for the model 454, I got this..."It is billed as, "Sleep-Mate" by Marpac of Wilmington, N.C.. It is model number 454.This item is circa the 1960's. "1960's!!!  Wow, guess it's lasted longer than I thought!
154. There is hate but this is like the classic Mac and cheese but I liked it more. Just your basic tasting noodles and fake cheese powder. Give it a try.
155. I threw these away almost as soon as I opened them up.  Way too short!  Didn'tt fit at all.
156. It’s very difficult to rate any vitamin tablet unless it’s toxic. I have taken these for three days now and nothing has happened to me. I can only assume that they are valid Vitamin D3 and generally are good for aiding in the absorption of calcium and may be helpful in the prevention of osteoporosis and osteomalacia. As we get older, this Vitamin is vital for keeping our bones strong so that if and when we fall, our bones will not break or not break as badly were we not taking Vitamin D3.I have a history of falling and in fact have fallen many times because of a balance issue. I have been taking Vitamin D3 for 10+ years and have yet to break any bones. A bone density test revealed that I have excellent bone density for  a man of my age.I find taking Vitamin D3 very good for me and my PCP is adamant that I take D3 every day.
157. Felt great on scalp! Would definitely recommend
158. Have you ever been in a public restroom where they've run out of soap?  For some of us this is a nightmare, and this little  item is an answer to our prayers!  They are very convenient to have in your purse and one sheet is all it takes to get your hands nice and clean.
159. I ordered this for my furbaby, as water through a dropper, is the only way he will drink water. Droppers alone,  are really hard to find in stores around here. Usually the dispenser for giving meds to kids is included in package and the price is higher than here at Amazon. So far it serves the purpose  for which I purchased it. Also I found a small brush that fits into the dropper for thorough cleaning. Well worth the purchase.
160. It’ll take me forever to use all of these tags. But they are gorgeous. Exactly what I was looking for.
161. Very nice dispenser and I keep it in my kitchen because it is a much more economical way to keep and use paper towels .
162. PROS1. Vegan, with no gelatin.2. Tastes good, fresh and chewy.3. Moderate price range.4. No iron.5. Contains iodine, which is important for thyroid health.CONS1. This is a basic, gummy, adult multivitamin. You can obtain a very similar, generic version through your local big box store for about one-third the price of this product.
163. I usually check my blood pressure whenever I'm at a pharmacy or location with the little sit down booth. I got this so I could monitor my bp at home to get an idea of my readings to keep better track. It is easy to use, fits my &#34;larger&#34; arm with no issues. It has really great memory settings for 2 people. Very comfortable and my readings are very consistent.
164. Love the bottles and the color is gorgeous
165. Nice quality and quite sturdy. Will see how will hold over time and under shower conditions
166. SSOOOOO uncomfortable!  The thick Velcro straps double back under your armpit and it's like having 2 belts wrapped up under your arms, miserable, I couldn't wear it 10 minutes.
167. Happy with how affordable this is and that it’s wireless
168. Extremely uncomfortable. I’m a bigger woman with broad shoulders. But I’m not that big. This is ridiculously tiny. It cut off circulation to my arms and it pulled the Velcro loose because it ended up in the back. I bought another cheaper one and it fit comfortably with the right size adjustments being available. This is for very skinny or very small people.
169. I am always looking for inserts with good arch support to help alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. Usually I am disappointed in the orthotics on the market. However, this insert is wonderful. It has the right balance of firmness and pliability which makes it feel cushiony without being overly soft or overly hard. It also has a high arch that is very supportive for someone like me who has plantar fasciitis.I take at 9 to 9.5 in shoes and sometimes a 10 depending on the cut. Therefore, I ordered this in that woman's size. I use these in my boot-like slippers and I feel like I am walking on air.The current price of $17.84 ($20.99 minus 15%) is competitively priced for an arch support of this quality and support. They are thick, comfortable, and perfect for me. I absolutely adore these.
170. This will pick up a small amount of dirt from a smooth surface. Compared to a regular vac this is not even in the same game and fails miserably in comparison. It is helpful in certain occasions such as when petting your pet and some hair get dropped on the rug and you don't feel like getting out your regular vac.
171. Great bib for a messy eater!
172. I was told that by adding this supplement to my regular regime it would help me with a better absorption of vitamins. Not sure if that’s true or not as I didn’t notice a difference at all.
173. Just what I was looking for to take grout haze off of stone tiles.  Would have taken me days to do it by hand instead of hours with these.
174. no more baggy in your pocket, love that they stack easily for space saving, open easy and nice pictures on them.
175. I purchased these to clean black marks off a brand new kitchen counter at my office. The counter became scratched up from tin foil catering trays and general use and regular soap wasn't doing the job. With a little arm power, I was able to get off most of the black marks using the magic eraser :)
176. This thing saves a bunch of time and mess. And they know it cause they charge a premium $$$. Its probably 30cents of plastic. You could easily make at home if you had the right toolsskills. Also had to drill the hole out cause its extremely difficult to push caulking out as is. But it did make the job way easier. Just wish I didnt have to send them an arm and a leg for their price gouging.
177. Not good at all
178.  I bought these for my sister who is a practicing Wiccan.  She likes to use crystals in her craft, but I thought these would be good for spell jars.  They are presorted into little glass bottles so you don't have to pick through the lot to get to what you need.  The jars are labeled and have a cute little cork as a stopper.  The gems themselves are small enough chips for even tiny spell jars.  They are polished so you don't have to worry about  sharp edges.
179. I like this using this organic peppermint and camphor lotion to massage my shoulders and back! This is my first time trying this product and I'm surprised and satisfied.
180. This has a 5% concentration of potassium nitrate, which is the ingredient used in all sensitive toothpastes to cut down (or, in my case, eliminate) sensitive teeth issues. As such, it works the same as other sensitive toothpastes.It does differ from others with regard to taste and consistency. It has a mild minty taste that, while acceptable, is not all that fresh tasting. The consistency is a bit softer than other toothpastes and it doesn't foam up as much. While that's usually a plus, good foaming action is a benefit when it comes to sensitive toothpastes since it helps the potassium nitrate get into all the nooks and crannies. My favorite sensitive toothpaste is the Colgate foaming action one. It has the same 5% potassium nitrate as this, but the foaming action does make a difference.While the tube looks big, there's not a lot of product. It's only filled about 12 of the way and, while it looks like a standard size tube, it only provides 3.5 oz of toothpaste. It's also hard to get all of it out of the tube since the tube is plastic and does not roll up. It dispenses fine when mostly full, but is not great at dispensing when the level gets low.While this does work, the negatives put my score at 3 stars (average). Not a compelling purchase compared with other options.
181. Havent really noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I have been using it once a day. It is a very fine powder.
182. Vitamin D3 is one of several supplements which if I take in pill or table form upsets my stomach, so as with those other supplements am happy to try this D3 in gummy form.  These gummies are really good!  Their fruity flavor tastes great, they dissolve easily, do not upset my stomach, and are a good dosage.  2 gummies = 2000 IU.  Priced reasonably and made with citrus fruit pectin, this one is worth adding to my daily health regime.
183. This is great Maca!  Super digestion as it is gelatinized and I noticed significant improvements in hormonal values and energy within a couple of days.  I've also added this to my wife's smoothie protocol as well and her fibromyalgia has significantly reduced.  Quite accidentally, I ended up leaving the stuff behind when taking a trip and within a couple of days all of the effects started to disappear.  Got right back on it when I got home.On the flip side, I purchased this stuff at $21  just 3 months ago and now its over $31.  Not happy about that.  However, I do note that they give you discounts on shipping if you order more than one, so there's that.
184. We do a lot of day trips. With a little one that spits up quite a bit, it’s great to have a small portable stain fighting spray for those not so small stains you don’t want to set in! No more worry about “stained” clothes because you couldn’t wash it right away! Travel stain fighter FTW!
185. Great price, taste good and good packaging! Can not speak on benefits, just received! But I have been talking pollen for a while and it’s good stuff.
186. These KAIRNE Reusable Cotton Rounds are great for removing makeup. I have used them twice and they are easy to use. I have not used the enclosed bag to wash them yet.The rounds come in an adorable container for storing your pads. The container comes with two tops one is sort of like a stopper and the other covers it. The pads could be used with a cleanser to wash your face also. I just toss the used pads in the enclosed laundry bag for washing later.I will be recommending these KAIRNE Reusable Cotton Rounds to family and friends.
187. I gave this NAC 5 stars because it’s easy to swallow, it doesn’t upset my stomach and it’s the 1st NAC I’ve taken that doesn’t smell like stinky rotten eggs upon opening the bottle every day. There still is a subtle smell but totally bearable.
188. I was informed that DGL Licorice would be helpful for acid reflux.  It did not work for me.
189. Good Product
190. At some points I enjoyed this but using it as hoped to sit behind my head while I’m driving or safely parked during lunch. The strap didn’t hold up the unit in place like o wanted to and this soon dropped too low to stay up from the elastic band wearing down too fast and not way to tighten it down
191. Great way to be safe while still enjoying a night out.This Breath Alcohol Tester is a highly portable Breathalyzer that you can take easily take it wherever you want. Keep one in your purse or jacket and you can test yourself or others before driving. Or, keep one in your car glovebox !The tester features an awesome LCD display where you can read the values of the test result quickly and accurately. Very useful this time of year. Gives you the peace of mind about whether or not you should be driving. Uses standard AAA batteries.ProsLight and easy to carry aroundHas accurate resultsGood for self-checking and analysisHighly sensitive and pretty good qualityCons:I have none at this time, but I am sure there are more expensive or better ones out there with more bells & whistles.
192. Another great deal from BS. Great glucosamine powder, great price!
193.  I have to take gummy supplements due to pills irritating my stomach. These taste like prunes, smell like sweet mushrooms so the flavor is offputting but not bad.
194. Ordered on Thursday received this morning. Screwed right on! Perfect fit. Very soft love it!
195. Only one thought - not enough variation on design colors, used as decorator items.  Great product none better.
196. Every beard is different and I wish I had one like Chris Stapleton but unfortunately I don't. I like the Groomed and Tailored Beard Set but my beard is not quite there yet. I love the quality of the items and especially like the scissors. The three tools come in a cloth bag.
197. This is a great cleaner for getting stickers and what not off of flat or slightly curved surfaces.  The included razor scraper makes very quick work or any stubborn stickers.  We used it to remove registration stickers in the cars, and to remove some old vinyl clings from some windows.  Scraper holds the blades firmly and prevents slips and accidental cuts.
198. It doesn’t not blink in any way that is described in the listing. Absolute waste of money.
199. Ginseng has delivered several beneficial results. Morning sickness? Pickled ginseng from the grocery refrigerated section and supplements keep it at bay. Monotonous low energy? Ginseng.Ginsenosides are a natural steroid group exclusive to the Panax genus of ginseng. It acts as an anti-inflammatory. 2-3% concentrations are natural in Panax. 10% would be a 3x concentration.Always reliable. Nice value. Seems like a quality source.
200. I have been using this for a hot minute. 1 Tablespoon on an empty stomach will get your there quick. Remember that kava is fat soluble so take it with almond or coconut milk. Not a bad bang for your buck.
201. The smell does not last for more than 30 minutes.I bought it for my New Zealand wool dryer balls.I think it is rather expensive for its poor quality.But the smell is nice.
202. Make sure you want this as it is not returnable even though it says it is when you order it
203. Works great next to our kitty litter box! Quiet and efficient. Highly recommend!
204. If you want something healthy this is it..I use the super Chlorella Powder when I make a smoothy in my vitamix.The taste of Chlorella is not the best to just drink it alone. I add organic frozen cherrys, part of a Apple, carrot, celery, bananaEven cabbage, and ice.I’m not a coffee drinker, but this drink gets me going in the morning, or a fast drink during the day.I really cannot find anything I do not like about this Chlorella powder..it’s organic, high in A& B-12,  cracked cells-easier to absorb,No wheat-no Gluten.
205. I have been wanting to check my pH levels as I have been having stomach issues, so when this item was made available to me for a reduced price for my honest opinion and review, I jumped on it.  The first day I tested my saliva along with my urine and both tested the same, around 5.5 which means my system is acidic. A range of pH 6.5-7.5 is perfect.  pH below 6.5 is to acidic and a level above 7.5 is to alkaline.. The pH of a person is very informative as to what is going on inside your body. If your pH is to acidic you can experience fatigue, headaches, and many other symptoms.  If you system is to alkaline, that can cause joint pain, nerve pain, insomnia and other issues.  By daily monitoring your pH levels you can get your range in the perfect spot by adjusting your diet.  I just checked  my levels for today and I am now in that sweet spot.  These test strips work great, they come with a pH chart on the label and a printed copy with directions. This is fast and easy to use,you get results in 15 seconds, this bottle contains 200 strips.  Thank you to Healthy Wiser for allowing me to try their product!
206. This Disney bag is soooo cute.
207. My lips have never been in such a good condition. No more lines and peeling. I just can't say enough about this product. It's like silk on your lips! But, most of all it works!!!!
208. Ive been looking for an organic dandelion and milk thistle supplement and there were no many choices that have both in them. I am sensitive  to alot of things whether it be supplements or food. I have not had any adverse reactions to these but I do not take take them everyday. I have a peace of mind to know I am taking a supplement without some type of pesticide or chemical used.
209. This is the worst tooth floss I have ever used.  You will be able to clean between two teeth before it breaks ........Even if you double it up it still breaks. Very very thin.  It would be good for hanging Christmas decorations.  It would be impossible to floss your whole mouth with one strand without it breaking.
210. Impressed that it actually works and relieves my pain.
211. I use this to make a Muesli for breakfast. I like that it's organic.
212. The plastic seal was broken. Also, the twist seal on the lid was damaged not on the grooves of the bottle completely, so when I twisted to open it the entire thing came off. This seems to be what caused the oil to leak out in the packaging, about 15 of the bottle. It smelled strongly of lime when I opened the box, so I knew immediately it had leaked. Regarding the scent, it is refreshing and a pleasant lime smell. I would have given this 5 stars if it wouldn't have leaked.
213. Bought these for my son who loves them.
214. Best powder ever!  No longer getting a rash under my chest.  Will always purchase and use especially in hot weather.
215. This has everything and is very organized.The antibiotic oinment is NeomycinThe non asprin is tylenolThe anti bacterial wipes are Benzalkonium ChlorideThis zips up easily and keeps everything organized in its sections. It has everything you could need. I highly recommend this kit to have on hand and one for traveling.* Alcohol Prep Pads* Antiseptic Towlettes* Instant Cold Compress* Tweezers* Safety Pins* Antibiotic Ointment* Burn Cream Ointment* Non-aspirin Tablets*Aspirin Tablets* Sting Relief Pads* Cotton Tip Applicators* Finger Splints* FIRST AID INSTRUCTIONS* Adhesive Bandages (1in x 3in)* Adhesive Bandages (38 in x 1.5 in)* Adhesive Bandages (34 in x 3 in)* Butterfly Closures* Paper Tape Roll (1.5 in x 2.5 yds)* Sterile Gauze Pads (2 in x 2 in)* Sterile Gauze Pads (4 in x 4 in)* Sterile Trauma Pads (5 in x 9 in)* Examination GlovesI received this product at a discount in exchange for feedback and an honest review
216. My son is a doodler and this was perfect for him.
217. I wasn't sure what to expect with this as I usually take pills for my B12.  The taste is good.  My only real complaint is a dropperful is supposed to be 1mL, but I have yet to be able to get the full 1mL in the dropper.  The most I can get it to go is to .75mL.
218. It's fine, closes securely and doesn't pop open like I feared (and I leave it in my bag while I haul it all over campus, books and laptop hitting it).I initially worried about the pills mixing into each other because it doesn't look like the divider reaches to top of the case, but it wasn't a problem for me. I have fairly small pills but if yours are particularly small I'd do a shake test on it.Unintuitive to clean, it's hard to get into all the corners, but that's inherent in this type of case. I just didn't think about that before I bought it.Black case isn't fully opaque like you'd think it would be, and the + sign is mostly transparent. If you want to hide the contents, not the case for you.
219. After not finding a cure for waking up every night at 3AM (not 2:59, or 3:01) and finding that Ambien was actually not suited for me I sought the help of an alternative medical doctor (has all the sheepskin of an official practitioner but leans heavily on homeopathic and 'new age' medicine I HIGHLY recommend this type of medicine esp if you are menopausal and your Doc wants to prescribe synthetic meds)He told me to google the Chinese Medicine wheel and at or around 3AM I would find whatmy ailment was.  It was an issue with my liver.  He had me use Hepa Trope, take one twice a day.  After 2 days of Hepa Trope I slept through the night.  No ambien hangover or eyes popping open at 3AM.  I am on my 2nd bottle and still take it almost everyday.He sells this in his office, but he is 45 minutes from me, plus the Amazon price is a bit friendlier and arrives in a couple of days.
220. I use 6 diffusers, throughout, our home, daily, and I spend a small fortune on Essential Oils. I have used the same company for years and I never thought I could be swayed to like oils from any other company until I tried the oils in Salty Essential Oils. I tried the Lemon in my hall bathroom because it was a smaller space and I wanted to see if I could smell the oil  It was fantastic!! I tried this same experiment with the Frankincense and Bergamot. Fabulous!! The scents last after the diffuser has run out. As I write this, I have been enjoying Orange in my living room. I love that each oil has an explanation of what it can be used for...example, sleep, headache, etc. What an unexpected pleasure this product has brought to me. I am so glad I ordered it!!
221. Arrived on time. Easy to use. Accurate. A great product. I'm ordering these again.
222. Is what was suspected
223. This works incredibly well for smelly shoes if you follow the directions. I washed my boots and they started smelling a couple days later so I tried this for several days and it worked!  I was skeptical because this is not a chemical product but it works really really well  and smells great.  I also love that it doesn’t leave any powder residue in the shoes like other products on the market
224. Comfortable, easy to use, provides support
225. It does what is suppose to.
226. I like that I can wear this tens unit even when I'm out shopping.  The main machine fits in my pocket easily.Setting it up is easy.  Just need to take the time to find the best mode and intensity to suit your needs.Some areas I can do stronger intensity while other areas a lighter tough is needed.This has so many modes to choose from.  I, personally, love the deep tissue.  Works great and feels so good on my back when I pull a certain muscle.Gives enough pads to last awhile.ONe of the better tens unit I've tried.
227. Works amazing on my Pandora jewelry but the cleaner does smell like eggs. As long as u rinse off the jewelry after using the cleaner, the smell goes away and they look amazing
228. did nothing ....
229. My favorite thing about this is the button that you push to pop open the lid.  It's well made so should be durable.
230. Highly recommended!
231. Overall I am impressed with the effectiveness of these s they are intended. Silky waterproof like material on one side, and soft fleecy material on the other. They are meant for "low flow"-- which I am really only most comfortable with using it for very light days, so please keep that in mind. I always wear a liner for various reasons. I am using these for that purpose. They do not leak, there is no odor that I have notices, and the material is so soft and comfortable. My lady bits like the fleecy feel. When done I toss it in the wash or hand wash depending on what I feel like.While the liners stayed put in a manner that kept me covered,  do notice some shifting. I am larger in size, so underwear is larger.. and it seems that these were quite loose. I think a second button snap right along the first to make more narrow, andor a second set to also help keep it in place. Right now it is one snap, loose fit. It may not be limited to these, this may be the norm? This is my first experience with reusable cloths. I really like the idea, and while I am not ready to fully swap out, I can comfortable using these in place of my daily liner. Or paired with a resuable menstrual cup. But for flow? I am not there yet in terms of confidence.
232. Overall, this is a pretty decent mop and bucket set.  The mop is excellent. The pole is metal, and the sections thread together well. The threaded portion is recessed into each section, making for a very durable, solid connection that won't come apart or loosen when using the mop. The mop head is not threaded, but it has a good quality snap button attachment.  The only mop-related complaint I have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic. It's a decent quality, thick plastic, but metal would have been nice since that's a strain point on the mop.The mop head covers are of good quality, and attach well with Velcro to the mop head. Two pads are provided in the set. While they can be machine washed, it's better to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat. It reduces the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machine.The bucket design could have been better. It is smaller than another similar product that I have which is actually a positive, since it weighs less when full of water. However, it lacks some key convenience features, such as a pop-open drain at the base. It is also not possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use. The overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat lightweight, especially the handle. It lacks the heft and durability of other similar products.While the bucket issues brings my score to 4 stars, this is still a very good performing set. It's easy to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a spring that allows it to automatically fold vertically so it can be inserted into the bucket. The "squeegee" on the dry side does a good job of wringing out the water. The ability to have a wet and a dry side to the bucket makes mopping quicker, easier, and results in a better job.Not perfect, but a decent value for the price.
233. Holds a lot of stuff in our small RV very well made too!!! Only thing is our headrest is one piece and it is a tight connect.
234. These aren't returnable so think carefully before you choose to buy them. I bought them to replace an old Ace Bandage but they are so short, slippery, and weak -  I went back to using the old Ace Bandage.  I think I will donate these and then go buy another bandage.  Waste of time and money
235. I ordered this by mail when I was away from home to be sure it would be waiting for me when I returned.  These vitamins are recommended by health care professionals for women.
236. Posture Corrector for Men and Women, Adjustable Upper Back Brace with Clavicle Support,Pain Relief from Neck and Shoulder,Breathable Body Straightener FDA ApprovedA little bit difficult to get on at first but it is effective and it does work!
237. Wore this on flights in January when flu season was rampant. Finally stayed well —no flu or URI. First time flying without getting sick in three years
238. When toilet paper became so scarce at the beginning of the pandemic, I ordered a bidet sprayer (https:www.amazon.comgpproductB01E4H7DTA) to cut down on TP use. Then all I had to worry about was using just enough TP to dry off. Then I got these washable bamboo makeup removers that fit nicely in a little ceramic pot on the back of my toilet, and they work great for drying off. Not only that, when used with a low-sudsing feminine wash, I can wash my private parts as needed and cut down on how often I waste water bathing.For someone who is retired with little activity and very dry skin, there really is no need to bathe more than once a week as long as the privates are washed daily. I like that I can do this while sitting on the toilet and not risk a fall (I have osteoporosis) getting in and out of the tub. Besides, I hear a number of celebrities are now advocating not bathing very frequently, so I must be cool!I got two packs of 16 makeup removers each, and each pack comes with a nice mesh bag for washing the rounds in the washing machine. So I keep a bag beside the toilet to hold the ones I've used, and when the clean ones are all gone, I just start on the second pack while the other is in the wash. The little bit of soap left on each used round prevents it from getting groady until wash time.I'm very, very pleased with this product, and I'd give it an extra star if I could for the washing bag.
239. We do not use anything else. Nothing compares. Love it, just a bit more expensive but worth it. Hair doesn't get sticky. Goes on light.  I do wish there was no odor. Daughter freaks out about breathing it in. Tell her it is good stuff but she doesn't like it, so sometimes I am chasing that head around.
240. I'm an adult and I use baby lotion (as recommended by my doctor) for myself because of how incredibly sensitive and incredibly dry my skin is. In my quest to find a lotion that does not make my skin hurt.... this almost worked? My skin reacted to it minimally but this stuff isn't hydrating at all! When you put it on, it feels pretty good! But a half-hour later my skin feels just as dry as before! I do however use the Sweet Apple body wash and that has been a game-changer! Best body wash I've ever used! But the lotion is a miss for me
241. Motif Medical: Motif TwistThe twist is a small, lightweight very portable breast pump. It comes with a 24mm one piece breast flange with a comfort cushion. It can be battery operated with four AA batteries. It is rather cute in appearance to me and it comes with a one year warranty. Replacement parts can be hard to get if one is attempting to order direct however aeroflowbreastpumps.com carries Motif Medical replacement parts. The pump comes with no accessories. If you need a tote and cooler you’ll have to purchase your own. Warranty on the pump is one year from date of purchase or received through insurance.What’s included…♦ 4 Valves and membranes,♦ 2 Wide neck bottles (ML volume only) with nipples and hard plastic sealing disc♦ 2 One piece flanges with comfort cushions & caps (Flanges included is the standard 24mm only)♦ 1 AC Power Adapter♦ 2 Sets of tubingPROS…♦ Twist is a closed pump, meaning there is a barrier usually a diaphragm that prevents milk and condensation from entering the tubing♦ Small and lightweight which makes for high portability. It’s far lighter than my Avent double electric comfort pump and that too is far lighter than other double electric pumps.♦ Parts is interchangeable with the Motif Curve♦ Flanges is rather light in comparison to other full one piece bodies♦ Comfort cushion makes for one of the most comfortable pumping experiences♦ Twist has two phase expression. When the pump is turned on it starts in the let-down phase where it replicates the faster suckling a baby would do to get milk flowing. Turning the dial up enters the expression phase. When expressing I noted that higher suction has a longer pull on the nipple.♦ With some hacks flangesflange bodies can be used from other closed pumps♦ Other bottles than can be pumped into is Avent classicnatural and Dr. Browns wide neck bottle (This is only if using motif flanges)♦ Twist is a double electric pump allowing mom to express from both breast at the same timeCONS…♦ Pump is loud. It’s comparable to Avent Double Electric Comfort Pump in terms of loudness.♦ Motif only carries a 24mm flange and a 28mm flange.♦ Parts is hard to get. At this time what I noted is only Aeroflowbreastpumps.com carrying all of Motif replacement parts.♦ One must use Motif brand valves and membranes or duckbill valves. The flange opening where the valve would go is far smaller than Medela so trying to use Medela valvemembranes or third party ones from Nene SupplyMayomom will not work with the Motif Twist flanges.♦ Tubing is double ended which forces a lactating mom to use Motif parts. ( I did a hack and cut one of the ends off allowing for me to use flangeflange bodies from other companies. I also noted that the tubing is rather soft and has some stretch to it, allowing for me to remove the excess plastic from the end for use with Spectra tubing. Thus far I was able to use my Avent comfort flanges and my Medela personal fit connectors with Pumpin’Pals flanges with the Motif Twist. &#60; Most commercial, single user breast pumps use vacuum technology so flanges can be used interchangeably between brands.&#62;)♦ ( This is a personal con which may not be across the board for all moms.) Vaccum sucks the nipple and areola in well and creates good suction. I noted this phenomenon between three different company flanges where removing the flange from the breast is a bit of a task and has sort of a pop like noise from the release. I don’t have this feeling when using electric breast pumps from other companies.♦ Motif Medical only has Monday through Friday customer service from 8am-5pm EST.Update 172018I called Motif’s customer service asking about replacement parts and a larger flange size. Please understand that cutting the tubing to use different company flanges can and will void out your warranty. Parts is covered for 3m and motor is one year according to the warranty. I was informed that a 32mm flange is in the works and should be available soon this year. I was sent two 28mm flanges and extra valvemembranes. Although I have been using size 30mm flanges for most of my pumping career, I recently changed out to size 28mm to note that I am able to express well with the size. 30mm may be more comfortable for me to use with no chances of my nipple hitting the back of the flanges.Motif has an interesting flange for size 28mm. The body and flange is separate from each other. The diaphragms, I noted is bigger than what is included with the 24mm flange. It’s a small pot and is far deeper than the 24mm ones. 24mm Flange has a shallow pot diaphragm.  The flange is also shaped like a pot. It covers all of my areola and is quite comfortable. It’s far more comfortable than Medela in my opinion. I also decided to change valves from the two piece valvemembrane thing most companies put out. I switched to a third party duckbill valve from NeneSupply also sold on Amazon and noted that it fits onto the flanges and work well. The valvemembrane combination doesn’t offer good suction thus I need a higher vacuum to express with. Maymom another third party after market retailer also sold on Amazon carries a thread changer which also works well with Motif flanges. With the thread changer I was able to express into Medela and Ameda narrow neck bottles just fine. The thread changer only works properly with duckbill valves that aren’t Avent. ( Avent style valves one cannot express with using the thread. ) Thread also works well with the two piece valvemembrane combination.Overall, I would recommend the Twist. It’s a high quality pump and I personally respond to it well. Flanges are quite comfortable to use and the pump is extremely light weight. The pump is rather loud but it’s no louder than other pumps close to its size. Replacement parts may be hard to obtain but Aeroflow carries them as well as a call to customer service one can get them. Third party duckbill valves work with motif flanges and the 28mm flanges is easy to clean.Update 372018I recently went looking for replacement parts only to note that 1. Motif updated their website to include a parts store 2. The 28mm flange was updated. 32 is still not available, neither is a full flange size 21mm or 19mm. Currently the insert for the 24mm flange reduces the flange down to a 21mm. There is an insert for the 28mm flange however I was informed via customer service that it's only for added comfort and it doesn't change the flange size.The 28mm flange is now a single, one piece body, with a shallow pot diaphragm. It was changed as I was told the old version was more expensive to produce than the current model. The new 28mm flange has a very similar appearance to the 24mm flange included with the pump. I have yet to receive and use the new model but I shall soon and update this review again.Update 3272018I recently called Motif customer service. As my pump is still under warranty for parts I inquired about the 28mm flanges. I was sent another set of flanges though with shipping one of my flanges arrived broken.  It's no big deal as the original set I was sent is still functioning just fine. Motif has not changed their 28mm flanges. It's still a two piece item with a larger pot diaphragm.  The parts store shows a replacement diaphragm being the same size as it is for the 24mm flange. From what I am seeing via photos and what originally came with my pump the 24mm flange body has a  shallower pot for the diaphragm. Parts store claims the flanges both 24mm and 28mm use the same size diaphragm but such is not the case as one is far bigger than the other. There is still no other flange size out side of 24mm and 28mm. 28mm Flange now has an insert I have not used nor ordered as the flange is very comfortable to use.Still I would recommend the pump for mamas who use the available flange sizes. It's still a high quality pump and I believe it performs far better than my Spectra s2 and my Medela pisa ( pump in style advance.) Customer service is good and Motif makes quality breast pumps.Update 09122018I recently noted that Motif Medical has taken to offering their replacement parts and flanges on Amazon. We can not order breast flange kits with valvesmembranes and tubing included. Breast flange inserts, replacement valvesmembranes, diaphragms, extra flanges and so on is now sold on here making it convenient to get parts.My pump now being 8m old is currently in the process of being replaced. After doing routine maintenance of replacing tubing, duckbills ( I don't respond well to the valvemembrane combo so I don't use them ) and diaphragms monthly, I noted that my pump is no longer able to provide me with adequate suction even when increasing the suction on the pump. With daily use of three plus times a day it is past it's prime. As with other pumps I've replaced in the past, the old motor will be sent back in exchange for  the new motor. I never used the pump as a double as for me I noted that it doesn't perform well as such. I always used my pump as a single and on AC power, never battery. Using any pump as a double kills the vacuum strength thus motor is worked harder and mom would need to use higher suction overall. I would still recommend this pump for moms on the go now that parts is easier to get and the fact the pump is reasonably priced even when it's on sale.
242. Shipping was incredibly fast and I actually received three. Thank goodness because one broke as I was learning to use it and the other got deformed when I finally got it in. It makes a gorgeous bun, but the product is not sturdy enough for multiple uses.
243. I needed a new shaker bottle and decided to give this one a try.  I've used this for a few days now and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  It's leakproof, which is good considering I throw it in my gym bag.  The blender ball works just as well as any other blender ball out there.  I really like the non-slip grip that they put on the sides (finger grove area) and the bottom of the bottle.  It really helps with not dropping the bottle when there is condensation all over it.  My only wish is that there was a ring or a loop or something on the bottle to make it a little easier to hold.
244. Works fine, and the price is good. I'd buy this again!
245. This stuff tastes great and helps me thru my workouts...
246. Beautiful color and big flakes! I love this product. If I ever run out, I will buy more without hesitation!
247. This is a beautiful copper magnetic bracelet. I've only worn it for a day and havent had any pain in my fingers like I do at times. I'll update as I notice anything. I received a discount for an honest review.
248. Love the packaging for travel. Since a little goes a long way, you will probably get more from this pouch than you think.Easy to dispense. Doesn’t irritate my dry  sensitive skin. Has a slight scent that fades quickly + didn’t trigger any migraines (always a win from something with fragrance).The lotion itself is nice. Easy to blend into the skin. Makes my skin feel pretty nice. The best part though, is definitely the packaging. Besides being travel  storage space friendly, you don’t have to put your fingers into a jar and so you’re not contaminating the rest of the lotion every time you use it.
249. I have purchased quite a few different supplements and had some free sample sizes from Bulk Supplements over the last few years. Horsetail is a herb I have heard about but never thought seriously adding it to my regimen until recently. Listening to a video on alternative dentistry, horsetail is the go-to herb for healthy teeth and gums. I ordered the herb from Bulk Supplements and began to take 1teaspoon a day. The color of the powder is brown and the taste tolerable. I was concerned about the quality and freshness though. After taking it for 2 weeks I couldn't tell one way or the other if it was having any effect at all. In the meantime I decided to order the same herb through another well known company that only sells fresh dried herbs, oils, etc organically grow, and American made. It arrived today. This new one is like night and day. It is green and smells earthyfresh. It is still just tolerable to taste, but that is pretty typical with herbs. I chuck it back with just enough water to get it down then chase with at least a cup of purified water. So, sorry, B.S. But your product just doesn't pass the quality test with this particular herb. I wouldn't recommend it and I plan on purchasing other herbs from the other company because I know it is high quality.
250. This is like putting white out on your teeth . Don’t waste your money !
251. Update - 01062021Had to get my hands on the new flavors! tried the sample pack and loved them. Great tasting with the same BUZZ!Original Review:I'm no stranger to caffeine as someone who has always taken pre-workouts and drank energy drinks. I have a pretty high tolerance to the stuff. I'm always on the lookout to try new products and came across this sample pack of NEU's three flavors and figured I'd give it a whirl.The three shots arrived quickly to my door and I waited for the right moment to try the first one. All the flavors were good, but I personally liked the original tropical punch the best (green). I took the first shot before a night out and it worked great! The stuff is smooth and I felt a lift in my mood about 15 mins after taking it. It's nice because the 2oz shot doesn't leave you full of liquid, just crazy good energy. I felt great all night and had zero crash which was exactly what I was looking for.I find that the 300mg of caffeine is the sweet spot for me. It's enough to get me going and not too much where I feel too jittery. This product hits that sweet spot perfectly. It also has other ingredients like B12 and Choline for an additional brain boost. Overall the formula is strong, the product looks amazing and the flavors are great.I would highly recommend trying these out for your next night out on the town, study session, or in the office as a pick me up.
252. I don't like the coconut milk in my coffee or tea, but I use this whenever "light coconut milk" is mentioned in a recipe. This is a good alterative to buying cans of coconut milk, which I use up easily - this 8 oz resealable packet will last me a long time. While the canned milk is undeniably thicker and creamier, adding warm water to this powdered version still yields enough rich coconut flavor to be satisfactory for my Thai dishes. I add a spoonful of red or green curry to a frying pan, add in the prepared light coconut milk, add some ginger, lemongrass, etc.,, and I have a delicious curry sauce. It's also non-GMO and vegan, which is great. I wish I'd known about this product earlier, I would have stopped having to buy cans all the time.
253. I have used this every day for the last 5 months and I love it!  I have a SUV and it still fills the air with the wonderful scent of my essential oils!
254. Very easy to attach to glasses. Very comfortable
255. Quality for a decent price.
256. Great little things for small messes and small hands!
257. These bags were perfect for the job I needed them for.  I have a tin and treats I put in these bags and it worked ut perfectly.  I would buy again. Maybe not sturdy for some jobs, but perfect for this one.
258. I am loving this facial brush! I use it in the shower with face wash and so far, so good! I’m glad I could get rid of using a washcloth. It is made of a soft silicone so not damaging to my skin. It also suctions to the shower wall! I washed it in the dishwashing machine without any issues.
259. These scales are accurate and hold up well with 4 women using them on a daily basis. They are a breeze to move around and super easy to read, even in the dark. They're black and sleek, which adds to their appeal. This was a good purchase.
260. When it comes to winter, sometimes we don't always have access to the vegetables that we want to have.  I love to have juice, but sometimes it just is not possible to get fresh vegetables at times.  Having this powder is a great alternative.WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE?This powder comes in a great packaging which seems to keep the powder dry very nicely.  It is cut open and then you can reseal it.  The powder is raw beets, but is freeze dried so you HAVE to keep this closed at all times, before and after you access it.HOW DO I USE IT?I either put this in my vegetable juice that I make fresh and blend it in my hand blender, or if desperate, I add it to cold water and drink it in my mini blender.  I also have used it to make a Keto version of red forest cake which is OUT OF THIS WORLD, by the way.  You just have to add more liquid to counteract the powder.THE BOTTOM LINEFor a great way to get beet juice into your diet when vegetables are not handy, this is an excellent alternative.  The powder is easy to use, tastes fresh and mixes well either in fresh juice or water, or you can use it in recipes too.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I LOVE how versatile it is and between the juice and red forest keto cake, I am most likely going to keep this in my cupboard when I run out- I will buy more.
261. I bought the cleats mainly because it came with the tool, but the tool is too small and not sturdy enough to remove cleats from a golf.  At first, I used pliers to get some torque on the cleat, but it didn't work.  I ended up buying a Softspikes Cleat Kaddy, which was very easy.If you want great cleats, buy this item, but not for the tool.
262. I purchased this replacement bulb for my SLVR410.  This is not the same model as the SLV410.  The bulbs I ordered and received had the plug on the outside of the ring rather than the inside of the ring and were unusable.  That said, I went straight to the manufacturer and they explained the problem to me and sent me the correct bulb for the SLVR410 which is replacement part number FB681.
263. I'm pleased with these Vitamin C gummies. They have a light citrus taste that's very pleasant. The consistency is perfect -- soft enough to easily chew but not something that sticks to my teeth. The gummies are covered with granular sugar which keeps them from sticking to one another even in humid weather.The Vitamin C content is decent, with each serving of 2 gummies providing 240mg. That's not as high as other gummies, but for me, it's a good dosage level. The echinacea content is pretty low at 3.5mg per serving. Still, I use these for the Vitamin C so the echinacea is more like a bonus than something I find essential to have. The price is a little high but not out of range for a 60 count bottle.Overall score of 4.5 stars. I'll round up to 5 since I'm so pleased with the taste and consistency.
264. I got what I needed to wake up and get out to my commute while it's still dark.  I am the poster child for &#34;not a morning person.&#34;  This makes it happen.
265. I have to be careful with these or they give me a terrific headache. Be careful of taking with anything else.
266. I purchased this case to protect my oils for an upcoming move overseas. I love the print that I chose and the extras that came with it. It seems to be a pretty sturdy case. Holds all of my oils perfectly. The 5mL bottles are a tad bit loose in the slots but that’s not a problem right now. The 15mL bottles fit very snug which is perfect. I will try to remember to update after my flight to let you guys know whether the case protected the oils or not.
267. I like that these are soft packaging. Easy to carry in your car, purse, anywhere. Good value.  Why soft on the skin. Would buy again.
268. Did nothing at all for my milk supply.  Stick with straight Fenugreek!
269. Received this for my wife.She's been using it for about a month now and reports that its a good trimmer.  She regularly uses it for legs and armpits and that "other" area.  Good for legarmpits all year round as well as winter maintenance in the "other" area.She does say that you if you have darkthick hair you still need to wax if you're going to the beachpool - but lightfair hair will probably not need to.My electric shaver was out of power and I used it on my face - thankfully it worked.  I see it as revenge, since I know she's been using my electric shaver without my permission...
270. This is an easy and effective way to ice an injured area. I use it on my leg where I was injured and also  it works greats on leg cramps at night. The roller part stays in the freezer for when you need it . You just pop on the roller to the handle and it’s ready to go. It rolls easily and smoothly and then when you are done it cleans up easily. The roller stays icy cold for plenty of time - I have yet to run out of cold while using . The handle fits my hand nice and it it comfortable to hold and use. The roller rolls smooth. This also works great when I have neck pain or a migraine.
271. These were nice enough, but I did notice some cosmetic defects in the surface on 2 of the 3.  Disappointed with that.
272. This is great in my basement bath where we keep an XL litter box for 2 cats. I was impressed. Will be purchasing 2 more units to put in other areas of the basement. Highly recommend.
273. These are fantastic! I take 9 pills a day—three different times of the day. I also have neuropathy in my hands due to past chem infusions. It was difficult to open that many pill bottles throughout the day. These are super easy to open and easy to fill.  I also recently took them on a cruise with me, and they were wonderful and traveled well. I highly recommend these!
274. Awful don't waste your money I purchased this &amp; it didn't last a full year. Everything I did to clean per instructions still will not work. I will never purchase from this company again.
275. Great product. Fast delivery.
276. I’ve gone back to natural nails and needed files for them. I knew the 240 would be okay and was hoping the 180 would work. It does the job but I only use the 180 side for shortening my nails, it’s a bit rough and isn’t at all good for shaping. That being said, the 240 is what I was looking for and it’s easy enough to tell the difference so you don’t use the wrong side.
277. The photos were misleading. It comes with one sheet and it is thick too.
278. Comfortable and as advertised you can still hear everything just that really loud sounds are blocked and reduced in volume. I use them several days a week and have had no problems with them. Recommended.
279. These work great. The are long enough to wash dishes and do other household cleaning. You get 2 pair in different  colors so you won't get the ones for the bathroom mixed up with kitchen gloves. They keep your hands clean and do a wonderful job.
280. The plates are extra tiny and super flimsy. Cups are also very small. The banners are cute, napkins are fine, but overall, the set is pretty disappointing.
281. Easily adjustable, not too tight and changes sizes easily.
282. The only reason this cane holder gets a single star is due to the fact there is no way to assign a Zero star.  The manufacturer and seller should be embarrassed to sell this item due to it's poor construction, lack of instructions and poor design.  Do not purchase this...it's a total waste of money.
283. I purchased these for my dad. Got him two pair.  These really help with circulation of the feet. This company has several other "Sleeve" braces that are very comfortable and help with circulation.My first one was for my knee after surgery. My arthopedic said no BRACES, well these are not braces, but SLEEVES.I originally heard from the people who invented this material that our soldiers in Afghanistan used them to help circulate blood to their feet to help them "feel" warm in the cold desert night.  They could not wear anything that generated real heat because it would make their feet sweat and in the cold air, not good.I was getting foot cramps and these helped my sleep better at night.  I know you are supposed to wear them with your shoes, which I did, but found them more comfortable at night to make my feet feel warm, not hot.I will tell you.. my knee healed faster than expected which was great since I travel for work and need to walk alot.  I noticed my knee didn't get as tired so I got a set for both knees.Then I got the Socks too.  Not just these, but the ones that go above the knee.  Then I got one for the Elbow.  Yeah... I'm that jacked up.I know the quality of these and have recommended to Facebook friends who live across the country. Told them if you don't like them you can return them.  They had similar knee surgery.They had similar experience and also got the socks... Odd... the knee and foot issues seem to go hand in hand, or foot in foot!They to have recommended this brand to their friends.  When I see someone hobbling around.. i ask, then tell them... GOOGLE INCREDIWEAR, read the reviews, then order on Amazon.
284. This is an amazing toothbrush. I have metal in my lower bottom gums with holes to snap into the teeth. I went looking on Amazon and found this amazing product. They keep help get the food out. I will be a couple more because they come from another country and it takes a little longer to get them. So I will buy two more.
285. These delightful brittle - do I call them a candy or a cookie - are different and tasty.  Only problem is I want to eat the whole bag at one time.  I prefer the chocolate chip to the other flavors, but I'm sure that's a preference and not a reflection on the product.
286. Seriously, I love this thing.  I hate washing and fixing my hair because it takes forever as I have very thick wavy hair that holds moisture.  It takes me at least an hour to blow dry (usually still damp at the back of my scalp) and straighten my hair.  I've taken to using dry shampoo for 3 and 4 days to avoid washing and doing the process all over again.  Well, this brush solves all my problems.  The day after I got it I took a shower at night letting my hair air dry a little bit before bed.  When I woke the next morning it was pretty gnarly looking (think Janis Joplin). I sprayed it with my heat protectant and hit it with the blowdryer for roughly 5 minutes just to make sure it was completely dry (that underneath layer was still damp).  I cranked the brush up to 450F while I was blow drying and she was ready by the time I was done.  I brushed my hair thoroughly to make sure there were no knots to snag.  Then the miraculous occurred, I think I heard a heavenly choir singing.  I slowly brushed the first section of my hair.  There was no strange pulling, no scalding piece of hair to hold, no weird kinks against my scalp but it was straight!  Oh wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles!  I did one side and then decided I needed to document this process.  I went and got dressed (must wear a bra for the public good) and grabbed my phone to take a few pictures.  I started with the brush at 7:08 and (with wardrobe changes and selfies) I ended at 7:22.  Say what!?!  This brush is my new best friend.  I didn't get any finger burns from lava hot hair, I even picked out a few stray hairs from the brush while it was on and it didn't burn me (what is this sorcery!).  This brush is amazing and I kind of want to kiss it.  If I never buy another hair appliance again I will be totally ok with that.  I love this thing almost as much as I love my first kindle.
287. I have a 6mo old and a 3yr old, and have one of these germguardian sanitizers in each of their rooms. We hardly every get sick, I would like to think these sanitizers play a part in that. They make just enough noise to act as a noisemaker, as well as put off just enough light to act as a night light (very dim one). They seem to do a decent deal for removing odor (baby diapers) from their rooms.I have had one of these sanitizers in my older kids room for about a year and half and it is still working great. Had to replace the bulb once. I got a really good deal on the ones I bought, on amazon. Most of the time they are overpriced, so wait and you can get a decent deal on these sanitizers. If the price drops again, I will get one for my room.
288. I knew the items included in this package would be small, and they sure were!!  But it is a nice selection of things to try and then I could purchase bigger products of the things I liked the best.  It would make a nice gift also for someone who likes to mess with their nails.
289. I grabbed a pack of water bottles and a gallon of this stuff. I diluted it to 1:1 or 50% in the bottle.Half water half degreaser solution.I got this specifically for degreasing old old old Schwinn Stingray parts.I was gifted a 1965 StingRay my mom found at a garage sale back in 1992.A neighbor spraypainted it all black with magenta wheels and all that junk..Fast forward to 2020 and I'm stripping it down and rebuilding it for my 8 year old niece.Black with flames :).Anyway all the bearings in it needed heavy heavy degreasing. 60 year old bike grease is some of the stickiest nastiest stuff you'll ever encounter. I put the bearing and many other of the quality parts into 100% degreaser after spraying them down with some initial clean up with the diluted solution..The  solution melts grease. IT IS INCREDIBLE..I didn't stop there. I use it everywhere now..On motorcycle parts, car engine bay, and on Grill utensils.You know that Steel brush you use to scrape the grill off after usage?That thing is fulll of grease of course!Soak it in this for a few minutes and rinse it out and it's brand new..Anywhere you can imagine grease existing, this will degrease it..It's phenomenal stuff.A gallon will last me a while but I will DEFINITELY always have this on hand for any dirty greasy job.Cheers
290. Great for travel and to keep things organized at home.
291. Fast shipping and great product.
292. This is one long-lasting unit!  It has taken on some small room issues - VOCs, other odors - and puts out a very, very insignificant green light.  I've used it in powder rooms and, most recently, a college student's bedroom that has accumulated dirty laundry.  Very pleased with this purchase and am about to buy another one.I've tried several negative-ion generators, some with  without fans, some ozone generators, etc., for several years and have found that those with filtersfans tend to die after a few years of constant use, even with filter maintenance.  The fans of these units (not the GermGuardian) tend to finally die.  The smaller ozone generators are wonderful, but I've found that some of the brands are all but impossible to clean and, thusly, lose their effectiveness after a year or so.  (The one of these small units I'm still crazy about isn't being sold by Amazon at this time.  :( )
293. Good detergent. Great value. We purchased it to try to get a stain out of a pocelain sink. It didn't help with that. But, it is a wonderful laundry dey.
294. Same as I was using
295. Great price for two and does the job.
296. My kids love them and, I'm quite sure, well continue to use them into adulthood.  I should  buy stock.
297. I wish this product  was available years ago. This is the most amazing product for mosquito bites. I’m the one that’s bit  in my family I’m always getting bit and scratch like crazy. If you use this right away you too will be  amazed that it worked so well. The itching will be gone. There was still swelling but it did not itch. It’s so simple to use. I actually have the original namebrand one and I prefer this one better because the finger loops make it easier to use. I cannot say enough positive things about this product! The price is excellent , especially since you get three of them. I keep one on my purse and one in the car and another in the first aid kit. This is one purchase you will not regret!!
298. This is not a production unit;  it's a portable, easily transportable, light weight, simple, fairly durable unit.  For a homeowner, handyman or light commercial, it's very nice.  I'm an electrician; for the low end carpentry I need to do my work, this is perfect.
299. Love it ❤❤❤
300. It was a gift so I don’t know details but it was a pretty color.
301. I've done some research on the health benefits of fisetin but can't really find a lot about it.  It hasn't had many studies and the results of the ones done weren't very conclusive.  But, the reason I selected this product for review was not for the fisetin content but the quercetin.  Quercetin is absolutely wonderful at getting zinc into cells to fight off and kill viruses.  It really goes very well with vitamin C, D3 and zinc and I take all of those daily.
302. Great Product!!!
303. I got a free sample of the Dragonfruit flavor. It tastes like how a Band-Aid smells. I can't think of how else to describe it. I didn't realize it was a healthy drink when I popped the can open and just thought it was another brand of LaCroix'esque sparkling waters. After the first foul tasting sip I looked at the can to see exactly what I was drinking. After seeing that it claims to be good for you, I decided to give it another go. I couldn't get past sip number 2. Truly one of the worst tasting beverages I've tasted.
304. Ever since the pandemic began, we have been taking D3 pills religiously. However, not all of them are created equal. These are very good, however, and are easy to swallow, leave no bad aftertaste in your mouth, and are small enough they don't choke the Mrs. Most of all, they are strong enough (5,000iu's) to keep pretty much any nasty germ at bay. Granted, it's not guaranteed to prevent you from catching COVID, but every little bit helps, right? We haven't gotten the virus yet (knock on wood), so we will maintain our regime and take these for as long as it takes to be safe again. Good health to you!
305. I fell several weeks ago and hurt my seat, but, consequently, my legs hurt since then, too.  I bought this to help cushion my seat at work, but it's thick and hurts my legs on the edge.  I have to return the item because it wasn't comfortable for me.
306. Seriously I’m writing a review about ear plugs? They’re that great. I have very sensitive hearing and even moderate noise sometimes makes my eardrums hurt. I always carry one pair of these around with me, keep one in the car, etc. just in case I need them. They’re very comfortable and don’t get irritating. They cancel enough noise that I can feel at ease enough sleep, but if I wear them loosely I could still have a conversation with someone at dinner. They are fairly discrete and the little cases are great, too. I’ve used these for almost a year now whether it’s sitting in a coffee shop or traveling on a plane. If you are in the market for ear plugs, look no further. Seriously these are awesome and so comfy.
307.  I did a bit of research after one of the morning news shows talked about UV lights. This little plug-in was pretty inexpensive, so I ordered it for an area that has puppy pads. It did the job, and was pretty quiet. It's nice to know that the UV bulb is replaceable.I just ordered another one to place in the bathroom.UPDATE: It was pointed out to me that the plug turns, so it can accommodate both sides of an outlet. Thanks to Merry C!
308. Loved the idea off having earplugs attached to a cord for easy access but plug come out and won’t go back in. I can’t really notice a huge noise difference between these and regular ear plugs. My voice and the patients is very muffled. I have to take off my gloves after using the Cavitron to hold a conversation.
309. Just what I needed.
310. It’s an okay ice pack. Gets too hard once in freezer for more than a couple hours. Not my favorite.
311. Fast results that are clear. No dye run issues.
312. I bought this some time ago as an Amazon today deal. This is such a wonderful spray. I could not afford the 29 dollars but it is worth every cent. Here is hoping for another today's deal
313. I really like these lens cleaners. The moisture is perfect. They don’t leave my lenses with streaks. I’ve tried other wipes and they left streaks on my lenses because they were too wet.
314. The lavender smells amazing!  I love the little towel that comes with it.  Great investment for your mat!
315. I have used these several times now. It fully blocks the light while being very conformable.  It worked for me laying down in bed and sitting up on a very early flight. It let me get the best sleep I have ever had on a plane. The soft silk does not add any distraction like other sleep masks I have tried.
316. Like most stain removers, this one works best on "fresh" stains - for example, if you just spilled wine on your blouse five minutes ago. This remover worked but then, so does seltzer if you apply enough of it. When I tried it on an "old" stain (a pair of jeans that had a spot on it from grease), it didn't do anything. The small bottle is handy for travel, however, so it's good for when you're on the go. Overall it's good for mild stains that just happened and you don't have anything else on hand. For more stubborn stains, I'd use something else.
317. Makes nice bubbles and the message is good.
318. But it isn't waterproof, so your medication could melt away if you get caught in rain. It will work and most of us aren't caught in the rain all day everyday, so they can work. You could also put little mouth fresheners or gum in them too. When open, you also have a mirror bright interior lid to look in for fast fix ups.
319. I felt very hard to use and plucks hair
320. Great supply of various popular sizes of watch band pins.
321. The four pack of bamboo bath sponges are a great deal. I go through a few every year and this four-pack will keep me stocked. Soft mesh and shower gel foams up nicely when using. They have a nice ribbon to hook them for draining.
322. Good quality and good price!  Good for adults and children.
323. Does not work. Almost seemed to attract more cats. I would not recommend buying this.
324. I USE IT FOR EVERYTHING, IT'S THE BEST
325. This type of supplement is very good for you and the supplier is awesome. You can curb your appetite have clean skin and have your hair grow very long from using this
326. I am always looking for ways to curb my appetite so I thought I would give these a try. You are to take so many pills each day I think that is hard to remember to take them and with the smell it is hard to force yourself to do. but I was determined to give it a fair shake. I did take them for a week, and I did notice that it helped my appetite. I am not sure if that is because of what is in them, or because of the terrible smell, who wants to eat after you have smelled that? It did work though, so you have to give some stars for that. I defiantly noticed that i was going to the bathroom more often do the detox part worked as well. This is not something I could add or take for my regular routine, but if you are looking for a way to loose a few pounds, or a way to detox for  a week or so, this would work.
327. The first thing I love about this flat iron is that it's cordless!  It's so nice to slowly getting rid of all of the power cords in my bathrooms.The iron itself is nice.  Heats up fast.The only thing I don't like is the size of the heating plate.  I'm used to a longer one in my older flat iron so it's taking me a bit to get used to this one.Since I only straighten my bangs and every so often my entire head of hair, the charge will last me a long time before I need to recharge it again.Nice flat iron that's easy to pack up and take on the go.
328. I love these oil but they raised the price.  This is not greasy and good for skin.  Great for senaitive skin.
329. Pretty rough and started to unravel on second use. Pretty color but that's about it 😣
330. Does not plug in the wall properly
331. I mixed up some of this today with cold water and milk with some ice cubes.  It mixed very well.  I gave my wife a taste, she is pickier than I am on these things.  She liked it.  We both liked it.I appreciate very much that it is MADE IN THE USA.  I really appreciate the grams of fiber along with added vitamins.The only concern I have is the price to re-order when it runs out.  At almost two dollars a serving, it is higher than the others I drink.  But then again, this one has fiber and I don't think any of my other ones do.We like it and will continue to drink it.
332. ridiculous.  1 sheet will not wash anything.  Use 15 sheets maybe
333. I have been using this Clear Care product to clean and disinfect my contacts for years.  It was recommended to me by my eye doctor when I was diagnosed with an eye infection. I have not had an infection in the many years I have been using it. I gave it 4 stars because the double pack only comes with one of the required cases. I think there should be a case for each bottle included.
334. Very deceiving as there was nothing stating that they would poorly paint rubber and glue it to mediocre glass.
335. well packaged, arrived early. great price and smells lovely
336. There are 30 shimmery champagne gold boxes and 6 pages of 20 clear stickers (totaling 120 stickers) that come with this set. They come in one piece and fold into a mid-sized box.I finally figured out how to fold the box bottom correctly. The tabbed flaps go on the outside of the bottom and interlock into the other flaps. They are not very sturdy, so I suspect that 4 of the 120 stickers should be used to secure the 4 tabs as shown in one of my photos.As long as one seals the bottom, it should hold. These are perfect for Christmas gifts (no wrapping needed) or for cookies, cupcakes, or other classy gifts.  Each box should be able to fit about one pound of cookies depending on the size of the cookie or four regular-sized cupcakes. Overall, I think these are classy but I do not like the interlocking design of the bottom that requires stickers to provide hold.The current price of $18.99 for 30 comes to  $.63 cents each which is reasonable
337. When I read this book in the future, back when it hasn't been published yet, it changed my life!  But seriously, I already know I will love this book when it becomes available. Thank you Allie, for Hyperbole and a Half and all things created by your wonderful self. I'm super excited to see the new book. Hope you're doing well.
338. I saw no change with the whitening pen. It does have a pleasant taste. Doesn’t work for me☹️
339. I purchased this toner a few weeks ago. I was looking for something that hydrated my skin. Some toners dry your face out. Not this one! My face felt moist and clean. Dreamy!!!!
340. Great for layout.
341. -The spray nozzle does not spray evenly and leaks huge globs of the oil out on to my mat.-It takes a ton of spraying to even cover your mat so I feel like this is going to last maybe 5-7 uses.-The smell is nice and I like that it comes with a microfiber towel but the towel itself is hideous and too big.Overall, I do not recommend this product.
342. the packaging was different than what is pictured but I really like the fragrance and the way it lathers - I would love to see it packaged in a glass jar - more for the aesthetic look
343. I've been using Cloverine Salve since I was born, well my mom did it for me! 3 generations can't be wrong! 😆 I use it on practically everything except burns until the healing process has started! Get some It's so worth it!
344. They are bgreatbfor the price
345. This is THE chair pad if you sit longer than 10 min. per day especially using a computer. It's well worth the high price for what you get & how it keeps its original shape & form factor over a long period of time.
346. I received Cascade Complete as listed in the product description.  Good product.
347. Rather wobbily.
348. Attachments stopped working g after one use
349. I ordered some generic eyeglass case from Amazon and my Gunnar MLG Phantoms did not fit in them in the slightest.  Didn't even know Gunnar made an accompanying case, but I'm very happy I stumbled upon these.  The quality seems very good; they're made with something like a hard leatherette, so it gives it a nice feel.  Plenty of room inside and I don't feel like my glasses are squished.  I'm considering buying another pair of Gunnars and if I do, I am absolutely buying another one of these with them.
350. This is a good, quality VG for mixing e-liquid.  I've used this in the past, and am quite pleased with it for the price.
351. I like to walk around the neighborhood and pick up trash, and this thing is Great!  I can walk with a bag, and a grabber hand, and easily keep the bag open to put stuff in it.  Then it collapses on itself when you let it drop back down like a briefcase, so trash doesn't blow out.
352. There fine
353. In addition to this new Linea squeegee, I have three OXO shower squeegees two of which are in service at any given time:-  (my favorite)- - I have been using my  OXO squeegees anywhere from twice daily to once every other day depending on which shower I'm using and if I'm taking one or two showers per day.This unit comes in three pieces--the suction cup (which has to be screwed into the stainless steel holder), the stainless steel holder, and the squeegee. Its features are:- Partial crystal-like handle- Rust proof stainless steel in brushed nickel finish for top of squeegee and suction hook- Slightly angled neckPROS- It has a long 10" blade so it's great for wiping down my shower walls in a few passes.- The streamlined design looks sleek and elegant (except for the Lucite-looking handle).- The blade wipes smoothly and leaves my walls and shower doors streak-free.- The suction cup holds hard on my acrylic shower walls.- The blade appears to be replaceable by loosening two screws.- It comes with lifetime limited warranty (guaranteed rust-proof finish, will replace if defective, etc.).CONS- To me this is heavy as it weighs in at 6.5 ounces (excluding suction holder).- The handle looks like Lucite or glass and if the suction cup gives way when it's hanging I expect it to break when it hits the tub or shower bottom. In fact, the weight of this thing might nick the bottom of a porcelain tub. Only time will tell how this holds up.- The handle is too thin for grasping comfortably.- I wish the blade head were a little more angled.Compared to my other squeegees, I actually like this one the least mainly because of the thin fragile handle and the lack of a deeper angled head.If I were to rate my preference in squeegees, my first choice is the  ,  (4.7 stars), and the  . This squeegee  I rate 3 stars because, the handle needs to be thicker and in stainless steel and the head more angled. At the current price of $39.99 plus $5.25 shipping, I feel this is overpriced for its current design.  Nevertheless, this squeegee is a looker and for those who have very large showers and baths, this 10" blade makes short work of wiping away the water.
354. Great task lighting with two slightly different settings. Adjustable for most positions next to a chair. hope the replacement bulb is reasonable when necessary.
355. This Facial Cleansing Brush works great. I love the way the brush feels on my skin. My face feels so clean after using this brush.The box comes with a facial cleanser with three brushes. One brush is made of nylon wool and can be used daily. Another brush is short nylon and can be used daily. The last brush is for sensitive skin. It is made with silica gel and can be used daily. There is also a USB cord for charging and also a user’s manual.I will be recommending this Facial Cleansing Brush to family and friends.
356. This is a company I like to use for essential oils. I get some really nice products at really nice prices. I have tried alot of other companies but this one has some of the best quality oils I have tried in a long time. I am so glad I did it stay with them it was well worth it.This is one of my favorite essential oils I am so glad I found this company.  This lemon oil is a household staple for us and one of my favorite essential oils. I love the smell of this oil it smells like lemon drops. This one is a good choice for my family. I use it to make my homemade body butters and beard waxes. It mixes nice and doesn't separate after it is mixed. It goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin very easily. I like using essential oils regularly and this is a great choice for a carrier oil. Good purchase and a nice big bottle.I purchased this product at a reduced price for an honest and unbiased review.
357. My daughter is a soccer champ in her own right but Megan is her favorite. She loves it. (I do wish they came with a simple stand…)
358. Unfortunately I’m returning this item. I tried it on and it was fairly simple to figure out how to adjust it. It definitely felt like it was pulling my shoulders back and I could instantly feel a bit of relief from my poor posture. However once on and snug, it cuts into my arm pit area too tightly. It may be my size or my sensitivity level. I’m a female, 5 1’ and weigh about 125. I don’t not recommend this product since it seems like it would be effective, it just wasn’t for me.
359. For years I have heard about the Magic Eraser.  From friends and family, even co-workers.  Not sure what took me so long to try it out, but when I did, all I can say is 'WOW'!!!  I had embedded stains from makeup and who knows what on the bathroom corian sink which I scrubbed with baking soda, even softscrub with bleach, and the stains didn't come all the way out.  ONE TRY with the Magic Eraser and BAM!  Stains gone.  Then I decided to try it on the black toaster oven, where I accidentally left a loaf of bread and the plastic melted into the top.  I washed it, rubbed it and used everything I could think of, but that thin layer of plastic wouldn't budge.  In comes the Magic Eraser and it came off right away.  No kidding.  The name says it all, because this stuff is truly magic!
360. It did a nice enough job
361. I love this diaper print! It's so cute otb!
362. I have to have electrolytes when playing tennis. I play very competitively, especially during the summer months when it's very hot here in the Deep South. If I don't have an electrolyte drink available during a match I start getting the shakes and afterwards I am prone to muscle cramping which hurts like you-know-what. I have tasted these electrolyte drops and they taste fine in water, but I haven't been able to test it out on a hot court since it's still winter. But, looking at the ingredients list it seems to have everything I need and more. I especially like the extra potassium it contains.  And I usually have to add a little NaCl to it since I sweat so much of it out while playing but I probably won't have to because it contains 125mg of sodium per serving.  I'm really looking forward to using this electrolyte come this Spring and Summer.
363. If you have dry skin, this is a cool and refreshing healing lotion. It has a light pleasant scent and is not greasy. It includes aloe and vitamin e as ingredients. It is an excellent basic skin lotion to combat dryness. Good for dry hands, dry feet and skin in general. We have a wood-burning stove so the air gets dry in the winter, combined with the cold. Love to apply this lotion throughout the day to my hands and feet to keep them soft. The container works well and squirts easily a small amount of lotion at a time. Glad to find this healing lotion.
364. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this hat, I was not sure if I would as I am generally not a hat person. I have very fare skin however and wanted to see if a hat would work to protect me from the sun this year while working in the garden and this hat is going to be perfect and for an added bonus my hubby actually likes it on me. I think it will also look super cute with a little sun dress to go out ( I am only in my early 30s) so its still fashionable not something for just your grandma but something you can add to your closet for summer days anywhereI received the Vefra Summer Large Brim Straw hat for women for free in order to conduct this review and provide my honest option of this item
365. This floss shredded in my husband’s teeth and he was so disgusted! He had to find Glide floss just to get the strands of this floss out of his teeth! Disappointing.
366. I ordered a small and somehow ended up with either a medium or large. Little big for my taste.
367. Garcinia Cambogia is a small, sour tropical fruit used traditionally as a condiment and to prevent formation and increase release of intestinal gas.  This herb used as natural appetite suppressant. Aids in weight management and does not taste bad.  I mix it in with my yogurt and shakes.  Hopefully it will help me loose weight.  I've taken for 2 days now, 3 doses total, and I already have more energy and notice a suppression in my appetite.
368. I was not expecting the large size of this. This will not fit most rolling papers only extra long ones. I ended up purchasing a smaller (1.25) size that fits most papers. The product was great quality just not what I was looking for. Make sure you are paying attention to the size. It was delivered quickly and as listed.
369. I ordered the 'Dental Duty Teeth Whitening Kit With 14 Non-Slip Whitestrips & Whitening Accelerator Light' for review.  I have had the opportunity to review several other whitening kits recently and this one by far has given my wife the best results.  She has completed six 20-minute sessions and already has had significant results.  Her additional thoughts:• Compared to whitening pens or other trays, these are much easier to use.  You simply open the strips, place the larger strip on your top teeth and the smaller strip on your bottom teeth.  Be sure to get all the way down to your gums and press the strip to adhere closely to your teeth.  Then insert the light into the mouth tray and turn it on.• The light has an automatic shut off at 10 minutes.  Just turn it back on once or twice dependent on the time you want to continue whitening.  I would not recommend nor does the instructions recommend any longer than a half hour.• You do need to open the battery compartment to remove the paper between the two batteries to use it.• The photos show her before pic along with after the first use and then after 6 uses.  The pictures were taken in the same spot in the house at the same time of day without a flash.• Because these are strips versus a gel, you do not have anything draining into your mouth while you are whitening.  Once you turn off the light and remove the tray there is some saliva mixed with white foam.  She did not gag as much as with the gels.• It may be too early to tell but, at this point this product has not caused any additional sensitivity to her teeth.• This kit is less expensive then many other less comparable whitening kits.Overall, my wife is happy with the results she has seen already.  She is looking forward to finishing a complete week. Once she does I will update my review with new after pictures.
370. Okay the flavor on this one is intense.  It’s strong enough that I find I don’t want to chew it very long.  To me that’s much better than the usual weak flavor, but is something to consider if you don’t like a strong flavor.  The flavor sticks around awhile.The packaging is recyclable (I use them for storing small craft items in).
371. I have seen others use these and they seem quite happy with them. So I needed one because I am so uncomfortable on planes. I am looking forward to using this. When you take a plane for over just a few hours, you really would like to sleep. This should help me. Especially since it also has an eye mask and noise plugs.
372. This is the second time I have bought bath booms. The first time was Lush, which was great but expensive. So, I decided to try another one. Then I found Ikalula! I like Ikalula’ bath booms! They have sweety smells and different colors! I love “Sweet Orange” most! I love all orange and lemon smells! They make my skin soft and make me relax after I bath. I will buy it again!
373.  They hair dryer came securely packaged it can with a cute velvet travel size bag, It is a digital blow dryer so you can control the temperature on the dryer.this hair dryer is lightweight, it’s like I’m not holding anything when I use the dryer to blow out my wigs. the color of the dryer had my attention.It comes with two attachment a smooth nozzle and diffuser, the power of the blow dryer drys in no time. I definitely recommend this seller
374. Tried it on a window and a wreath and it is a yucky mess!  Never dried.  Stayed wet.
375. I received this product and promptly put it in the refrigerator for twenty four hours or so. I took one out noticing the easy open label on the top. It actually was. The plastic covering peels off with minimal effort and I think just about anyone will be able to twist the top off. . . Unfortunately. I've drank some bad things before. I've even had spoiled beer that had unidentifiable chunks floating in it. This was that bad. It was revolting. Chalky and bitter with a horrible chemical, sour, twang. I had two mouthfuls and I was still tasting this hours later. Yes, I ate and drank other things to try and get rid of the taste but it lingered. Hands down this was the most revolting thing I have ever drank. Tossed the other five bottles in the trash. I do not recommend this product. Unless you don't like someone, a lot.
376. Use this product for long runs. It’s great!
377. Brew it with hot water, it helps with lung cleaning.
378. I've enjoyed the premade version so reading the powdered version wasn't the same didn't surprise me. But a lot of reviews claim it tastes terrible and was so different they threw it away. Luckily, I trusted the company and tried this product anyway. Contrary to those low-star reviews, I disagree that it doesn't taste similar, and when mixed in a blender you almost can't tell the difference. I use a small portable version.  Just using a shaker cup doesn't blend it as successfully but ok if you just need that satisfying shake to stave off snack cravings. I find this meal replacement to be very satisfying and helps stop me from craving excess food. I do 2 scoops to actually replace a meal, 1 scoop to stave off snacking (note: the container says 12 c is for 8oz & 23 c (2 scoops) is for 12 oz). Not as creamy as the premade but probably not as many additives, either. Unfortunately, I've realized this product causes stomach discomfort so I can't enjoy it as often as I would like. If you pop and enzyme pill and a probiotic pill just before, it helps a lot with the gas.
379. A month ago my blood pressure was 14080. I had atrial flutter issues and my heart was acting bizarre. I started taking a Potassium and Magnesium product and saw some results. Then I read The Magnesium Miracle by Dr. Carolyn Dean and stated taking this liquid magnesium. I noticed good results with magnesium and now my blood pressure went down to 11060. So my nurse practitioner has halved my blood pressure medication and I have an appointment in a month to check it again.If you do take this liquid magnesium and have high blood pressure make sure you are working with your doctor or nurse because your medication may need to be adjusted. They also did an EKG on me and said my heart was normal and I told them: "Well I'm taking magnesium." They also did blood tests and said they were normal. I'm not sure my nurse actually realized that the magnesium had lowered my blood pressure. Here are some of my experiences day by day at the start:Day 1: I took 14 teaspoon in 16.9 fluid ounces water. It made me feel relaxed and I slept well.Day 2: I got ambitious and took 12 teaspoon in a large container of iced tea and it only tasted a bit salty.Sipped over a couple of hours and it seemed to relax me and take the edge off my anxiety. I thought it was giving me a lot of energy and made my heart beats really strong.Day 3: Backed off a bit and took 14 teaspoon in a small amount of cranberry juice. Tasted salty and a bit bitter so didn't want to do that again. Decided it needed more liquid to make it palatable.Day 4: Took 14 teaspoon in a pint (2 cups) of coconut water. My anxious thoughts stopped and my mind felt calm and almost as if my thoughts were not as loud.Day 5: Took 14 teaspoon in 2 cups bottled water. Felt as if my system was detoxing and cleaning out.Day 6: Felt like toxins were being released so drank more water.Day 7: Decided to try taking the magnesium liquid in capsules. That way you can't taste and salty or bitter flavor.Day 8: While waiting to get capsules, took 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in iced tea.Day 9: Put 14 teaspoon magnesium in 3 veggie capsules. Swallowed them down with no issues.Since then I've been taking 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in five veggie capsules. I fill them up with a syringe and take them right away, not letting them sit around to dissolve. It is a little extra effort but it keeps my atrial flutter under control and I feel better in general. You may want to wipe the capsules off a bit after filling. I just use a napkin. That way you don't taste any of the liquid. That is my best solution and how I'm going to continue to take this magnesium.My cautions are to start slow with drops or 14 teaspoon and work up slowly to 12 teaspoon a day. Also read The Magnesium Miracle to understand all the reasons to take this product and how to take it. I would not recommend taking it straight, always dilute it in at least 2 or more cups of water to make it palatable. I will say this magnesium does NOT have laxative effects like other magnesium products do. That is a good thing if you want to leave the house!So my experience has been positive. Please consult with your doctor before taking any supplements as your medications may need to be adjusted.~The Rebecca Review
380. This will scrub shine off of gold!!Great gets into corners too..
381. Only 4 stars because the gloves are small. The pot holders mitts work very good but do not have any silicone stripping on them which would help hold the dish better. But these are good.
382. I am a nursing student and purchased this Hemostat for my uniform. I have yet to use it but everyone compliments the cool black color. It is actually very good quality and would recommend to others!
383. Awesome! It's just what I was looking for and it really works relaxing my muscles.
384. It is still sitting in my bathroom, the instructions are worthless.  All the bottles are marked with the same description.  I will probably just throw it away.
385. My baby hated this. I thought it would be easier than a regular toothbrush but it wasn’t
386. Shipping sucked! Loose in package,  lid off  product leaked. Seems to work well though. Just be aware you may be short of product after shipping.
387. These are tasty ashwagandha gummies but the texture is more like a soft candy than real gummy which is very chewy.  Ashwagandha helps to calm me down and I sleep better at night and I've read that it helps reduce panic attacks.
388. This package contains a nice variety of dental items for dogs.
389. These dry wipes are excellent. Designed to be used with a bucket, they are strong, absorbent and versatile. They are softer than I anticipated but strong. They do not tear or leave behind lint. They can be used virtualky anywhere, garage, workshop, kitchen, bsth or office. Impressed by the quality.
390. Looking through the clear bag when my kale powder arrived, the shade of the green powder is a bit pale compared to the color of fresh kale.But curious to taste it, I added a teaspoon of powder to a 12 glass of water and just drank it....Surprisingly, it tasted fresh and sweet.  I'm just hoping this is truly what it says it is....pure organic kale powder and nothing else.  This tastes far better than so many green powders I've purchased.  No bitterness whatsoever. I feel this was a very good purchase.  I bought the pound bag...which will probably last a long time~!
391. Worked wonderfully for making slide sandals fit perfectly. I have one foot that is just a tad bit larger on top than the other and they worked great for making both fit the same.
392. Bought this for my wife, she loves it!  Colors are cool and it really protects her phone well.  Previously she had the OE Samsung flip case with replaces your back pc and doesn't protect your phone at all.  It also has a magnet that latches it shut.  Not the best built I've ever seen but it is good for the price.
393. I buy of this terrible ever light, work one month, and don't work any more,bad product.
394. These are poolshower quality ear plugs! I have bad swimmers ear, even in the shower 🚿, these come with the coolest metal keychain worthy container and a great lite neckstrap to hook up your earplugs , place the plugs in your ears and shower or swim 🏊‍♂️.. then just hang them up to dry out!
395. This stuff really works. I will not leave home without it
396. Along with an autoimmune diet this probiotic is really helping me treatreverse my autoimmune disease.
397. Title says it all
398. Unfortunately these mouth tapes are worthless junk. They don't stay on, they don't breathe, so it makes you sweat and eventually you will have a blowout early in the morning ruining your sleep cycle.
399. It wasn't helpful at all. I bought it to use on the ends of my hair. Saw no improvement. The company isn't the issue it is just the oil.
400. Small and perfect box size for friends if you're looking for something simple.
401. I love the citrus essential oils because they brighten up the room and leave a freshness to the environment.  I use this in my aromatherapy humidifier during the day.  It smells great and I think it helps to lift the spirit.  This is a great size and a really good value.
402. I bought this to begin tincturing my own stevia that I grow in my garden.  I've tried using alcohol, and can't ever seem to cook it right to get ride of the taste.  Someone recommended glycerin, so I'm giving it a shot! I'm SO excited to taste my first sample SOON!  Everyone says this has a sweet taste, but I didn't find that...of course I have a serious sweet tooth..so I can't taste mildly sweet I guess.  It's a large bottle, for the price.I will be saving a tremendous amount of money by making my own tinctures at home.  This process also doesn't require heat...you just mix it with the herb, so easy!  I'm looking for more ways to use this as a viable source for homemade items.  You know what is in the product if you make it at home!
403. This trimmer started out as a very nice trimmer.  However, after only a year, the main trimmer head has broken rendering the unit, mostly, useless.  While it worked great for the year I used it (about once per month), the trimmer head I use most of the time is broken and unusable.  I find this to be very disappointing.  The quality of this unit is very poor and one year of use for a unit of this costly makes me angry.
404. Very light and very short, even with the telescopic handle
405. love them
406. What a foursome!!!! These reading glasses arrived well before their scheduled time.. Packaging- they were well secured. and pricing .. Wow!! Well .....what can I say, you really won't regret this purchase. When I looked inspected each one I discovered they are Ingeniously crafted and I am so appreciative.  Bravo!!!! Bravo!!!! Bravo!!!! Bravo!!!!
407. I purchase the devise hoping that it will assist with my neck pain, but I feel I got 2 in one.. I used it as a "pillow" during my recent flight and it was great.Its force your neck to stretch and be in right position and its really relief neck tension. when deflated its small enough to get into my hang bag and I can use it either at home and in the office. Highly recommended
408. This is a good product. It seems to provide good protection.
409. These are the worst wraps I've ever used. I'm an Esthetician and need durable wraps. These wraps snag so easily.After just one wash, they looked horrible, I had to throw them all away. They also don't hang right.
410. Great quality instruments for those emergencies when you need to clamp off a &#34;bleeder&#34;.
411. Not accurate.... too tight on my wrist and sometimes had to restart itselfI had to return it for a refund so I could purchase a different one.
412. The replacement toothbrushes for Philip's Sonic was excellent price & quality & compatible with the toothbrush.  I would definitely buy again when I need them!
413. As a guy, exfoliating the skin is not an easy task and sometimes i get lazy (maybe most of the time to be honest) but after using the Body Bar for the first time - I was hooked! I purchased the The Body Bar - Exfoliating Body Scrub Loofah & Moisturizing Body Wash Soap 2 in 1 by Bathing Beauty. The Body Bar works amazingly well and the after effect with the Shea Butter, Aloe, & Vitamin E nourish and moisturize skin, it gently exfoliate the skin while deep cleansing. Great for everyday skin care and all skin types. I highly recommend this product for guys and girls.
414. I got this hoping that it would take care of a stress incontinent problem that I sometimes have, but have use 5 of them and still have not found it to take complete care of the problem.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  Will keep trying to see if &#34;user error&#34; is a reason for the product failure that I have experienced.
415. I use essential oils by themselves before my yoga practice and typically choose ones not diluted in a carrier oil. Even then, the scent only lasts about ten minutes.This combination is just wonderful. Clean, fresh, uplifting and balancing.Great for men and women as it’s not floral.I put it on both wrists and found myself being drawn to its unique blend. There’s something really captivating about it: energizing yet soothing.
416. Happy that it comes with a small booklet on how to stretch with it. Rolling my back on this and hamstrings feels great! Does a great job of decompressing spine. Glad I went with this product. Really hope it does not chip or damage easily.
417. These are packaged up really cute. That's pretty much where the positives end. They smell rather gross and all smell basically the same. If they get too wet they just disintegrate and disappear in seconds. There is very little scent released. In fact, I couldn't smell them at all while in the shower. After I got out I caught a whiff of very faint scent. But that's it. Totally not worth it.
418. These are the best shower scrubs I’ve ever used ! I love them. This is my second purchaseof these. They are exfoliating.. but soft, and they larger up very nicely without falling apart. Great deal.
419. Love it. Really helps with pain and strain.
420. NO more powerful than the battery version!  If you are getting this because you love the battery powered one and want a little extra power, don't waste your money.  It is a wall plug in, with a cord, but it is an adapter and is really not better than the first one I got that uses batteries. I sent it back.  I do really like the battery version.
421. The daily supplements are great to take and hard to miss. They're somewhat larger than normal, and very condensed at that. They're easily the largest pill I have to take as a supplement that is not chewable.
422. Even nicer in person than the photos, would definitely give as a gift, super cute
423. This product is fine so long as it's used properly. Obviously this is my fault for not being extra careful. Mixed up my regular solution with this bottle and lord well you can see what happened. Yes it says on the label not to put in eye like that but the packages I think needs to change as it looks to much like normal solution. After research I've seen this has happened to others as well. I just wanted to warn people about being extra extra careful.
424. Good supplement best vitamin C I've found thus far.
425. Is little tight need to wear couple time fit okay.
426. I am in my late 40's and can't see up close without my reading glasses. I recently purchased a vanity mirror for my bathroom with 5x magnification. I was horrified with what I saw! The wrinkles didn't bother me - that goes along with age. But I have lots of blackheads on my temples! I couldn't see them before. I have used the acne tools - the ones that look like dental tools and they work okay, but those often leave behind temporary redness. And you have to be precise about the location because of the small tips. I found this ultrasonic cordless skin scrubber to be much more effective at getting rid of the blackheads! And it doesn't leave behind any redness! The end of it is about an inch and a half wide and it is able to scrape out the ugly blackheads. You can see the dirt and grime on the tip after you've used it. Gross! Now as far as the scrubber goes, it comes with a charger. Once it is on, it has a vibration thing going on. It heats up a little bit, but not to the point where it is too hot to use or it burns. I just can feel a little heat from it while it is in use. There's a silicone cover to go over the metal end when it is not in use. I am thrilled to have found this!*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.
427. Good product!
428. Great taste and value. I highly recommend these to keep whole family’s immune system strong during these uncertain times
429. As advertised. Very useful.
430. I really like Magic Eraser and it has helped make products come clean when before there was no hope! Since this product came out I've tried the $1.00 imitations that worked but crumbled in the process. So I went back to the original. And I am not too happy. I used this to get scuff marks off my daughter's sneakers and true, that's a big task but it crumbled and much more elbow grease was needed than I remember. I think that the ones with the blue scrubber side are better..  I'll try them next time.
431. This stuff has a very strong fruity medicinal odor. It's not horrible, but it's so strong that a few squirts in the shower fills the whole house with the smell. It seems to leave the shower glass clean and clear, but I've used other daily products that worked better and didn't smell so much. I won't be buying this again.
432. This sandalwood oil smells wonderful, I love it. It is not overpoweringly strong but it is strong enough to be smelled across the room. It also comes in a large leak proof glass bottle with a dropper included.
433. Tastes like battery acid and dried puke.  Just pay the extra money and get the capsules.I'm no ninny when it comes to choking down gross powders, but Glucosamine Sulfate tastes like Satan himself pissed in a pool of battery acid and drain cleaner, then dried it out and sold it as a joint supplement.
434. I absolutely love these masks. The design and colors are attractive to me. The material is thick and layered and they are comfortable to wear. These are perfect for the fall or the winter. They are made of 100% cotton and the current price of $14.99 for these two masks are a reasonable price at $7.50 each.
435. Offering a 2 pack works well when there are multiple users in the household. This product also states that it contains “the mother” which apparently is the more effective type of ACV to take. So far, I have taken ACV with as well as without and haven’t had any noticeable differences. It has helped to regulate our digestive tract for both my husband and I, but no weight loss benefits. We are both mature seniors which I am sure makes a difference with weight loss benefits. The taste is comparable, slightly sweet with a mild ACV hint. The size is smaller than most. The directions need clarity…2 or 3.
436. Use this product to help with restless legs. Seems to work well and for the price it’s better than picking up at the grocery store!
437. This blackhead remover vacuum is amazing. It has an app that you can download to access the 20x magnifying camera so that you can see it actually helping your skin. It's kind of cool to actually watch the blackheads, whiteheads and makeup particles being removed from your skin. It has great suction power. It's easy to use and takes less than three minutes to finish your entire face. It's made well and is durable and seems to be long lasting. This makes a great gift. I'm very happy with this purchase. Great value
438. Bought for my dad who is wheelchair bound, and gets terrible sores. He's always complaining about the pain and we've tried at least 6 different foam and gel cushions. This is the first time he feels comfortable sitting! Very grateful for such a great product, reasonably priced.
439. If you have small glasses like mine, it can be hard to find clip-on sunglasses. These work perfectly. You might need to bend the outer clips to get them to fit over thick lenses, but that's no big deal. Note that the sunglass coating does scratch relatively easy, so keep them protected when not in use.
440. I'm an ER RN. I work 12-16 hour shifts. Compression socks are essential and I've tried a ton and these are my absolute favorite
441. Footstool was a great purchase and has been very helpful to me.  It is very steadystable and I feel safe using it.
442. This product smells great! It is very relaxing and it spreads throughout the house! I got this product with a discount.
443. You will love this sonic cleaner. It is waterproof and it is soft. It does a great job cleaning. Oh, the purple version is a special edition which is no longer available and you can get it now in black or pink only.
444. One squirt is all you need to cover up bathroom odors!  Not loaded up with chemicals and fake smells.AND one squirt means it lasts far longer than all the other sprays!
445. For a basic eye mask of this style, it is attractive, budget friendly, and are well made. Blocks out light via not only the outer material but also an internal piece of flannel stitched in. I'm not sure why it has a pocket. Nothing to come out. Perhaps to add your own additional padding or black out material? No idea.Not adjustable, but there is a lot of stretch. How loose or tight this fits depends on your head. I think it would be easy enough to make an adjustment to smaller size with a couple of quick stitches (and I am not one to sew).  I like that it isn't adjustable because usually the adjustable part snags my hair, or I can feel it against my head.However, it being a little large to start is good because I have a large head. My head measures 23.75", this fits me without feeling too snug. Most feel way too snug. But at some point in night I didnt like the feel. Not sure why yet.Material is nice, stitching is good, comfortable when first on. Over course of night I could feel some pressure. I eventually took it off. I think these will be used for the occasional nap or when I need to just rest my eyes. For me, I think the pressure is due to the use of slim elastic AND the opening to that pocket area. I can just feel it at some point. Most all eye masks use slim elastic and what it does (for me) is create pressure across eye area where it pulls on the material through there. But since this isn't too snug feeling, I think it has more to do with that crease where the pocket it. More material to smash against my face.So initially comfortable but then turns uncomfortable. Your experience may vary.Quality overall seems fine. Love the 3 pack. Love the floral design of the ones I selected. It just isn't quite for me, sadly. I'll try it a few more times. If I experience anything else, I will let you know. In the mean time these are just "OK". Hence 3 starsOddly, my favorite sleep mask is one that no one else seems to like, lol. I keep waiting for it to come back so I can buy another, or maybe I will figure out a way to make one for myself. I am linking it in case you too have a big head and are bothered by the pressure of the slim elastic. Or at very least can see what I mean by largewide elastic.https:www.amazon.comdpB07RJQGV61
446. They look nice but they are hard to put on and they don’t stay up. Too tight for me. I prefer the 10-20 mmHg.
447. Full disclosure: I totally thought this was a joke. I saw the image in the description of the ironic hipster holding a green smoothie and thought this was a &#34;soylent green&#34; type gag gift for your literary friends who like a dark joke. Turns out this is actually a legit meal replacement powder. Boy I feel silly, having a giant tub of neutral flavored Slim Fast sitting on the counter forever now.
448. Nice plates & napkins for a birthday celebration.
449. These are fantastic
450. It's essentially a velcro-strap waistband with a gel pack inside for heat or cold therapy. I ordered this to replace an old one I had that was no longer usable. This wrap is a quality product, and comes with a gel pack that is much larger than the old one I was using, which is great. You can also place smaller gel packs in the "pocket" if you wish, but so far I've found the larger gel pack that comes with it to be preferable. Works GREAT for lower back pain, gives relief in just a few minutes. Easy to put on and remove as well. There are lots of these for sale here but this one is exceptionally good in my opinion.
451. Nice lemony smell and taste, if any. Easy to take.
452. This is a great case for purse or briefcase. Comes in handy on a belt for outdoor hikes...would recommend for sure.
453. Keeps everything organized and reminds me to take my pills.
454. Wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
455. If you’re not comfortable using gloves when handling clay and other artist’s materials, these are great! Made of silicone, this set comes in 3 sizes. The small fits my pinky, the medium fits my index finger and the large is for my thumb. They have little dot nubs on them but you can turn them inside out for a completely smooth surface. Reusable, washable so it’s eco friendly. Comes in 4 sets of small, medium and large (12 total).
456. Vegetable Glycerin ( or glycerol ) is a clear ,odorless liquid that has a sweet taste. The liquid is produced from plants usually  palm oil , coconut oil or soy. It has many uses cosmetics, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste. I use it in my  vapor juice or e-juice. In e-cigs it is generally referred to as VG. It produces more vapor than propylene glycol, another component in e-cigs. I find the 99% pure Kosher VG is an outstanding product with an excellent price. I also use Vegetable Glycerin with essential oils and I make moisturizers and hair conditioners with it. It needs to be stores away from sunlight and has a shelf life between 12 - 18 months ( shelf life does vary )
457. i like it. only support you can truly boost back up when it lessens to resupport you. hand pump worked for about a yr and a half and then went. but I like it
458. Like but don't love. Wiggles around too much and causes fatigue in sensitive areas. Use for no more than 4 hours a day.
459. This Cordless Auto Curler is horrible. It did not have instructions for how to put my hair into the curler so I watched a video of a similar curler. I put a small piece of my freshly washed, combed hair over the section to curl my hair. I pushed the button to curl my hair, the section that rotates in the middle grabbed my hair but not all of it at once. My hair got caught in the curler and I had to pull it to get my hair out. It damaged my hair.The box comes with a curler, a base, and a power cord. It has vague instructions when it comes to actually put your hair into the curler. It does have instructions on the different settings.I WILL NOT be recommending this Cordless Auto Curler to family, friends, or even enemies
460. bought it for my son and he didnt want to tell me that there was something wrong with the charging cord or battery.  I still haven't heard back from the seller
461. I have been able to reuse them, it is a tight squeeze putting them back togetherBe careful, they do not fit all bottle inserts
462. Works like a charm on my beret.
463. This filter is working fairly well in our shower.  Hubs isn't tall so it didn't affect him, but I am tall and it comes to just a an inch or so above my head.  I can still take a shower but the shower spray is not as diffuse as before.  Installing the filter was basically a no-brainer.  Take off shower head, install filter apparatus (even plumbing tape is included), put shower head back on.  We don't have a hard water problem here, but I like knowing a lot of chemicals are being filtered out.  I don't know how long these filters will last but I will be ordering more just to have on hand.
464. The perfect item for my emergency supply kit.  It fits perfect and built solid.  I filled a 5 gallon bucket with my emergency supply kit and snapped this on for the lid.  I'm getting another for my rare camping trips.  No more squatting in the bushes!!
465. I am happy with the way this clipper cuts and the feature to be able to store clippings and emptyHoweverI thought that I was getting two different size clippers one for finger nails and one for toe nails that would be a larger size butThey are both the same size.I haven't tried yet to see if they can cut toe nails easily or not.There weren't any directions on how to empty but I figured it out just pull off the purple plastic covering.Easy
466. This product is great but I was a little upset that the batteries do not work continuously...almost like there is a short in the battery compartment.
467. Color is good,  stays secure in pocket.  That's all that matters
468. I would give this less stars if I could; stay far, far away.
469. Too bulky to be woren as a necklace. I thought the stones were going to be small and suitable to be worn on the neck, they are too heavy on the neck. Btw, I am 6ft tall and muscular.
470. There are 20 gallon-sized plastic storage bags in this box and each has a slider closure. The Cowboys emblem takes up the entire front side of the bag as can be seen in the attached picture.What I like about these is that they expand at the bottom. In the picture, the bag contains two 17.63 ounce containers of marcona almonds and I had room to spare.  The expandable bottom ensured that these stand up on their own.  Overall, I really like these. They do feel a bit thinner than other Ziploc bags but not so thin that it matters much.These are great for storing nuts, cheese, crayons, a wet bathing suit, and anything else that can fit into a one-gallon bag. At the current price of 9.99, this comes to $.50 cents per bag.
471. These were terrible. Neither my husband or myself could wear them they were so uncomfortable.  Could not be adjusted in any way to be comfortable.
472. Fantastic, just what I needed thank you
473. Our go-to balm for most things- baby bum's, scratches, cuts, chapped lips and hands... so many uses!
474. If your mask hurts your ears, or is too tight, this is for you. It is an earsaver package of silicone extenders and ear savers. I like that they are adjustable. For those of us with really long hair, it is nice to put the strap along the back of our neck.
475. I’d give 5 stars, but this does not moisturize very well. Need to reapply often. I’ve been looking for a good vegan lip balm that works as well as Burt’s Bees, but this isn’t it, unfortunately.
476. Easy to use gloves and helpful with washing dishes! I was concerned about the size as I have small hands and these are one size but the kinda hug your hand even if they are bigger then I’d need they stay on well!!
477. They work great I had trouble before I ordered these strips my mask would not stay n my head. I ordered these connecting strips and I'm. Very happy .
478. I have used Milk Thistle in a capsule form, in a tea form and in a glycerite but never in powdered form.  I mixed some into some warm soup and in a smoothie and found it a great way to use it.  I know it discusses baking with it but I'm pretty sure at those temperatures you would be compromising all of the antioxidants they take such care in preserving so I don't recommend it.  I liked that it was organic, GMO free and packaged well in a resealable bag.  I felt it was a good value for the amount of the product you get in the bag.
479. They aren't terrible. With such a small amount, I can gulp it down quickly. I actually had to go to look up what predigested hydrolyzed protein was. It is protein that has been reduced to the amino level. At that level, it is considered predigested and more easily absorbed.
480. It works OK.  Nothing replaces Goddards, it was uniquely effective.
481. I really like these but I took off one star because they are very heavy.
482. I do well in it did work pretty well, not sure if I’ll buy again
483. These FG Clean Wipes are great for cleaning so many things and have so many other uses, as well. They clean very well without harsh chemicals and without leaving any lint behind. They don't tear apart like paper towels, they are more like thin indestructible fiber cloths.I've kept one in my oil box and have been using it for several days to clean my Essential Oil diffusers. Just washing them with soap and water doesn't get all of the residual oils out, but these cloths do. I'm sure that one cloth will last for quite a while. I'm also keeping one on my nail table to wipe my brushes clean when using poly gels and other liquids. If I get anything on it, I can shake it off in the trash and put it in my LED lamp, so the polish or polygel can cure and I can continue using it as long as possible. I've taped one to the inside of my new LED nail lamp, so that the bottom of it doesn't get dirty with polish or other nail enhancement liquids or gels. I've used a couple of them to do a quick clean of my refrigerator, inside and out.I know I'm missing some things, but they're just so many uses for them. These are wonderful cloths and I absolutely recommend them!
484. I normally wouldn't rate tissue but these are fabulous!  Should've gotten earlier in the year!  These are so soft and heavy(?) wmoisturizing.  Soon as you touch one you will feel the difference, seriously.  Absorbent and can also use to take off makeup..especially that old mascara under yr eyes :).  These come in cube boxes which are better suited to my house and how many ppl need a box in their rms.  Getting 1 big box at a time is a time & my energy saver..$ too in the long run.  Could of used these for our summerfall allergies, poor noses!
485. The only bag out of the three that has any major decoration is the red one in the center, which has the more &#34;3D&#34; stockings. The other two are simple and have no &#34;pop out&#34; decorating. They are simple and boring and would cost $2 at any store. This is not worth the $12 I paid.
486. I bought these for a home office because I could not see the yellow highlighter on my paperwork under the light from "warm" CFLs.  Definitely a much whiter light than you might be used to (the "gas station mini-mart" look that another reviewer mentioned), but you can get excellent results if you put one of these and one "warm" CFL in a 2-bulb fixture. They're the same size as a generic 100W light bulb, so they fit any fixture; but note that they are a bit slower than most CFLs to come up to full brightness, maybe 30 seconds or so.Beware the miserable factory packaging: a tight-fitting cardboard box with zero padding.  I ordered a 2-pack, which arrived with one bulb broken. Amazon took them back and sent a replacement, and again one bulb arrived broken.  I'm going to get a third package, but this time I'll hold on to the one good bulb, so I can send back two broken ones. (Assuming they don't send me TWO broken bulbs, which is a distinct possibility.)  This is despite plenty of airbag packaging from Amazon -- I suspect they're being busted further up the supply chain.Compared to Costco's 8-pack prices on "warm" CFLs, these are relatively expensive, but with 50% losses in shipment I suppose they have to charge twice as much.
487. I did not like the feeling of these straws on my tongue. They're not perfectly smooth. I'm not going to use these straws.
488. Absolutely love this! Was a bit hesitant about it using the cordless feature but it held a strong charge for the entire process of grooming my extremely fluffy dog. Love that it came with different clipper  settings , nail clipper and file, comb, and sharp scissors. Be aware it does not have the outlet adapter but u can plug as it’s a usb charger and I just used my iPhone plug to charge it.  It’s also not too loud and my dog remained calm during the process.
489. Ok, so I have to say that my intended use is not what these are marketed for, but the are still exactly what I needed. I have some smaller fish tanks in my home and have had great difficulty in finding good cleaners for the sides of the tanks that are small enough and will not scratch. These work wonderfully for the purpose. The sticks are plastic, not paper, so they do not disintegrate and are reusable if cleaned appropriately. Very pleased.
490. I live near a train yard.I like having a nice background noise to sleep by.The sounds are nice but i dont use all of them.I picked a favorite and that works for me.A few of the sounds are a little to 'crisp' and would be better if muffled. Or if the unit was at a distance, perhaps in the hallway.
491. No support at all. Better off getting the whole foot support
492. I'll date myself here, I have been a Packers fan since Vince Lombardi days - lol. You you can surmise I was thrilled that Ziploc has Packers storage bags - easy choice to make.
493. So far so good.  My husband, who does smoke has had a lot of congestion since getting over a cold a couple months ago.  When I was looking for an NAC product, this one had excellent reviews.  I bought some for him a couple years ago but he complained it made him cough “too much”!  So this time, I went with 600mg.  He took them twice a day with a meal to avoid stomach upset. No problems there. Taking one at dinner time did cause him to cough a lot at nighttime thus affecting his sleep which then turned him into a bear!  So, he only takes one a day with his lunch and actually takes it without griping!  So far, he has been able to breathe much better and producing a lot more phlegm. I know, I know that it would be far better to just quit smoking!! Maybe someday? Also, these pills have NO odor!!!🤞. But for now, this product is working to help him and would definitely recommend.  One disappointment though was I had received a promotion from the company when I received the product for a $25 amazon gift card to apply for after using for a week.  I was to go to their website and give my review to receive it.  Their website doesn’t exist.  That was a bummer!  But overall, happy with the results of this product so far!
494. Works great holds well
495. Slides around too much on the bottom of my foot
496. I use it in the shower and like it a lot.  My husband is letting me use it for awhile to see if it holds up.  If it does he will get his own.  ****Update**  I purchased another and both died before a year.  Just stopped working without any warning at all.  When it worked they worked great but they die early.  Disappointed
497. There are three roll-on fragrances in this set of Real Love, Citrus Glow, and Frankincense. I love the Citrus Glow as it has a full-bodied orange aroma. The Frankincense is my next favorite, followed by Real Love which is my least favorite. I cannot describe the scents of the other two.I applied each to the inside of my wrists. Unfortunately, the fragrance does not last long at all (about one hour). The current price of $24.99 would be competitive if these lasted longer and if I liked all three scents. The citrus one is my only favorite.
498. I got this set about a week ago and my kid's eyes lit up when they saw them.  The enjoy playing with them a lot.  Spikes on the balls are not sharp but give good sensory feeling.  The ball is light, squishy and bouncy and the rings are more heavy sturdy built but still have some flexibility to it.  I kept one set for myself to keep at my work desk (to squish & smash) when I'm thinking or dealing with some stress.  My box came with the 3 balls and 3 rings all in the same 3 colors: Green, Pink, and Blue.  The box does show Orange and Yellow options so not sure if those are random or what but what I got matches the pics in the listing.  When I first opened, the new 'plastic' smell was strong but a week later, the smell has faded away and not a problem.  Overall, good quality and very useful.  I can see these being used and lasting a long time.
499. you have to read the ingredients. i have been drinking this tea for three days. it has little if any  taste.  in respiratory distress, because i am allergic to oranges. i have hives in my throat, choking.from now on i will read the ingredients.
500. I ordered this on a Thursday afternoon and it was delivered about 18 hours later!!!  However, I couldn't keep this on because my arm would sweat and the band slipped off!!  I found it uncomfortable, the velcro rubbed against my upper arm whenever I bent my arm.  I am really surprised that no one has mentioned the sweating!  The inside of the strap is rubber!!  I will be sending this back for a refund.
501. Heps to distribute weight to take pressure off sciatica. Comes with nice cover.
502. Arrived on time and in good condition.  This works great for cleaning oil and grim off your hands.  I would recommend for shops.  Cheaper than other brands and work better.
503. Love the Aria, it was easy setup and works great.
504. Very good product
505. I got these specifically to clean the interior of my car such as the door panels and center console. I didn't realize how dirty they were until I used these.
506. This box is gorgeous and elegant and has diamond like etchings on it. It is also as sturdy as those colorful square boxes one can buy at Home Goods. The front flap magnetically closes. Since it is a beautiful silver, no wrapping is necessary. The only problem I have is that it comes with a bow that looks like it has been run over by a truck with black marks across it  in many places (see photos).To set this box up, all I had to do was unfold it. It is one piece and unfolds into the shape shown in less than a couple of seconds. There are no ugly creases; just a beautiful and sturdy box that can be used repeatedly for storage or for gifting. This particular version is the size of a small shoebox and will hold some lingerie or a small pair of PJs. The current price of $9.99 ($11.99 plus $2 off) is competitive. However, until they fix the problem with the supplied ribbon, I recommend passing on this.  
507. Good file. Much better than most others.
508. Used for foot stability
509. Love my go to gentle but cleans
510. Not heavy! Works great! Wonderful price!
511. This brace is comfortable, and it fits into my lace up tennis shoes or work shoes. It stabilizes the ankle and lifts the toe, which prevents falls.I have ordered 3 braces, and this is the best.I gave a 4 star rating, only because the strap from the toe to the ankle was not holding after 5 weeks or so.The company is sending me a replacement at no charge. Great customer service!Update- I changed my review to a 5 star, because the company sent a new brace, not just the strap.Excellent customer service!
512. Loved the napkins!!
513. This product is a life saver for my Dad! No spills and no more risk of falling in the middle of the night when he wakes up to urinate.
514. Very high quality light. I use it at my main sewing machine. Makes a big difference. Will definitely be ordering more to put at my other machines.
515. Great replacement heads and great price.
516. Yes you can buy peroxide for less money, but this is mixed to a 3% strength, and has a nice scent to it, so it saves a lot of time and effort.  Does the job, good disinfectant.  Unless you want to fool around with mixing your own, I'd say just bite the bullet on this one.
517. When my generic Ambien doesn't work I get out of bed and take these pills. Then I'm able to get to sleep in the next fifteen to thirty minutes. Some nights I just take this along with my sleeping pills to give me a deeper sleep. When taking these natural sleep pills I find that I sleep through the night better. No waking up at odd hours of the night. I also notice I'm less anxious about sleeping when I take two pills. You are not supposed to take more than two. These do contain maltodextrin if that concerns you. The herbsplants in this formula include lemon balm and passionflower.~The Rebecca ReviewI received one free bottle for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.
518. I love this!! Previously I was using s tennis ball. This is a lot easier. I'd pay more for slightly higher qualify. However, it still works well.
519. I put this on my sofa, I ran out halfway through because you need to apply two coats. The liquid is white and the bottle is white, so I didn't realize it was almost empty. At a glance it looked like the bottle was still full, then I realized it was opaque. A lot more must come out with the sprayer than I realized!Honestly, I have not noticed much dirt and water-repelling qualities. I still have to use my Bissel Green Machine to clean up spills. It helps the liquid pool up without totally soaking into the upholstery, but it's not 100% waterproof. However, in exchange for that, it's not stiff like ScotchGuard or anything. With the small quantity I would use it on something like dining room chairs. It took too much product to cover an entire sectional.I wouldn't view this as a stain prevention method, but rather something that buys you time to clean it up with a stronger product.
520. Solid, cool looking trimmer.  Comes with 3 clip on bladecomb adjustments.  Rechargeable Li-On battery, it lasts for 2-3 hours- lit indicator.  single button. Strong cutting.  Trim the sideburns, trim the beard, eyebrows and cut designs in your hair if you want.  Nice gift for the guys.
521. Obviously they aren't named brand heads. They are generic brand from another country. They are much softer and I'm not sure how long they will last.  Doubt I will buy again. They did fit my Clarsonic Mia just fine though. So no issue there.
522. It works, but I would' buy it again.
523. First - these contain soy. Which means I cannot touch them because I'm allergic to soy. The other folks on our hiking trip all tried them instead. Why is soy required???3 out 3 hated the chocolate crisp cereal bars. All agreed they smell ok, but taste awful. There's a bit of a bitter aftertaste and a distinctly chemical type flavor to the sweetness. It wasn't like a diet cola nasty, but bad enough that none of the 3 would eat more than a couple of bites one time. I can't give the remaining bars away.
524. Coverage is Good,
525. I really like this organic kale powder! It has a subtle taste in my organic protein shakes. I use it every morning along with frozen mixed berries or frozen tropical fruit. I put the powder into a mason jar that makes it easier to get into without getting it all over my hand.
526. Works well on curling short hair
527. I discovered this at my local gymspa. I love it, just wish it was not sooooooo expensive!  I don't understand why it is so expensive, it's only coconut extract. I'd love to find something less expensive...anyone know of something similar?
528. I take a liquid vitamin, but this product made me very ill! I took it with a meal, and about 5 min after ingestion, I became sweaty and vomited. I took it 3 other different times, per instructions and each time I became violently ill, throwing up. Does Youngevity have a money back guarantee?
529. Can I go lower than one star?  I found these bars completely inedible.... and the taste vile. Usually, when I don’t like something, I put it out for the various critters in our area. I threw these away as I didn’t want to be accused of cruelty to animals. Yuck!
530. I like it. One tip though - cleaning your face is not to be underestimated. I broke out after using this and it was not the fault of the product. Rather, I brought up a lot of bacteria and spread it all around my face.
531. Functions well, well made, good price, and you get two sets.
532. These comfortable gloves are perfect for doing dishes, so your hands don’t get wet with the nasty water. They are comfortable, durable, and they look nice. They’re also easy to clean.This pack contains two of the regular gloves, and two with the soft fuzzy lining.
533. These didn't stick at all. They slid down into my shoes.
534. When you have to work from home, you need to make your chair more supportive and comfortable. this goes a long way to helpin.
535. I really love the light, clean smell of this cleaner.
536. It's kinda pricey, but fun for tracking your weight progress. Currently bummed because the instructions advise that you not use this while pregnant - definitely something to keep in mind. Other than that, it has a nice look and is super convenient for tracking weight alongside your fitbit.
537. Blows every other foot file out of the water!!!
538. Great quality product
539. Keeps my house smelling wonderful. Lasts a long while.
540. These adhere really well and stay put.  I will definitely buy again.
541. Not good for thick hair! Takes a long time doing small sections at a time! However curls come out very nice if you have the time!
542. Holds both of my EpiPens.  Seems pretty sturdy.  I added a carabiner so I could attach it to my backpack.  I like that the color stands out.Edit: I've had my original for 6 years now and it's just now starting to show wear.  It's held up really well.  I'm ordering a new one to replace it and hopefully it lasts just as long.  Very happy with this product!
543. Works ... good value for the price
544. Taking Trim Probiotic for Women has definitely made me feel better overall. I've taken probiotics for quite a while now and I always look for ones with a high CFU. 25 billion is a great number. I don't think they've made me any trimmer, but I think I've had less bloating overall. The serving size is one pill per day. Easy peasy. $50 for a month's supply isn't the most affordable, in my opinion, but I do think this is a good product.
545. As someone that takes a lot of supplements,  I was interested in adding artichoke to help with lowering cholesterol and calming a sensitive digestive system.Adding artichoke is kind of a no brainer, since most people tolerate it very well, side effects are rare and often more of a coincidence unrelated to taking this supplement.I also take tart cherry and licorice, as well as a turmericginger combo.Episodes of GERD are less and less, fingers crossed for my next blood work.
546. pretty good
547. This is a great quality probiotic strain that really can help with so many issues. For me, it helps with autoimmune inflammatory issues so much! I'm really happy with how well these work.
548. Was so uncomfortable, I sent it back.
549. Thought they were going to be pure.  copper. Package states they are stainless steel
550. Not sure why this product was even invented when any soap and water will do the same thing.  I washed a green (acrylic paint) stained acrylic-bristle brush in this and it did not get rid of very much of the green paint.  I went back to my regular hand soap and hot water to get rid of most of the rest of the paint.  Too bad, it’s less messy than my method, but not as functional.
551. I have been using this product for years and it surely does what it says it does! I use this item daily as I have sore gums & wear dentures & I must say that Benzodent does the trick.
552. I wanted to buy a good pair of ear plugs for attending concerts and live shows, which I do frequently. I was torn between these and the Etymotic Research ER20-SMC Plugs so I ordered both. They are very similar especially in terms of sound quality (most won't notice a difference, although I do believe I prefer the DownBeats sound-wise,)but the DBs are far more comfortable in the ear. I recently went on a trip and couldn't find my DBs, so I took the Etys and also realized that they are even more uncomfortable when laying, unless you sleep on your back. I prefer the case on the Etys as it opens and closes quietly, but performance and comfort are the most important qualities in ear plugs. My friend also tried both and prefers the Etys, but only because he fears the short DownBeats will get stuck somehow. Ha.
553. Decent boost, great flavor, unusual in most preworkouts, will buy again
554. So this smells like watermelon and it smells wonderful. A little goes a long way because it is a little strong but it smells delicious
555. They do not fizz at all. Not a good scent either
556. When I read mini dustpan, I thought this one would be a little bit smaller than it is. It is pretty small but I was hoping a little smaller. I do like it though and it is very versatile. The pan makes collecting the dirt easy. The brush has a brush side on one end and a squeegee side on another. This is perfect for making sure you get all the dirt.I like that the brush neatly stores within the pan. In addition they give you a small little brush that works very well in cleaning out dirt from your keyboard or other small areas. I actually use this for cleaning out the cage of my flying squirrels, it makes a job that usually takes me closer to 5 to 10 minutes a 1 minute task.The materials are also perfect that if they ever get dirty you can just clean it easily with soap and water.
557. This is actually really easy to use. The pictures are from our first attempt with a small watermelon. The slices were nowhere near perfect but still it was easier than using a knife. The rubber grip helps a lot if you get juice on your hands and the whole thing feels solid. The melon baller was ok but would actually work better on a cantaloupe or something firmer since it's a bit on the small side.I received this in return for a review. Its doubtful you will get picture perfect results without a lot of practice but it does make it better and easier.
558. Purchased these for my 92 yr. old dad. His room is tiled and these keep his feet warm and allow him to make trips to the bathroom without having to make the effort to put on slippers. These are not carried in walk in stores and so thank you Amazon for carrying these. I've purchased over 1 doz. pairs in the last few years.
559. Like this product though I had to do a trial and error to figure out the different settings.  I also found out what a mask is in Japan and ordered some face masks online as the result, though don't use the massager with them.  Certainly less expensive than a few of the other options out there.  The english translation in the booklet could be a little clearer.
560. they break easily. i keep getting packs that have bulbs with exposed wires and detached bases. other than that, they work really well. perfect daylight balanced bulbs, very bright. I replaced my entire house with these bulbs and surprisingly my utilities bill decreased
561. I ordered these because they were clear not knowing they had no screw on caps.  The lid is the cap and has a rubber seal so they do not leak.  It's just so nice not having 3 pieces floating around while they are drying in my bathroom.
562. Very firm,smooth, good quality.  I use as an exercise for balance.  It's supposed to strengthen leg muscles.
563. Has helped my husbands stomach
564. This lash curler has  teeth  along the silicon. They seem to help with after mascara lashes. It separates them and gives a more natural look. Really affordable and does the work. Comes with multiple replacement which is appreciated.
565. I love this combination of kelp and potassium.  I was feeling tired most of the time and after only using it for 2 days, I can feel an increase in my energy level.  Excellent if you use sea salt or a salt with no iodine to replenish the iodine your body needs.
566. Little pricy but gives me the opportunity to salute the "Queen of Bengazi" every day, thanks!!
567. The problem is that they wear out in just a week or so.
568. I have been taking magnesium for several years to help ward off leg cramps.  This formula is the best I have found.
569. Elevated toilets are very expensive and hard to find. This innovative product solved my problem and you cannot even notice it's there! My handyman installed it in 30 minutes and I am much the better for it as the old hips ain't what they used to be!
570. A friend recommended this product for bruises. It works! I sprayed the bruised area and rubbed it in, then sprayed a bandage and placed it on my arm overnight. I did that 3 nights in a row and the bruising was GONE! My bruises usually take over 2 WEEKS to finally fade away. This stuff really does the trick! I’m thrilled cuz I hate those “Old Lady Bruises”! They look awful. Now when I bang my arm or hand I’ll just use this stuff. HIGHLY recommend! 😀
571. This will definitely cover both upper and bottom denturel, but the container is not leak proof. It's to be used at home and not for storing dentures while traveling unless stationary.
572. No vitamins what so ever!  Must of read somewhere that it was the best bang for your buck though!
573. We had rust stains on our countertop from our metal paper towel holder. They are GONE!! It took 5 minutes for The Pink Stuff to do its job. Wow!! Never thought the stains would go away and they disappeared easily. Thank you for this amazing product! I wish I'd taken a before pic!
574. Not worth anything, kinda keeps it cleaner but barely, plus makes it even harsher after a few bowls
575. But did not fit my eyelash curler. I didn't realize they weren't all the same size.
576. Work perfectly in my Sally Hansen curler. The feel isn't as nice as the original that came with the curler but I received a whole bunch of them for less than the curler which is how it should be. The ones I received were very colorful, pink, blue, green...no black. But I don't really care as long as they fit.
577. Very good for muscle relief of neck, back, arms, and legs.
578. All of these so-called healing tools with heating elements seem to emit extremely high EMFs. I'm a super-sensitive and this thing set me off ASAP. There is an AWFUL odor that smells like burning wires that I could detect after a minute or so of heating. The pad was getting hot but I was feeling nauseated being near it so I pulled out the EMF meter. Both settings, one for electric and the other for magnetic, both fields were almost maxed out at various places on the pad. I feel scrambled just having done this experiment and had it on for less than 3 minutes. Do not recommend that this would assist human health, I think the negatives outweigh the benefits. As far as I've seen, only MediCrystal has a method to contain the dirty EMFs and have a truly healing heating pad with crystals, and this looks like a direct ripoff of their designs.
579. As expected. They perform well. I have no complaints. They do say to sterilize before use. I got my normal span of use with them before needing a change. Will repurchase.
580. I LOVE THIS LONG WEARING LIP COLOR. THIS SHADE IS A SOMEWHAT LIGHTMEDIUM PINK-MAUVE SHADE, BUT IS NOT TOO LIGHT FOR MY FAIR SKIN. I HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING COOL-TONED LIPSTICK THAT IS NOT TOO BRIGHT, & FINDING PINKS & MAUVES THAT DO NOT LOOK ROSY OR PEACH ON ME. THIS IS PERFECT WITH MY FAIR PINK SKIN WITH BLUE UNDERTONES. IF I WANT A SLIGHTLY DARKER SHADE, I MIX IT WITH ANOTHER COLOR.
581. These are almost perfect.  I've recently painted several rooms, cabinets & shelving.  I don't like having to go to the garage and haul in a big, heavy gallon of paint for a minor touch up.  I filled the tubes using the pumps which was easy & quick.  I used them once, wiped off the felt applicator & stored them in the hall closet.  I got them out again last week for more touch ups and 2 of the felt applicator tips came off.  I wasn't surprised as I read some previous reviewers had the same problem.  This really isn't a huge concern for me as from now on, I will just keep a few of the cheap foam brushes next to the tubes.  I consider it a very minor inconvenience & well worth it to not have to go back to my old way of doing touch ups.  I will be buying another set.
582. While this is a good chair for watching TV, it is not very comfortable for longer use.  It is easy to assemble but not a good purchase for the price.
583. nice looking and very good quality
584. Over the past eight months, I’ve tried a few different neck traction pillows. I’ve found they are all quite similar and accomplish the same goal, with only slight variations in design. This one, like most others, is made of a hard foam with just the slightest bit of give when you rest your head on it. It’s possible to use the pillow in either direction, one way providing a more gentle stretch, the other, a more intense stretch. This pillow does not have the bumps and nodes that some others have which are supposed to provide some acupressure and massage to your neck, though I can’t say that they make much of a difference for me. This pillow does, however, have a softer cushion in the center that makes it a little more comfortable on the back of my head. It's a very nice feature.If you’re new to this type of device, go slow. When I first used one of these pillows, I could only lie on it for a few minutes at a time, but have worked my way up to 10-15 minutes twice a day. I also recommend starting with the side that gives you the more gentle stretch. For me, using a device like this has provided quite a lot of relief to my neck and shoulders that tend to carry a lot of tension since I sit at a computer all day.If you’re looking for an alternative to medication for some relief for back and neck pain, this is definitely worth a try.
585. let me start off by saying, i'm from philly, home of the superbowl champs, the Eagles !  Dallas is not very welcome around here however, i do like to jab my husband every now and then.  I will be using these for tailgating.  We have season tickets so I will be taking these to a few games, just to freak people out.  I used one to hold some cut up watermelon and take it to work for a few coworkers.  it zipped and unzipped fine.  it didn't leak and didn't stretch.  When i unpacked it at lunch, there wasn't even a drip that came out of it.  for me, that's important.  i take fruit to work every day and also pack fruit for my whole family. i use smaller bags for them but i was treating some coworkers so i needed a large bag like this.  i used a bag to store some soft pretzels and put them in the freezer.  you really can't go wrong with ziploc.  the only thing different is the logo on the bag.  it's really a beautiful star, dallas cowboys star. if you are a dallas fan or know one, this would be a great gift for them.  what i like about ziploc bags is the zipper.  i have had others that the zipper gets stuck and i land up breaking it and the bag is useless.  i used 4 of these bags and the zipper was easy open, and easy close and strong.  i have broken zippers by tugging too hard also.  these are great bags.  this is my normal brand that i buy and have always bought, without the dallas star lol
586. This is just plain great stuff. My hair, nails and overall improvement in health can attest to that! It tastes great and given enough time to dissolve into whatever you are putting it in, is nearly clear. It takes longer to dissolve in cold beverages than hot and if you don't mix it thoroughly enough it'll get glumpy and stick to the spoon until it dissolves. Patience, it's worth it. I highly recommend this product and have already made numerous orders. We even sprinkle it on the pet food for the cats and the piggy!
587. These work great for both reading and watching TV while lying flat. They are sturdy and comfortable, and make a great gift that is actually useful.
588. Bought to clean the bottoms of my pool. Works great!
589. Great Nail Dryer
590. This diaper is very soft and well made. The velcro holds up thru washing and stays in place. It's 100% cotton and perfect for a short diaper free time to relieve a red bottom. However, it leaked through after baby peed once, so it's for extremely short use. I hope they make more absorbent ones because it is really soft and easy to put on and take off.
591. I grew up using hot water bottles when I had stomach aches or back aches. It's been harder to find hot water bottles though. This bottle is the same as I'd used for years. It is easy to fill up and comes with an additional cover to prevent people from touching the bottle when it is too hot.  While many people don't use these hot water bottles, once you've used it when you're feeling poorly, you'll see how helpful and comforting they are.  I rely on them when I'm feeling poorly and waiting for medicine or my cure to kick in.
592. Helps with a bed ridden person and you can warm them in the microwave.  They are also thick and cushioned.
593. Beautiful and fun balloons but this should not be called a “Kit”. It’s balloons. No strings and no sticks. I had to go out at the last minute to purchase the string.
594. This does work fairly well and after a bit of fiddling (my problem not the curler’s) I got it working well. It’s still an extra step I don’t always do just because of the extra time — getting set up, using it and putting it away — but when I want to go all out, this does a great job. It’s easy to use and does work.
595. Wife and daughter use and are pleased, what else can you ask for.
596. In the bathtub, this product works great. It is much easier to use than the typical baby baths and can easily be used for an infant (in the reclining position) or an older baby (in the supported sitting position).  I love the fact that this takes up less room and makes it much easier to wash the baby directly in the bathtub. The bottom seat part has rubber grips to prevent any sliding and the pillow portion floats nicely.My issue with this product is the fact that it holds a ton of water (actually absorbs the water) and then takes over 24 hours to dry. I don't know why it wasn't made to be waterproof considering it's used in a bathtub.  That said, it is still a great alternative to the traditional baby bath. It takes up less space and allows the baby more freedom to move around during bath time.
597. These are nice but I feel they are over priced.
598. While I love the convenience... it is a lot cheaper to make this yourself. The lime seems the most popular and it happens to be the easiest to make. You can buy Redmond's real salt, use the fine ground popcorn variety, as your sodium. Add some CALM for magnesium and you can get potassium powder quite cheap. You can get True Lime powder for the lime flavoring and use a packet of SteviaErythritol for the sweetener.  Voila! If you want the raspberry, just get some freeze dried raspberries and crush them into a powder and add a little.
599. Perfect!!!!  I bought this for my daughter's dorm room.  She loves it!
600. I have a 2 and 4 year old. I’m a nurse, and I love microbiology so I have studied which bacterias are commonly in the body, and which we need. This probiotic is very complete, and my kids are always very excited to eat one every night. They’re chewable and have a good taste, I tried one myself beforehand. I have had issues with others I have trued because they refuse to take them, so it’s a huge plus.Everyone should take daily probiotics, so overall I am very impressed and will keep purchasing them. Definitely recommend.
601. Easy to use
602. None of them were bent and it’s still hanging. I’ll be able to reuse.
603. Great product. My family and I noticed less gas and bloating in just a couple of days after taking prebiotic.
604. I am surprised that this is still available.  Not a surprise that is comes from England.  Sometimes I want to clear my passages without the use of drying medications.  This temporarily clears nasal passages.
605. It was difficult to know if I was getting the right filter when ordering. The one I ordered did not match the one I took out of my filter housing, but, the new one is 10 stage and it did fit. I HATE changing the filter. The company really needs to come up with a better design for ease of changing the filter.
606. Great product,  price and fast delivery.
607. The wife made me do it.
608. Although normally associated with men's health issues, especially those prostate related, pumpkin seed oil is a great supplement for both sexes. In addition to supporting the bladder and urinary tract, it is heart protective. It has powerful anti-inflammatory properties and is frequently used as an anti-parasitic. It helps with insomnia and depression.These capsules by Natures Bounty are fairly large but I had no difficulty swallowing them and experienced no unpleasant side effects. They are somewhat diuretic but I find that they do help me get a good night's sleep. My mother has sever arthritis and reported these eased her pain and stiffness. I take these as a preventative and am satisfied with this product.
609. These are great glasses to stash around the house because almost everyone can wear them, and 1.50 can help almost everyone but are not too strong. It's fun to have three different color frames, in color-coordinated snug fitting protective cases. The frames are lightweight and comfortable. I don't expect them to survive being sat upon, for instance; the plastic feels like it would snap. But they seem like they are durable. I find that they are best for reading a book, or a computer, where you are not moving your head very much, because the focal point is fairly specific. Once you turn your head a little bit, the focal point changes. More expensive glasses don't seem to do this. All in all, they are great for an emergency or -- for instance -- in the bathroom in case you need to read some fine print on a medication bottle, etc.
610. My wife love it. Well built and less cost. Great for travel and daily use
611. very nice product ..works great ..made very sturdy...great price would recommend this product to any one looking for a foot spa
612. This Horsetail extract is potent. I didn't realize that's it would give me energy. And it help relieve some joint and muscle pain within the hour. When I take it, I mix 18 tsp of it in the morning and another 18 tsp at night. Be careful with this stuff it's potent. On my first dose of this I tested with 14 tsp and I was bouncing off the walls.I mix this with the following powders: Nettle Root Extract, Curcumin Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Boswellia, Quercitin Extract, Acerola Cherry, Ashwagandha Extract, and Reishi Extract; which act like a natural anti-inflammatory and pain tonic.I'm also taking this Horsetail to help build strong bones due to the high silica content. Horsetail is a great supplement for strong bones and teeth since silica is what gets converted to calcium in the body. So this way I allow my body to produce natural calcium it needs to build bone.I will be buying more when I run out and look forward to the long term benefits of Horsetail.
613. I love these!  After wearing 'dollar store' readers for the last 4 years I decided I really needed something I didn't have to take on and take off at church and at class.  These are perfect.  Clear vision in both the 'plain' glass and in the readers I ordered in 200.Style and classy............or so my grandchildren tell me!
614. These earring hooks are super comfy! They look fantastic and sophisticated, unlike some of the other products. It comes with all the essential wire colors! Highly recommend!
615. Handy to have the week ready to go or just grab out the day.  The outer case provides additional assurance the meds stay in place while packed.
616. Price gouge much?
617. For the price, these will work.
618. Nice product to have to accommodate bedside commode.
619. These are so convenient and work great!
620. Seems to be a good IP6.
621. I have already (after 4 days use) noticed an improvement in the pain in my thigh.
622. I started taking this supplement about 2 weeks ago.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as Osteoarthritis in both knees.  Recently, I have developed tendonitis in both shoulders, so I thought I'd try this.It gave me the absolute WORST HEARTBURN ever!  I try to stay away from heartburn medications, but Pepcid is my &#34;go to&#34; for occasional hb relief, but even this would not relieve it!I will not buy again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.
623. Duplicate, needed in two rooms, kids fight over stars no more!  Thank you for posting sale.
624. One of the two pill organizers is small and the other is large. I ordered two of the large ones, but received two different sizes. Annoying. Last time I ordered two and got two of the same size.Otherwise these GSK pill dispensers are nice - better than the cheap CVS version. Although the CVS dispensers take less turns to open. These GSK organizers are better for traveling (more sturdy).
625. This came and I ordered it off experiencing it from a friend's place. It isn't as high as the old seat cushion I used but it's definitely better quality and comfortable cushion. It only has this one issue of a really weird smell. It smelled like it when it came, thought it would go away, and is simply a new product smell but has yet to go away. overall though, good product, do wish it had a thicker variation (maybe it does and I missed it?) however.
626. This brush is two-sided. The only thing I like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back. However, I would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puff.The other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and I have to stretch to reach my entire back. In addition, the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing. Why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me. There is already a hole in the handle for hanging.A self-adhesive hook is provided for hanging although I did not use that.In summary, this is functional but is the least favorite back washer I tried so far. Also, the current price of $14.99 is outrageous for this.
627.  I really liked how this is a lot more comfortable than most rope. Most rope is really rough on your skin, but this is really soft. It would be much tougher to get rope burn than with most ropes, but it holds really well, too. It's also easy to tie knots with.This is about 32 feet of rope, and so if you're going for some serious partner tying, then you probably need about three skeins to completely tie someone up.The ends are taped, and so they'll eventually fray. If you plan on reusing this rope a lot, then you'll want to burn the ends so they don't fray. It's not ultra-thick, but this also means that it goes a lot farther than thicker rope.This comes in a few different colors, and I like red the best.Pros:+Very soft and comfortable+Perfect for adult restraint fun+Holds fast without injury+Attractive rope and colorsCons:-Only 32 feet (10 meters)*Oomph gave me this rope to review*
628. This is not three ply, it's two. It's usable in an emergency, the texture is rough, but really just a novelty gift that will gather dust until it's regifted or thrown away. The printing isn't centered per sheet so it loses some of it fun if it can't be read or the emoji is half missing. Still, as a gag gift it's good for a laugh. Not much else.
629. Best facial tissue manufactured EVER in the course of human history! Yes! I have tried them all, even those ones that leave wooden splinters embedded in one's eye and nose. Ouch! That was THE MOMENT when I decided to buy Puffs Plus With Lotion exclusively. I have accidentally washed & dry them & they never fall apart and ruin the wash load, as others do. Fabulous tissue quality. Will never use any other tissue. I love this tissue so much I subscribe. It was exceedingly well packaged and arrived on time.
630. Super great taste and results are amazing.
631. I had this bench in my cart for months. I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money if it was not good quality. Finally, I ordered it so I could have a place to sit and shave my legs in the shower. It is heavy and of very good quality. Easy and fast to assemble. It is high enough where I don't have to squat to sit. It's perfect.
632. The next day upon  using the grabber it pinched my hand and I received a small cut from that, all told, the price is what attracted me so it didn't sway me. I feel I got what I paid for, no more no less.
633. After seeing some reviews, I can honestly say that this product is probably NOT for overweight people.  I'm a 5'2 130lb woman, and I loooovvvvveeee this cushion!! My butt and legs were going numb in my office chair, so I bought this. It feels squishy and soft, yet supportive. Sitting on this makes me so happy!!! It's bouncy and fun and comes in a black zip cover.
634. This is so easy to use! It took me all of 2 seconds (if that) to check my temperature after reading the instructions. There is a quick start instruction sheet and then the full instruction and care booklet. You can check the ambient temperature of the room, as well as check your temperature via the forehead or the ear canal. I checked both and the reads were really close to the same temperature, and both so easy to accomplish. Being digital is a big plus as well.It comes in a velvet bag for storage, and cleaning instructions are very easy, with no chemicals or alcohol necessary, just a wet cloth. I always have to use alcohol to wipe down my mouth thermometer, so that no germs are transferred. But this one doesn't touch saliva, so the concern of sharing sickness is minimal.I HIGHLY recommend this product.
635. Great for icing my knee after ACL reconstruction. Lighter than the Chatanooga.
636. love this product
637. It dissolves do nicely compared to other kava kava powders. I find that at a dose of 12 tsp, it is very mild (again, milder than some other kava powders I've used), and creates a nice calm feeling. Good product. Good company.
638. Bought this for my neighbor, and she loves it!
639. These are pretty large pill boxes. I can carry a week's worth of pills in one of the boxes. The plastic is pretty good quality. Latch is not fancy, but feels secure enough.
640. Very efficient!
641. I have this thermometer for 13 months and thanks god my kids are super healthy and they barely got sick. My daughter got sick yesterday and had a very high fever and this thermometer was like a joke. It gave me consecutive readings like 104.5 - 103.7 - 101.9- 101.2- I tested both ear and forehead and no luck. I knew she had a very high fever but I wanted to know exactly how much, but with this thermometer that was not possible.I tried to call the customer service because they usually want to make the customer happy...but not this time.They told me that as the warranty expired one month ago and they could not do anything. I get that...but I just thought a 24$ thermometer will last More than one year... So I guess I need to buy another thermometer, but I'm not buying Innovo ever again!
642. This product is great to put on every so often to try and prevent diaper rash. I like this product, too, as the smaller size is perfect for the diaper bag. I recommend! Only have 2 pictured but it came with 3. And don't get confused, it is a smaller tube but as I mentioned, perfect for travel!
643. Little to no taste.  I just added the powder to smoothies and it was fine.  Didn’t really alter the taste of the smoothie at all.  The bag is a decent quality, but I find these fine powders sometimes get stuck in the zip lock so dumping them in a jar has been my preferred storage way.
644. Looking forward to using this product in a couple of weeks.
645. Trying to find a way to incorporate apple cider vinegar into our diets, what could be easier than gummies? They taste good and they're effective.
646. There is no research to suggest that cordyceps mycelium is medicinal. All the research is on the fruiting body or what most people actually think of as the mushroom.
647. I am surprised at how heavy and well made they are.  They really do what they state.  It is very easy now to lay in bed and watch tv without causing pain in my neck.  I didn't really like reading with them, because I need reading glasses, so trying to wear two pair of glasses at the same time is just not comfortable for me.  My husband liked them so much, that even though he doesn't have a neck injury, he wants a pair, just because he said it was so comfortable watching tv laying flat on your back.
648. I used them for LED light therapy. I wish they blocked more light out. They stick to your eyes so be careful! I pushed them down to block out more light and getting them to unstick to my eyelids wasn’t fun. Probably better for tanning?
649. So easy to dust furniture without long edges of a rag trailing behind. I love that my hand can grip curved edges and get each and every single bit of dust.
650. I have 10.5” straws. They are a great size for larger cups, but they are a little tall for my normal Starbucks drink. I bought this shorter size so I didn’t have quite so much straw sticking up over my cup. This has been great and I don’t feel like I might impale myself on my latte straw anymore. I’ve also used in a standard 12 Oz can of soda and have been happy.What makes this set really stand out, compared to others I have purchased, is that it comes with the carry bag and the straw brushes. That’s super helpful, especially if this is a first straw purchase.
651. the hotcold therapy pack is great, I mainly use it as an ice pack.  Just strap it on and sit back and relax!
652. I'm allergic to pretty much everything so these softener dryer sheets are a lifesaver! They do not irritate my skin at all.
653. The material of this toothbrush feels cheap and light but the performance was good. I think this toothbrush is more to use outside the house like in an office or traveling. It's portable by that I mean it's a smaller size than my regular toothbrush. The power was good and cleaned my teeth well.
654. Might as well put this on subscription. Use this all the time for camping and beach. I don’t smell horrible and it makes my skin feel great.
655. Saved me from getting seasick!
656. I use Ziploc bags frequently because they make high-quality products.  Having the Seahawks logo on the bag makes it that much more special in this Washington-based home! Clear bags are a must for attending games, plus, when you're making special gifts for fellow Seahawks fans, THIS bag makes for a perfect presentation!  Go Seahawks!
657. This product looks cool and I thought I would like it. However it’s a bit difficult to open, and there have been several times where I’ve opened it and the meds have spilled out.
658. Thank you
659. works well in foods and as a supplement.  I have used this product before and a little goes a long ways.
660. I've had it for about a week and so far so good, I think. You never know with cats though, you know what I mean? I love kittens but I can't stand adult cats. So finding out that some random cat has been messing with my outdoor plants certainly doesn't help their cause. I thought about buying a zapper mat or motion detector spray but neither is workable for outside, and although I personally hate cats, I'm the only one in my family that feels this way so I thought this would be more humane. It smells like big red gum to me - I'm very happy that it doesn't smell like a bunch of disgusting chemicals - and because it can be used outside and is safe for plants and is supposed to stick around even if it rains, it seemed perfect. Also, I hate the thought of me having to invest any money into cat related crap so this seemed like the most economical choice too. I sprayed it every night the first 3 nights, including one night when it rained, and then I forgot to spray it the next day so it's been every other day since. So far my plants have remained untouched but I have no idea if it's because of the spray or because the stupid cat just hasn't been around to harass my plants yet. If my plants remain untouched after a month, I think I'll be convinced and begrudgingly buy this spray again when I run out.
661. these look better for men instead of women
662. These aren't 100% effective but they're more convenient, long lasting & durable than anything you can make. They don't last forever, though. Eventually the filter will get pretty stinky and you'll want to replace it but for this price & how long you can use it, it's still worth the investment.
663. I've had insomnia for 2+ decades.  Its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel, even when I'm in a room far from elevators, snack machines, etc.Last week we went to Atlantic City for a few days.  I was lucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snackice machines but I knew that wouldn't be enough.  I took a silk sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the best.On the first night, I was exhausted from driving and walking around all daynight, yet I couldn't sleep. Then I remembered I had packed the mask and ear plugs so I climbed out of bed and got them from my bag.  Boy, did the mask make it nice and dark!  The earplugs blessedly gave me total silence as well! I did not fall asleep immediately, but sleep DID come and that RARELY happens for me on vacation.  I usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake. What a nice surprise to actually be able to get a few hours of sleep.The mask darkened the room tremendously. Even the next morning when I woke up to a sunny, bright and cloudless day the room was still dark for me thanks to the mask.  The mask was nice and soft and the mask itself was comfortable. The band that went around my head was very tight and took a bit for me to get used to.  The earplugs did a glorious job of drowning out my husband's horrific snoring.  On the second night, I was able to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed asleep through the night, thanks to the mask that kept the light out of the room and the earplugs which, by the way, are very comfortable and flexible and soft , that kept the horrific snoring sounds as well as the maid's cart noises from the hallway silent!SO glad I had the mask and earplugs with me. I was actually able to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them~
664. This is comforting, wasn't into the music. It was nice that this came charged right out of the box so you could use it right away. Unfortunately, it has an older USB port.
665. works well on most surfaces !
666. I have tried a few different facial scrubs and was very disappointed in this one.  I have another tube of "scrub" similar to this one that I refuse to use.  I will be purchasing my favorite REAL scrub when my current tube is nearly out.  It is about half gone now so it shouldn't be too long.  What I like about MY facial scrub is that it has plenty of "scrubbies" in the paste that I put on my face.  That way I can get all the dry, flaky skin off my face, clearing the way for new, clean skin to be washed with a gentle soap and then moisturized with a light facial oil.  I have dry skin as I am older - I don't have "dual" skin with oily and dry patches.  I have dry skin, period.  The "scrubbing granules" in my favorite facial scrub ensures that all the old skin is gone.  This product is so wimpy - it has barely anything scrubby in the paste meaning I would need to use about half the tube just to get enough scrubbies on my face to get rid of the dead, dry skin on my face (especially on my forehead and around my nose).  Just not worth it for my particular skin.
667. I have no idea what Bilberry does so let me say that first!  We take these for general eye health and vision issues such as night blindness affected us ppl who are older :).  The Lutein and the Zeaxanthin were both recommended by our eye dr.  There are 60 in this bottle so it gives a one month supply to us.  Both are made from marigold extracts!
668. good product , do the work
669. First, let me start off by saying I did not have this for more than a night. I returned it quite quickly. It smelled quite toxic, which possibly could of faded with time, but I was not interested in waiting for that. On top of this, I just wasn't comfortable for me to sit on. It's quite firm, and it raises you a bit more extensively off of whatever youre sitting on than I thought. Just not for me, plus it's rather expensive.
670. Great product! Relieves upset stomach as well as heartburn.
671. I used these inserts to reduce the volume on a shoe that had a bit too much room in the toebox.  I followed the included directions cutting the insert to size and then used a hair dryer to heat mold them inside the shoes (be careful if doing this on shoes with plastic parts, the ones I was using them in were leather so molding them in place wasn't a concern).  After molding they fit and feel great.. recommended!
672. Very good, and clear sounding speaker. It definitely works better than I thought it would. It has several different sounds that was not expected. Great purchase.
673. The addition of this pad took our 15 year old massage table to the next level. While I would have liked for the pad to be a little thicker, it is a great value and we are very happy with it.I think it would easily fit a larger table and it is advertised to fit up to a 34" x 76" table.We have only used the cool side so far.
674. Good product.  Just need to be careful to line the battery with the charger &#34;prongs&#34;  or will not charge correctly.  Exactly what we needed for our phone!
675. I had been using Emjoi battery operated micro unit for years. Had tried others but they don’t come anywhere this company’s products. When I saw this was available, I couldn’t wait to order! Quick, efficient, and does just as prescribed. One of my favorite purchases!
676. I wasn't to happy with this purchase as it's just too hard and not comfortable.  If you are not using it as a neck roll then perhaps it would work for you, but if you are it wouldn't be the right purchase.
677. These last about 1 hour of continual comfortable hear.  About 1 inch across.  All these types seem pricy for a Chinese product
678. We bought this to keep the horde of feral cats in our neighborhood from using our front yard as a litter box. We followed the directions (and even extended the daily application by 4 days) but  it did very little to deter them from using our mulched area as a bathroom. If keeping wild cats out of your yard is your intended purpose for this spary, my experience is that it doesn’t do the trick.
679. Reasonably priced and a great natural supplement to help ward off bad things.  Super fast shipping too!
680.  This fish oil comes in well packaged and sealed as well as clear in its 50-day quantity as well as expiration date and various other contents. The fish oil capsule slowly melts in the mouth and it tastes delicious.
681. love it came on time works great and no complaints fantastic
682. These are exactly as described and what I expected (herb combo, size, heat delivery). so if the description suits what you think your after then don't hesitate. Arrived quickly and well packaged. I appreciate the inclusion of paper shields for ifwhen desired or needed. I thought it was a decent price too.  If you are not experienced with this sort of thing you should do some web searching for videos on moxibustion treatment (or have your acupuncturist show you) ...there's a lot of good info available. These light very easily - just as expected.
683. Puffs are very low quality. Thin and not nearly as soft as other lotion tissue. The price was not much different, so I feel the value is low. Buy Kleenex or one of many store brands that are far better quality.
684. Bought this for a friend and it works great. Also try looking for a shirt with drain holder pockets. The mesh holder is good but my friend uses a ziplock bag for the shower and then puts them in the mesh bag. Maybe try to find something water resistant to avoid getting too much water on them?
685. Love these - finally a place for larger pills
686. I got this as a gift for my nephew who is struggling with depression and medical problems. The black tourmaline is perfect to cleanse his space of negative energy and will promote healing. He loved it and really enjoyed spreading out the branches and leaves to his liking. This is a great gift and the black tourmaline is beautiful.
687. I have fibromyalgia and use this to loosen up my shoulders and relief the pain.  It works very well.  You need a small amount so the tube last longer than you think it would.  The smell is very strong when you put it on (my cat runs from the room) but gets very light quickly.  Just make sure to wash your hands immediately after use.
688. I wasn't impressed with this set - the minute I removed this stainless steel roller from the box, the roller part fell off the rod! This is a stainless steel roller, not a natural jade stone, so it's heavier and the handle appeared unable to support the top-heavy roller. The gua sha silver "stone" was alright, but the roller was obviously not made well if the head broke off upon first use. I used a pair of pliers to fix it, but am not impressed. I think I'll stick with the natural jade stone or rose quartz ones.
689. Perfect. I have been using it for the last 6 months and works as advertised.
690. Got for my daughter it helps her so great buy
691. No dislike at all. Love the toothpaste
692. I have issues with my feet. A chiropractor showed me how to relieve the pain by using a golf ball and rolling it around with the area of my foot that happens. These inserts help prevent that from happening and I can do without the golf ball.
693. I sprayed a biking backpack that I wear when I ride my bike.  I often carry food and a lot of stuff in it and it always gets grimy.  I washed it once in the machine and it did o.k. but I decided to spray it all over with this spray.  It went on fine.  The family said it had a smell but I could barely detect it.  I had enough to lay on two coats with some left over.  I haven't used my backpack yet but I needed to get a review up in time so I will update it if I think it doesn't work as advertised.
694. These are stabby
695. This has helped our 4-year-old son, who is displaying some signs of autism, tremendously!  Since beginning the fish oil, he is sleeping better, having more regular bowel movements (and fewer accidents in his underwear), talking more, playing with toys more appropriately and answering questions without simply repeating the question back to us.  The flavor is wonderful and does not taste fishy at all.  I mix it for the kids in yogurt and they gobble it down.  This fish oil has truly made a remarkable difference for us and we will be customers for life!
696. The GOOAD Dog Clippers work well and are surprisingly quiet. This is great when trimming as my dog is skittish. The rechargeable batteries and extra attachments make this a great value.
697. While it didn't miraculously make my teeth as white as snow, it did make them a bit lighter. The instructions it comes with leave much to be desired. They are very vague. It comes with whitening strips packets, the light machine and silicone teeth mold. First thing to do, you have to open the battery holder. There is a paper disk between two flat batteries to prevent them from running out since the button on the top is so sensitive, small accidental touch will turn it on.The strips come in two sizes - short and long. I tried both sizes on both sets of teeth and determined that longer goes on the top teeth and the short one goes on the lower teeth. It would have been nice to have it confirmed in the instructions. The whitening cycle times vary from 30-45 minutes with the requirement not to eat or drink one hour afterwards. The whitening light machine shuts off every 10 minutes on the dot, as if to remind not to leave it in too long. First time my teeth felt tingly and slightly cool, but then nothing out of ordinary happened. Since it has to stay put in there for a while, the saliva that collects behind the teeth has to go somewhere. I swallowed it. It was not overly unpleasant with slight traces of something. It's ok whitening kit, but it does not perform miracle.
698. I wanted something a little bit different, these are just right...
699. Anything with Gerry in it gets 5 stars automatically. :D It arrived quickly and in good condition, which is always a concern with printed materials.
700. I have read that glyconutrient therapy helps punch up the immune system to ward off viruses. I am all for this and was also looking for a supplement that will help level out our blood sugars. Since taking this product I can't say that it is a miracle drug of some kind, but can say that my blood sugars have remained normal (when before they would periodically read high) and I have not come down with a cold or flu (knock on wood). So, is it working ? I'd have to say so. It's kind of like &#34;Elephant Repellant&#34;. If you spray some around and never see an elephant.... is it working ?
701. Using this on my 6 month old baby for nebulizer. Works great.
702. Product seems well made. I have the one with extra padding. The bad part is the strength of the massage - its simply too low. Its weaker than the handheld massage devices in my opinion. I cannot see how anyone with a serious ailment gets any relief from this. Even at highest settings I did not feel it to be effective and heat was not working at all or felt like it.Does not look like it will be comfortable or recommend to put it on a sitting position. This also occupies considerable amount of space so if you have people sitting at same location you will need to move it each time.
703. These are super cheap plastic! The head doesn't even move just the handle! NOT WORTH IT!
704. Returned for a shorter half roll. This was not the right roller.
705. One of the better variety of Balance bars varieties. Super yummy, CANDY BAR LIKE! I almost wish I had never even found or tried these because they are almost too good.
706. Great product.  It works great  Easy to use. Must buy!!!
707. I was amazed at it's performance, but I decided not to buy it instead something else, no biggy
708. fits better than the knock-offs, but pricey since model is discontinued
709. So the pump did not come with the package.  Personally I don't care because I have other ways to inflate the bowl.  But because people that may not have that ability this really pisses me off.  Very unfortunate because the device does work if you can inflate it.  Fyi, my husband is disabled and bedridden.  I am 15 years younger than him so I worked thru this issue.  But if you don't have that ability don't buy this item.
710. I put one in my tiny office and another in my living room to help with cigarette smoke and animal odors.  I have not noticed one bit of difference in the smell of my home since I put them in.  I gave them two months, and now of course, cannot return them.  There is absolutely no change in either room and both rooms have no change in the air quality.
711. Based on the good reviews, I was hoping this would be better. I have a herniated disc between L5 and S1. This product is very large and very hard. It hurt my back so I will be donating it to a friend's father who is in a wheelchair.
712. Will see If the duration was worth the investment. Product works - just need to determine cost.
713. These socks are great. The fabric is soft, smooth, lovely; feels really nice next to my skin. I love how colorful & fun these compression socks are because all I've found up until now were just drab tan, black or white stockings that looked hideous. Just because I have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities (feet, calves) doesn't mean I want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose. These are so cute, bright & colorful. The only downside is that I am wearing these due to leg swelling & when my calves are real swollen (which is often unfortunately), the design on some of these socks gets stretched out, causing you to lose the very thing that makes these so pretty. The design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost on some designs & not so colorful. This hasn't happened on all the socks I've purchased from this maker, (I have about 6 pairs), but definitely on some. If you're on the thin side or don't experience much swelling, this probably won't be a problem at all. A solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes, like small & large.
714. Works great.Tip: Don't advance the dosage too fast or it can make you sicker as it activates dormant detox pathways. And don't give up on it if you feel worse. Just cut back until you find the easy safe dose, then let your cravings for it control your intake from there. Your mind will think about it and taste crave it when it's time. Use this with ReMyte, it works well together. Their other product don't make much sense to me, ymmv.It tastes EXACTLY like magnesium chloride, so I don't believe the seller's claim that chloride is removed.
715. Arrives in an extraordinary well-engineered conformal package. The pictured box arrives within a box. Kudos to the product-designers who chose this outstanding packaging method.The oil quality is the lightest I can recall and absolutely tasteless. The glass bottle and stopper are countertop accent quality.Much better than expected. Top-quality.Was my review helpful? If so, click "Helpful" so I can know.
716. Absolutely fantastic.  I use it daily when I shower.  Great relief for dry, itchy skin.
717. Excellent product! Mixes beautifully well with water, making it easy for on-the-go portability. I have also blended it with fresh strawberries, as well as fresh blackberries, for a twist on lemonade. This will be a regular item. Tastes great, especially when it is hot outside. Would highly recommend it!!!
718. This could be a useful mini razor for traveling. I say "could" since I can't say how well it shaves -- I was never able to get it to turn on. I initially thought it was shipped with a discharged battery, which is sometimes the case with rechargeable products. However, after letting it charge for a few hours, it still would not turn on. The shaver got rather warm while charging, and the charge indicator light turned on, but those were the only indications of life.The design is something I've not come across before. It's a rotary shaver, but the heads are arranged in a straight line. The heads are smaller than is customary on a rotary. The construction is all plastic and feels rather cheap. Still, it has some nice grip points and feels pretty good in hand. As a travel shaver, the lightweight nature and the smaller size could be plusses.Since it failed to turn on at all, the only rating I can give is 1 star. A shame, since I would have liked to see the shaving performance of the linear-arranged rotary heads.
719. Mounting bracket would not tighten because the material is too weak.  I bent the bracket to fit tighter, but it just bent back when tightening.  I finally screwed the bracket to the column by drilling and tapping.Hooks for the basket were too tight to install it.  had to be re-shaped to be functional.
720. Ordered wrong one but still can use it
721. This is the best product in the market. I swear by it. Just like the people on the 'my big fat greek wedding', i always say &#34;did you put some glycerin on it?&#34; my pimple.... put some at night - over night it reduces the swelling and makes it ready to &#34;pop&#34; in the morning. i don't even dilute it with anything...
722. I like it! Despite some reviews I have decided to buy and it worked great. I used in couple of projects (once as an additive to epoxy glue) and it is brighter and longer than a lot of medium and higher class watch hands.
723. Doesn't do for my big size cat...Brush is very not flexible, hard...my cat doesn't like it at all...
724. This is my third purchase of Better Sleep earplugs. I LOVE THEM. Hubby had had his nose broken SEVEN times (football), so he doesn't just snore: his nose speaks alien languages! I'm not the best at caring for them. I just pull them out and put them on the head of the bed. Then sometimes the cats bat  them around or the grandkids in residence mix them with Playdoh.But that's okay because these earplugs are washable!After 8-12 months I replace them.They're a bargain because they REALLY WORK!
725. I don't tolerate all peppermint well.  I have both acid reflux and a hiatal hernia, so somethings help, some make it worse.I tried these and they have a "soft" taste, you get the peppermint, but it doesn't irritate going down.Recommended for those who want a SMOOOOOTH peppermint to just ease a tummy issue, like upset, nausea.Will keep these as a staple in my medicine chest and kitchen cupboard!  OH and I LIKE the tin :-)
726. Overall it's not bad! I have had better tasting types of hydration packets or powders (See: Nuun). I think that while the salt count is fairly low compared to other brands, the saltiness stands out more with this brand. Overall it does what it needs to do and I feel equally as good after my runs as I do with other brands. I think, based on price alone, I would purchase again since this brand appears to be slightly cheaper than other brands for the quantity offered. overall i would give a 7.5 out of 10.
727. I try to wash my face very infrequently when possible because overwashing just gets it to produce more oils.  But when I need to remove makeup or I will wash my face anyway (shower), I really like this wash.  It seems completely natural, gentle, and I don't feel it chipping away at my microbiome.Seems to be a health- and eco-conscious product.
728. My husband likes his and highly recommends this item.
729. The only sturdy travel transparent case out there..
730. - UPDATE - After 6 months of on and off usage (I would guess about 125 wearings) the main band hook-and-loop (Velcro is one brand of hook-and-loop) type closure is shot!  The 2 straps start separating as soon as they are attached. One good cough or bending over and SCRITCH!...it pops open.  I am most certainly not a big person so I am not stressing the connection in that respect. ALL hook-and loop does wear out. The hooks start to get straightened out with repeated pulls of the loop side and subsequently they stop grabbing and holding the loop.  The highest quality products have thick, stout hooks that last a very long time.  I feel that should you plan on wearing this item everyday you may be buying 2 or 3 a year.  Aside from this issue rendering the brace unwearable I still feel this is a fantastic brace.*ORIGINAL POST*This is not the first posture corrector I  have purchased through Amazon but it will be the last.  This is a very well engineered and constructed product and I commend the sellermanufacturer on delivering a corrector that actually works!I had been going through progressive slouching, shoulder slump, and FHP (Forward Head Position)...to the layman like me that just means not looking straight ahead but down to differing degrees.  I had been told that I was looking down all the time.  In actively assessing myself I found that to be true.  This observation of slumping over and head position led me to understand why I was going through progressive upper back, shoulder, and neck pain.  Every morning and evening I was on an acetaminophen and ibuprofen regimen.My previous posture corrector experience was awful.  Poorly engineered, uncomfortable, and one size fits all seems to be the norm.In receiving this product box I was a bit apprehensive;  I didn't want further disappointment.  I gave this purchase a 4 star review for two reasons.  I really want to give a 5 star review because the product ACTUALLY WORKS AS ADVERTISED but there are a couple of issues. If I could give a 4.5 star review I would. For better or worse positive change occurs on Amazon through the process of accurate and honest reviews.My first reason for not rating my experience as a 5 may seem petty to some but I feel it has importance.  On opening the box and removing the brace there was not a single stitch of product literature included.  In my humble opinion, basic information regarding the product itself, guarantee explanation with returnrefund information, and some basic seller contact information should have been included.  There were none of the pages that can be seen on the Amazon website that are just great.  Copies of the photos and fitting instructions should also have been with the product. I was going back and forth between my computer and my bathroom mirror to assure proper fitment. When I first put this on it did not feel right and I found that I was wearing it too low by looking at the photo of the model.  For future reference, when not logged on to the computer, having package inserts would be fantastic.Now to the corrector. Once I was properly fitted it was immediately obvious that this device was going to prove beneficial.  When I first strapped it on it seemed that I would only receive moderate correction.  I realized that I was not holding my shoulders, neck, and head up straight and in proper alignment before stretching and attaching the shoulder straps to the belly band.  Upon doing this correctly, a significant amount of support was felt.  By pulling pretty tight on the straps while in proper posture before attachment of the bands, my alignment is now perfect. My posture without the corrector was poor...but not as bad as I have seen with other people. In order to retain proper alignment with the corrector I had to give the straps a pretty good stretch.  I am 5'11&#34; tall and 190 pounds.  It is only reasonable that the device straps will have to be pulled tighter for a bulkier person; there is just going to be more physical resistance to correction. If you are smaller than me such tension may not be required.This is where my second issue is keeping me from a 5 star review comes up.  For those of use requiring extra tension on the straps to maintain proper spinal alignment, the straps can &#34;cut&#34; into the armpits to an uncomfortable degree.  Some sort of well designed underarm cushioning would be greatly appreciated.Lastly, I can only wear this brace for about 2 hours before my back muscles start aching.  I do not consider this to be a negative in any way...actually it is quite the opposite.  This lets me know the brace is working as advertised.  Those muscles in my back have been stretching and stretching over the years and are at the heart of my poor posture.  They are not enjoying being &#34;re-compressed&#34;.  Tough!  Over time muscle fibers begin to grow together.  This corrector, I feel, will facilitate just that. Take tension off the brace as soon as you begin to feel any of the aching I have described above.  Continued use after that point will cause discomfort for some time after the brace is removed.  For some people I imagine this period of initial correction may be as short as 45 minutes to an hour (perhaps even less for the elderly...I am going to get one for my 70 year old mother if she gives in to trying it. It takes time to gain new muscle memory.  The longer you use the device every day the length of time you will be able to wear it comfortably will most likely extend. In using this corrector, these aching muscles will begin to calm down over time.  The support is not just holding things in place, it is forcing the body to improve itself.  I fully believe that actual POSTURAL HEALING will take place and down the road I will only need the support as a  reminder rather than a maintainer.I wear a T-shirt every day and even when tightly tucked in the corrector is virtually invisible underneath it.  From when I first put the corrector on in the morning I do not take it off until bedtime.  I simply go through comfortable cycles of tensioning the main strap and releasing it when I feel it is needed...the device is lightweight and unobtrusive.  Only the tightest or sheerest of clothing would give away it's presence.Bravo Tigoof!  You really have a winner here and I highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing postural issues such as mine (slouching, Forward Head Position, and shoulder slumping) and suffering from the chronic neck and shoulder pain that I was.  As an aside, my working at the computer for any extended period of time would get to feeling fiery in the upper back. I don't do computer work now without the brace,  and no longer experience that discomfort. I HIGHLY recommend this support to long duration computer users.This is a fantastic product you should feel very secure in purchasing.  The few negative things I mentioned are more than likely issues specific to me (or perhaps to other people my size or larger).  I am confident that if you order the correct size and find the just-right fit for you this corrector will prove itself to be quite an asset.  If you don't feel just that way, contact the seller.  They are fantastic to work with.  I can't wait for my few issues to be dealt with in some fashion for all future purchasers so I can I can come back and give this product a SOLID 5 STAR RATING! I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.Good Day & Good Back,STLaffoon
731. The mask is easy to clean,has elastic to hold on the child's head. But it runs small,it did not fit my nine year oldest face. It also has a strong chemical smell.
732. So far so good. I watched the cats on our cameras turn away from where I sprayed this product. The only problem is you need to spray it about every other day. I hope this continues to work or the next stop for the cats is the humane league.
733. Great product would buy again.
734. fits better than the original on my arm.
735. Kind of bulky, it does the job.
736. I was so-so with this product.  I was thinking it was OK, if you wanted to spend the money.  Then I fell.  A stupid fall, no need to explain.  With 60 as my next birthday, I was in some severe pain.  I thought......Copper calf compression sleeves.....why?  Well, I totally wiped out my right calf....not in the back, but the front.  I fell duh.  I am now a convert.  There is nothing greater than copper sleeves.  I now have elbow, and hand gloves.  This company rocks it cool.
737. really liked this as did everyone who smelled it. wish the bottle would have been a little bigger and the shower gel didnt smell very long.
738. One of the finest whey isolate protein powders available.  Fantastic for the lactose intolerant.  Flavors that are some of the best I have ever had.  This one is for the Chocolate.  Best Chocolate ever.
739. This is a great back brace.  The only issue is that I bought it for my 80-year old father and it is difficult for him to put it on himself.  Well constructed and comfortable even when pulled quite tight.  Definitely helps with posture.
740. also I like that the days can be separated.
741. It clean the way they say
742. Bought this to help with bruising after surgery and I think it worked a bit but I didn’t use it more than a week or so, and I also used ice so I’m not sure.
743. Put it in and it fits fine around my car seat.  I don’t think any cartruck seat will have a problem if it is a bucket seat. I will test it out and adjust the review if I have any issues..  So far it seems supportive.  I like the fact that there is no memory foam, so no odor.  It came shipped in a big box so no issues with the quality of the product upon arrival.  If I can figure out where I put my calcium everything would be great.Update-Air freshner smell stuck to product and does not smell like lavender.  Returned.
744. Very disappointed. Would not hold liquid. The opening kept popping open. Woke up two mornings with an empty brush. Would not recommend. Went back to an Oxo brand brush with a screw on dispenser.
745. This review process with Amazon has changed, you read reviews to a product that has nothing to do with the product your looking at
746. Easy to breath in . Very big . Easier to talk in . Washes well.
747. Pretty sweet and has the artificial taste of an orange starburst, not really a flavor I want in a drink. Someone that doesn't mind artificially sweetened drinks may not find the flavor to be an issue.Would highly recommend using cold water to drink this down because it helps cut the sickly sweetness.I took half a scoop midday which comes out to 125mg of caffeine, about the strength of a cup of coffee.I didn't feel too jittery, anxious or crazy just a little more "up" and focused during my workout.So overall I didn't care too much for the flavor, but I enjoy the effects so I'll continue to use it, and just drink it quickly. haha
748. These lens wipes work really well and we're very happy with them. Good price for so many of them.
749. Its really good i am using every day good for health
750. Purchased this to add in a smoothie recipe.  This is fantastic flavor and I am sure packed with major nutrients.  I would definitely recommend to someone who makes smoothies all of the time.  I put a teaspoon in blender with frozen cherries, banana, orange juice and it was spectacular.  Will purchase again!
751. Solves a common problem! Almost everyone who has ever used an Ace bandage for more than a day or two has lost some, if not all, the clips. And dropping a clip onto a hard floor and accidently stepping on it renders it useless. So what do you do when you need to use that Ace bandage, but have too few or worse yet, no clips at all? I've tried using safety pins as an alternative when I have no clips, but found that is really not a good solution, as it does not hold the end of the bandage evenly. This Pack of 50 clips will last a long time and I'm glad that it's a pack of 50, as they are not really durable, so they have to be replaced fairly often, like 3-4 days. But they are a much better alternative than to safety pins and certainly buying another expensive Ace Bandage.. They also come in handy to use on a really wide Ace Bandage, as the number of clips supplied by Ace seems inadequate. I'm glad I bought them!
752. Good product,  buy them all the time
753. This item really should not be sold here as it is temperature sensitive and needs to be shipped with an ice pack during the warm months. Who knows what the temps are in the AMAZON warehouses? I would say to stick with buying this from your local practitioner because after it has been subjected to the heat, it probably is no longer good at all or less strength at best. Waste of money to buy a probiotic that no longer works!
754. These are super soft and nice. I give lower rating because when a few hours they were flattened and hard. I realize it will in time, but expected it would still provide SOME cushion.
755. To me there is nothing like a full mesh body puff. It is the only thing I use in the shower outside of a back brush. Nevertheless, these mitts have the best of two worlds. The mesh is thin and sewn onto the glove. The glove has two finger holes for the thumb depending on which side is being used. If I want a sudsy wash, I pull this on like a glove and use the mesh side. If I want to exfoliate, I turn it over and use the rough side. It also has a loop for hanging.It does not replace my favorite shower sponge but this comes close. Also, these can be used to wash the dishes if one does not want to use them for the shower.The current price of $13.98 comes to an expensive $6.99 per mitt.
756. I do like this product but it only has one hot temperature and although it has buttons to adjust the temperature of the brush, they don't do anything.
757. So far the pills are fine and easy to take and thank you for the quick mailing them.
758. My boyfriend needed a new clipper and cordless seemed the best option.  I can help him and he'd have a easier time cutting his hair.  these clippers are amazin,  trust me!!!
759. I was pleasantly surprised how these pads helped easy pain on the balls of my feet when wearing heels. I was skeptical, but now I’m not. Recommended!
760. Very soft. Easy to put on. There are strands of the yarn poking through the front, so I don't know how well it will wear over time.
761. Bought this for my niece... she loves it !
762. These seemed to work well at first, but they loose their effectiveness after a while. Don't work as well as they are supposed to.
763. This machine is amazing. It has many different attachments and gets you where you want to be. Great price too. I was going to order elsewhere and they wanted like 150 and this is way less and comes with way more. Its strong and is well worth the buy
764. Got this for my son for Christmas.  He LOVES it!! He's a welder in a machine shop and his body pays a price. It arrived today and he tested it out at my urging with no real hope for it doing much...he's had other products in the past and nothing really gets into deep tissue and reverberates out and makes a difference for him to have any relief.  I did his back for 10 mins with this...and he was smiling!! Not to make his mom feel good but because something finally got his muscles to relax.  The 2 heads on this are what I think do the trick for making it all happen.  The various speeds and alternate attachments will be an added benefit in the long run.  It's easy to balance and he managed as well to do it but not as good as when someone else does it LoL
765. I got these, they were a great deal, but I feel like they stink until you get used to them. They are somewhat soft, but not like I’d expect from tissue with lotion.
766. It has the touch and strength of high-end plastic cutlery. Labeled "Compostable in Industrial Facilities" and that you should "check locally as these do not exist in many communities." It probably goes without saying that these are not suitable for backyard composting. The bonus is that these are made from renewable sources.
767. Went to the dentist for a fitted plastic retainer for $150 and use this at night. Amazing whitening with zero gum or tooth pain. (crest white strips hurt my gums)
768. Useless; the spring is bigger and coarser than other brands I've tried, and didn't even epilate.  I felt nothing pulling or epilating when I used it, but did when I  immediately tried  my older wand from another company.  I threw these 2 away.  Thankfully, they were not expensive.  I've learned Bellabe is worth the extra money.
769. When I was growing up my mother was always trying to sneak healthy ingredients into our food without us knowing. Spirulina powder is a much more subtle way of doing just that. Mixing it in with acidic sauces or dressings completely mask the flavor. I add it to spaghetti and lasagna and no one suspects a thing. Great way to sneak in some iron and protein!
770. It's kind of hard to mess up basic dish gloves. These are pretty standard gloves and they perform just as well as any others I've ever used. The center of the palm has slightly textured area to improve your trip on wet dishes. I'm allergic to latex and these did not cause any rash, hives, or redness and itching, so they seem to actually be latex free.
771. These eyeglass cases are very handy and cute.  They fit in my purse really well.  The order came quickly.  I was pleased.
772. Love, but a bit on the heavy side
773. These masks are super cute and comfortable, the stretchy band could be just a hair larger, or even adjustable, but other then that, they are great! I love there is a pocket for the gel pack. i get migraines often so these are so helpful!
774. Great for cake pops
775. My rocking Santa is a whimsical addition to my window sill. I enjoy seeing him rocking.
776. The last time I ever smelled smelling salts was when I was a kid and another kid in the neighborhood had a bottle of them for some reason.  We all smelled it and I haven't forgotten how strong it smelled.  These Westside Barbell smelling salts are just as strong.  However this time, I used the technique I learned in chemistry class in college which was NOT to stick my nose right over the flask, beaker or whatever container, but to hold it out from my face and waft the air over it with my hand towards my snout.  These are very good smelling salts.
777. 1st day had a headache and jaws were clinched.  Waited a few days -(because I wanted focus and memory)- and tried with 12 of a capsule and stayed on that dose for a week without any headache or clinched jaw side effects.  After a week went to 1 full capsule and love the results.  I have so much energy, drive, motivation, focus and ability to remember.  I really think that at 67 I have lost a lot of my &#34;mind&#34;.  With Optimind, I am back like I was in my 20's.  If you think it is expensive, call them and order 6 bottles at a time, it gets the cost down to $25 a bottle.  My husband, who usually just laughs at my supplements, tried one, he takes one daily now.  Both of us love what it does for our mind and energy.  After 3 weeks on them, thought I probably should take a day and rest, well, I did rest, after cleaning out the garage, cleaning my car inside and out, two hours of  shopping and coming home to fix dinner.  Before Optimind, I would open the garage door look at the mess, and close the door - it all seemed like too big of a job. Most supplements are hype, not Optimind.  Not sure why it didn't work for the people that rated it anything less than a 5 unless they are some of the few people that still have their &#34;minds&#34; intact.  I'll gladly give up other things to afford Optimind.  Besides with Optimind, I save money from not paying others to do, what I was too tired to do or couldn't focus or think clearly enough to do.
778. Arrived on time. Strength equipment to others of same strength. Narrow, rimless lens perfect for reading & watching tv at same time.
779. I finally found the readers that do not look like readers!  I have been looking for this specific design for well over a year. The packing is lovely.  A glass zippered case with wipe cloth, looks exactly like in picture.  I love these and will order extra pair.
780. Used it for less than two months and it died!DO NOT BUY!!!
781. Bought the 2 pack, one for my 94 year old grandma and another for my nephews. Only used it with my grandma, but I know my nephews will get a kick out of it too. I used to have them when I was young. My grandma and I both enjoyed them. Keep in mind the measurements, they're pretty small.
782. Lovely aroma, it smells also like cologne? It's really strong but I got used to it after one day. Many happy compliments from anyone that has gotten into my car.
783. These are a great solution for life's little inconsistencies.  Very comfortable and discreet. I would recommend this product.
784. We been using it since 2016, the Germ Guardian GG1000 7” Pluggable Small Air Purifier  and it works!  We use it in the bathroom never had a problem with it.
785. Some of them fit and are a really neat concept but all of them are basically cut different sizes and shapes. I would rather have something tighter fitting to use a device. All of the finger lengths are random. A stretchy fabric would be helpful, even a 5050 cotton blend.
786. This is an excellent hair styling tool! My hair is difficult to have lasting curlswaves! But, with this my hair style lasts for at least two days;I definitely recommend this one!I give it two Big Thumbs up!!
787. This was an inexpensive piece to roll cones but honestly I found this to be difficult to use.  It's really hard to fill after rolling paper around it.  It becomes a frustrating situation to the point where I roll cones by hand quicker than using this tool.
788. Seemed to really help my adrenal fatigue
789. Cute small boxes. The color pops. They came very well packaged so none came in bent.
790. No better than drugstore hot water bottle.
791. I'm sorry to say that my bottle arrives busted, and therefor I couldn't really use it. I sopped up some of the loose liquid and worked it into a stone floor. I knew exactly what I was planning to use this on, so I got straight to it. I just have one spot in my late 30s, early 40s Sears kit home that has an unsealed rough stone floor. I have been wanting to find something that could clean that floor. Nothing ever describes what I have, so I have been reticent to buy anything. So I haven't used anything! When I saw that this product can be used on pavers, bricks, sidewalks, etc I figured that was much closer to what I have in terms of porosity. So here I am with a busted bottle, and just a rags worth of product, and I dab it onto one spot. It really seems promising. This isnt a case of "oh, I can use anything".. and I certainly cant use a power washer. Hm, maybe a steamer.. but yeh, I need a cleaner. This could be it, but I dont have enough to work with. I am highly considering just buying another bottle (but concerned about another broken bottle). Personally, I think the price point is reasonable, hence why I never rate on price. IF I do buy another bottle (currently have one sitting in my cart) I will be back to update.
792. I figured I'd try the Vanilla since I do like a couple of other flavors but this flavor is awful, it doesn't even taste like vanilla.
793. The container are only half filled and it’s not smooth but it seem to work on the itchy bites. I used it on flea bites
794. I bought these for giving my baked goods to friends. They are just the right size, sturdy, and even more beautiful in person than in the photos. Instead of light pink ribbons shown in the ad, mine are a hot pink, which makes the boxes pop to life. The thank you cards are a lovely ecru color and are packaged in clear resealable plastic (2 packages of 6). The cards have matching envelopes and are the quality you would expect to find in high end boutiques. This set really deserves 10 stars. They can be used for so many things--trinkets, birthdays, Valentine's Day, wedding showers. The boxes are the perfect size and the price is very affordable for such luxury. Thank you Amazon for this great set!
795. The case was over all a buy, it holds my MLG Gunnars fine and is a nice coated leather. The only issue that I would say it has, is that it is kind of flimsy when opening, however the magnets hold when the case is closed.
796. Neem oil is great for hair and skin. It helps strengthen strands and improves elasticity. It encourages hair growth and can prevent unnecessary shedding. It is also good for fighting wrinkles. The capsules are filled with oil. You can easily puncture them with a thumbtack or sewing needle and add them to either hair or skin products. Another great use is to add some to your favorite clay mask to make it dry down slower. I think this is a great buy.Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
797. These were hideous. I tried to pawn them off and no one likes them. It ended up being a food we tricked people to eat as a joke.
798. For the price point, this is an excellent cuticle nipper. The edge is shard and precise. Comparable in quality to a $20 nipper.
799. These are nice paper towels, both with looks and function. They're thicker than any I've used, and much more absorbent, too. They have perforations, and they're easy to tear off one, but the paper towels themselves aren't easily torn. I've been quite pleased with them.
800. I love camu camu for an extra Vitamin C boost.  I sprinkle it very lightly into shakes, as such potent vitamin C has laxative powers.  So start small.  Yay for organic!
801. Took all stains out off clothes, then other brands
802. Folks, these earplugs pose a risk of getting stuck deep inside your ear. I see from the reviews I’m not the only one.I only wore these a couple of times. One of them got stuck in my ear canal. These are silicone and extremely small, but don’t have stemshandles like other other silicone earplugs, to prevent them from adhering deep inside your ear canal. If my RN friend had not been able to extract the earplug, I would’ve had to go to urgent care or the ER. Getting something like this stuck in your ear could potentially damage your hearing.I urge you to buy other earplugs, potentially with stemshandles. You’re trying to protect your hearing - not risk it.
803. Most of us know that Maca is a superfood, well this is amped up superfood from Peru that aids the body in healing, boosting the immune system and filled with amino acids that are fuel for out bodies. There is no taste to it, so I put a tsp in my smoothies along with Maca and a Warrior blend plant based protein powder that I know will give me all I need as I can't eat due to dental surgery.
804. I was really excited to get this for my husband but the power button does not work. It only turns on if I push the speed button... but since that turns it on, I cant change the speed... if my husband tries to put any pressure on it (lay his neck on it) it just shuts off! Very disappointed...
805. Nice thick nail files
806. I need co to repond to this question, why was label saying 50% knotweed placed over the original that says 20%?  Which is it?
807. Husband loves this warm and cozy item.  Should have had one in the beginning.
808. This Spotlight toothpaste says it's vegan and claims to rebuild enamel but I showed this to my dentist and she was skeptical. She recommends Sensodyne which has much stronger ingredients to fight tooth decay and eroding enamel. I suspected as much - I didn't like the texture of this toothpaste and though it does have fluoride (thank goodness), I don't feel the same sensation of cleanliness I get with Colgate Total or Sensodyne. It feels very mild and there is no foaming action. There are many obscure toothpastes like these on the market that claim to be "healthier" but I have yet to find any equivalent to what's already working for me. Oh well.
809. These were surprisingly great quality and easy to put together! They scratched off perfectly and were a lot of fun for the guest at our bridal shower.
810. Great in a smoothie
811. Replaced our sound machine that we had for many years.  Perfect white noise!
812. Sadly as cute as they are, the scent didn't last more than a day. I will use them all but I don't think I will return for more.
813. I gave a five star for this product is great. The taste is hard to get used too, but I mix it in 100% grape juice and it is very good. The juice is good for you plus the energy greens and I feel wonderful. I am 73 yrs old and I can work rings around my husband and  kids. I will continue to take the All day Energy Greens as long as I can afford it.
814. These little nail buffers are not just for doing nails! They are great for all sorts of projects & hobbies. They are just like the larger foam sanding blocks that you can get at Lowes or Home Depot, but much smaller (3.75" x 1") . So you can have very granular control. However, be warned, they are pretty abrasive. 60 grit on one side & 100 on the other. So NOT for fine sanding. Overall, a great deal for this large pack of sanding blocks.
815. Best spray wax on the market by a longshot. The durability of other spray on rinse off products doesn't even compare to this product. Have had this last 6+ months after properly clay barring a vehicle. Perfect for wheels as well.
816. Water is so important for much health reasons. The flavor is very concentrated, so only 12 of dropper is needed in 8-10 ox of water.This brand of flavors is delicious and pure. My favorite is the coconut flavor and the pineapplecoconut.
817. This took awhile to arrive but that was expected since it was being shipped overseas. I was having trouble with my little finger catching (think it's called trigger finger). Surgery recommended for nervetendon tightness. After telling my chiropractor, he had something similar to this (but 100s more) and rubbedscraped it along the the side of my hand & just under the finger. After only a few visits the finger &#34;caught&#34; less & less. So much for the surgery!! I use this tool whenever I feel the finger even threatening to catch. My massage therapist uses something like this but it's made of obsidian...which is sold on Amazon but cost is just a little more & think it may come in a multi-pack. This one is just right for my needs.
818. Love the bleach tablets! Though expensive for only 40, they have helped with my asthma. I can't breathe in the bleach fumes and this is a way of preventing it! And they are easy to use and work!
819. The carpet in my town home is 13+ years old, so it has seen better days. It wasn’t even new when I moved in. And, the management doesn’t offer carpet cleaning anymore (the old one did). They also don’t replace the carpets either, unless you move out.So, naturally I want something to refresh.And, with all the bad things out there, trying to find a nice “good” refreshener is a chore.Seeing this, I thought – “why not” …And, I found out why not.The package is atrocious. The product, despite having a seal, sprinkled out. The seal wasn’t easy to remove, and more product flies out.Let’s talk about scent – if you have a problem with strong scents … STAY AWAY!!Since it is just my mother and I in the household, we have no small kids or pets – we sprinkled this on the carpet.It says to wait 15 minutes. Now, we only sprinkled a small area. But, after 5 minutes, we had to get rid of it. So, we vacuumed it up.THAT MADE IT WORSE! O-M-G!! It smelled like old tuna cans and peppermint! Gross.Effective? I cannot believe any germ would stay around with this. It did lighten the carpet, but I had to toss the rest of this due to the scent.It is definitely not worth the $9.99 it is currently listed as. It isn’t something I would get again or recommend.Now, I need to find out how to get the stench out!
820. When Bill G. publicly announced the coming outbreak of smallpox this old time cure immediately became popular (oct.nov.2021). Then Merck found some "mis-labeled vials" lol  of smallpox!! Coincidence "we think not". Be prepared. This product is made in India.
821. Remote worked great
822. One of the reasons I avoided Bento boxes has been the cleaning.  I like to whip through lunches at night.  I love that I can have two trays and just swap them out and throw one in the dishwasher at night.  Works great!  A must have if you do daily lunches and don't want to waste time cleaningdrying trays before packing a bento box. :)
823. Works great. Easy plug in.
824. These work great, as expected.
825. Pros:- organic and non-gmo- no filler ingredients- beautiful vibrant green color- great superfood- good benefits for breastfeeding mothers- no strong taste other than some spice- good in juiceCons:- could upset stomach if you take it on an empty stomach- bag would not reseal so I had to put it in a different container- bag is kind of small
826. It cute the very clean. Very sharp.
827. I can't blow out a candle through this mask so they're decent for filtering. They're comfortable on my large head. They stand off my face well so they're comfortable even in the Florida heat for long term wearing. The nose bar blocks off enough air that I can get a fair seal and not too much fogging of my glasses. Plus, I like the black better than white or blue. I've worn several so far and not one has failed. Would recommend.
828. Had a glass shower and it works well to remove water from walls
829. These are great!  I bought the unflavored balms, and they have a perfectly natural, neutral smell to them and zero taste.  They keep my lips from getting chapped and go on smoothly.  I would buy these again.
830. i feel like this is the perfect contour pillow, because it lowers your heads and provide perfect support to your neck. i love the design of it, i wake up feeling alot more active while using this pillow. The only bad thing about this pillow is, it has a very strong chemical smell, it wont go away for a good 24 hours. i would highly recommend if you order this particular pillow please dont sleep on the night it arrive, let it air out for at least 2 days.Hope this helps :)
831. Not what I expected. Lining too light for me. Maybe for a jogger its fine, but offers no no protection.
832. I like this small dustpan and brush set and prefer to use it for our dining room table and my desk. It helps remove the different crumbs or eraser bits more effectively than using a brush or sponge or my hand.  It also is small enough to keep in a desk drawer and encourages me to tidy up.
833. was not impressed with using this. Wasn't able to scrub things and have it remove the food.
834. This is my FAVOITE organic Barley Grass on the market. It’s fresher, it’s felt in a smoothie immediately, it’s easy to use and it’s detoxing. Add some dulse while you’re at it (dulse flakes are cheap), a banana, 2 cups organic blueberries , 3 oranges (or 3 cups organic orange juice). Oh, yum. Compliments of Medical Medium.
835. THIS WAS A GREAT PARTY PACK, AND A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY.  WOULD CERTAINLY ORDER AGAIN FOR NEXT YEAR.
836. This gel is terrific. I inadvertently got a serious sunburn on my back. I was at an outdoor function. The sun must have been stronger than I realized because it penetrated my shirt. Probably the worst burn I've ever gotten. this provided almost immediate relief. The aloe is soothing and healing. The menthol is cooling. It does have a strong minty fragrance, almost like a supercharged mouthwash. I wish it was either unscented or lighter. But the bottom line is it provides pain relief quickly and stimulates healing. Great stuff.
837. Comfortable and easy care.
838. They work okay but my ear canals are super sensitive to the pressure which makes them hard to wear during sleep which is why I bought him.
839. My cousin told me about this, since my wife is taking miralax via Dr’s orders, to help her! She started these about 2 weeks ago, dropped the miralax, and the results are great!! Seems to be all natural! She had to cut it down to half, because it was working too well! So far she is very happy with it, other than the taste! If you like figs and dates, it’s a bit like that taste, maybe little more sour, and it sticks to your teeth! She takes it at supper and has fruit or dessert after ti cover the taste! I’ve tried it and do not really mind the taste, other that it definitely sticks to your teeth! If you’re having “going to the bathroom issues”, it’s definitely worth a try!
840. These make great gifts for the jewelry lover who loves to travel.
841. leaves pattern on food tears too easy
842. This oil smells like perfume. It is a fragrance oil or blend, not an essential oil. There's no such thing as vanilla essential oil. And, there is no evidence whatsoever that this is any type of certified organic anything. Real organic actual essential oils have to be certified. In the world of vanilla, there are vanilla absolutes, vanilla extract, vanilla flavoring, and vanilla fragrance oils or blends. Please do your research before purchasing this product. This is a vanilla fragrance oil or blend that is not meant to go into a diffuser. The price is also an indicator that this is not a true vanilla absolute, which is what would be used in a diffuser or in soaps. Vanilla absolutes are expensive. These are cheap and they smell cheap. They do not smell anything like vanilla at all. They smell like perfume. Not a good perfume and not a vanilla perfume. I would not recommend whatever kind of oils these are at all.
843. A little expensive. But very good
844. This has been doing a great job at keeping my toilets clean. My only complaint is that it has a bromine smell to it which reminds me of a public restroom at a swimming pool. Not a bad smell but definitely noticeable. The time savings is worth it to me. Nothing an air freshener can’t mask anyway.
845. I do a LOT of research before buying or trying products, and it's been a while since I've had a product that made me so happy.  I think this is a great value product.When I first started working with a personal trainer a few years ago, one of the first things he made me buy was a foam roller.&#34;Why?&#34;  I asked&#34;So you can work out knots in your muscles.  Trust me, you’ll want it&#34;So I ordered one of those giant long big blue foam rollers that they have in gyms.  It was cumbersome, but it was effective.  I didn't realize how tight my muscles were until I rolled on these rollers and let the weight of my body press against the roller.  It was so good but so painful.  And as much as I liked using it, I hated storing it.  I was living in a loft at the time and that thing was really unsightly.Then I saw this 3 in 1 roller and was really excited to try it.  The 3 in 1 roller has basically 3 rollers that stack neatly inside one another.  There’s the outer roller (most similar to what I had before), a gear shaped roller for more targeted pressure points, and a rolling massage stick.  It’s shorter but I’m still able to fit both legs on the roller.  It also cost the same as my giant long blue tube roller.  I like that it's compact enough to hide from sight when not in use.  I like the firmness of the large roller and small roller, and the whole kit feels very sturdy and well constructed.  The only slightly annoying thing is that the massage stick fits very snug into the gear roller so it takes a lot of effort to pull out, and I worry whether the handle might break over time.  Better that than too loose and constantly falling out, I guess.Foam rolling works based on the idea that pressure applied to certain body parts helps to work out knots and relieve pain.  Until I started using foam rollers I didn’t realize how many knots I had in my body.  I do stretches regularly but you still don’t get it all out.There are a number of great roller positions you can use.  The ones I find most effective are for my quads and hamstring.  You prop your roller onto your hamstrings (or quads) and hold a low plank with the weight centred over the roller.  Hold position for a few seconds at a time where you feel pain  discomfort and slowly roll up and down every part of your legs.  The same concept works with calves and glutes.  Just roll slowly onto the roller putting as much weight as you can on the point of contact between the roller and your body.My back and neck are often sore, so I’ll lie on my back with the large roller tucked under my lower back and then arch backwards.  With the gear roller, I like propping it under my neck and pushing down on the pain pressure points.  I’ve also run the massage stick up and down sore spots on my neck and along my shoulders.Overall there are lots of uses and plenty of exercises you can look up online.  It’s a great way to work out muscle knots and relieve soreness and tightness from exercise.  It also loosens your muscles and prevents tearing.  I received a review sample of this roller for my honest opinion, and I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase another if I were to misplace this one.
846. Grainy, does not dissolve.  it's like sand in the bottom of a cup
847. Just like the product from so many years ago! Great!
848. srsly?  I'm sure the buckets would be great if they were useable. find a local dealer so this doesn't happen to you.
849. I couldn’t get this to spray nicely. It started to spray in a stream, not a mist.
850. It works well, and its aroma is, for me, quite pleasant. Follow the directions and your shoes will revive (at least mine did).
851. No complaints and no smell
852. As a full-time caregiver of a person suffering the symptoms of Alzheimer's, I've been struggling with finding good products for her dual incontinence issues.  After finding a great adult diaper that holds her through the night, we've noticed that the diapers have an unpleasant smell to them (worth a bit of odor if I don't have to do laundry of the complete bedding 1-2x per day).  My sister works as a medical assistant and she told me that this is what all the medical assistants keep at their desks to eliminate odors whenever an exam room needs it.  I ordered this product as well as another one by a different manufacturer.  Hands down, this is the far superiior product (same as used at the hospital).  While they both worked on the odor, this one only takes 1-2 sprays in the room and the odors disappear, and the best part is the small fragrance you smell once you spray, goes away and it just smells fresh!!  I cannot recommend this product enough!!
853. My boy, Donut, couldnt go a day without Ferretone. Every ferret loves it!!
854. I like the price! $62...
855. I am so disappointed! When I opened the package I saw these cute little purple sachets! I wanted to put them in drawers and in my closet. They are just that, a cute sachet! There is no scent whatsoever. Absolutely none!
856. The ingredients in this tend to be difficult to notice as the effects aren't really immediate, but over time they are noticeable and offer a fantastic boost. Cordyceps has many benefits along with Lions Mane. I really enjoy the full assortment in this blend and have made sure it's added to my continuous use list of supplements.
857. These are great although for tight spaces they will break off in your teeth and you have to be adventurous to get them out. But otherwise they do the job they are intended to do.
858. The brush fits perfect on my Clarisonic (the main reason I bought the brushes) however I noticed a very strong stench coming from the brush after about 3 washes! Very disappointed I guess you do pay for what you get !
859. Very BIG. bigger than I thought. It does hold a lot of oils, but some of my bottles are bigger than doterra. So the bigger bottles take up more space and the next area is not available therefore cutting down on the number of oils in the case. I am also curious how the foam holds up or breaks down when oils get on it. Is there a replacement for the foam insert? The case is sturdy and I appreciate the handle. Makes it a lot easier than the cardboard box I had them in :)
860. not a bad pillow, worth a try.
861. This is a really nice size balloon.  We didn't have any helium handy so we just filled it with air.  Inflates easy and held the air overnight so no issues there.  Great for kids birthday parties.  I checked with a local store and they will fill the balloon for use for a nominal charge (they said $1.99 same as if we bought the balloon at the store).  Great fun balloon.
862. The item fit way too big and the item could not be returned to seller. One hot mess
863. I was skeptical about the effectiveness of this supplement, but after using it for a few weeks, I can confidently say that it has significantly improved my cognitive abilities.One of the most impressive features of Cervello is its unique formula that combines natural and synthetic ingredients, providing a balanced and effective approach to memory improvement. The blend includes well-known compounds such as ginkgo biloba and Bacopa monnieri, along with other lesser-known substances that have been scientifically proven to support memory function.What I appreciated the most about Cervello was how it delivered noticeable results without any adverse side effects. I didn't experience any jitters, nausea, or headaches that are commonly associated with other memory-enhancing supplements. Instead, I felt more focused, alert, and capable of retaining information, whether it was at work or in my personal life.Overall, I highly recommend Cervello to anyone looking for a safe and effective way to improve their memory. This pill is a game-changer for those who value their cognitive health and are looking for a science-backed solution to enhance their mental capacity.
864. There are four black lanyards in this package. The loop is too small to get my head through. If I extend the pushbutton adjuster to the very end so that there is no loop (meaning the inclusion of the mask on the ends will create the loop), it is still too small. Also, I cannot get any of the clasps to open to attach the masks. I squeezed and squeezed and they barely budged. This is complete garbage and that is where I put this--in the trash.
865. It works!
866. I don't know why people were complaining about set up. I set my scale on a hard floor, and it took me all of 10 seconds to connect it, and then it told me to weigh myself. It was absolutely easy.The sleek design is so attractive! The bottom of the scale is covered in a bubble look and it really does look futuristic. This connected nicely to my Fitbit, and My Fitness Pal. Infact, I weighed myself, and it auto uploaded without me touching a button. So that was nice.I'm really glad I invested the money for this scale. It seems to be accurate, seeing as how I was just weighed at the doctors office 1 week ago and have lost a few lbs off that number. Which I am trying to do. So as far as accuracy goes, this seems to be right on key.I need to keep it hidden from my kids though because it says not to be used by anyone under 10. And the look is just too tempting.The display is nice! It recognizes you by the account you set up and calls you by your initials. You can also set up multiple users. I am really happy with this purchase. ( So far :)UPDATE may 6 2014.  Got on the scale this morning and it read one weight.  Which I thought was impossible.  So I got back on.  It was 4 lbs down.  Huh?  Got on again... 2 lbs up.  Got on again.  1.2 lbs down.  This scale is messed up, and I am returning it.  I know my body fluctuates but not like this... And not in a 5 min time frame.  The scale integrates nicely with MFP, but make sure you watch it for inconsistencies. Mine is a white one.  And I originally really liked it.  However, I've weighed myself only a handful of times since I got it, and it fluctuates like mad
867. nice to have the different sizes, it does crumble a pill with a heavy coating but you can't stop that. the blade could be a little stronger.
868. Buy it! Great natural energy!
869. I own and have been using straight razors for years. I figured I would try a shavette for those times when I dont feel or have the time to strop or touch up the edge on the standard straight edge. I bought two of them to see which one I would like. Both are the &#34;push type.&#34;This one is all coated metal and is heavier than my standard straights. Even heavier than my Spartacus str8s. But the main reason I am writing this review is how even the blade sits in this unit. With this unit the blade fits perfectly even in the holder. The heavier metal really holds the blade in place beautifully tight and perfectly exposed. The other shavette I got was the cut throat with a multi colored wood handle from Ebay for $15.The handle was nice but the blade holder metal was quite a bit thinner and the edge of the blade was not evenly exposed. That is because the two metal edges where the blade comes through are not even. One edge is higher than the other and not parallel from one side to the other. As the metal is thin, I tried to bend the two edges so they would line up better. No luck. Once metal is bent, it is hardened. Summary, this Matte slide out is a higher quality unit with quality control that is necessary for the blade to be exposed evenly.  Fun to shave with and convenient.
870. I bought these to wear when I take my contacts out.  FYI, they are a little wide.  I am a girl and I think they are meant for big headed boys.  :)  All the same, I love the style.  Just wish they were a little bit tighter at the temples.  The appear to be good quality and I don't see any distortion in the lens.
871. This beet root powder smells like dirt and the taste is very strong and NOT good.  I’ve tried mixing it with other flavors but haven’t been able to mask the bad flavor!  Further - even though I’ve ingested it anyway - I’ve noticed NO results as far as increased energy or anything else.  Will not purchase this ever again.
872. Received it the other day & wore it last night. So many problems with it. I have very sensitive skin & particularly the chin section created a rash on my chin & no matter what I did it would slip up over my mouth. The openings for the ears were not even close to where my ears are. It did keep my mouth closed (because the chin material kept covering it) but there was nothing there that I can rave about.  Waste of money - is now in the trash.
873. Great price for so many. I love dreft. Use it on regular clothes not just the babies stuff. It literally gets out most stains we have from wine to spaghetti sauce and everything kids can get into in between like slime and dirt
874. These storage containers are smaller than I expected, but they still work well for bringing food to work or school in a lunch bag. They work well for salads, pasta, rice and small quantities of other leftovers. The lids fit securely but go on and off easily. The containers are easy to clean since they are dishwasher safe on the top shelf. This item comes with a total of thirty containers, in six sets of five.
875. Great quality!
876. I bought this for my granddaughter and my daughter gets stopped all the time asked where she got it!  I fits her well and she looks darling in it!
877. In theory I love this product however it really didn't work that well maybe it's cuz I wear makeup but I feel like half the world words make up
878. Bone marrow is a very good source of nutrition that most people no longer get, me included.  I didn't even know about the health benefits of bone marrow until a few short months ago.  When I saw this supplement available for review I wanted to try it.  I think it's very good, and very high quality.  I just can't deal with taking 4 capsule of it each day.  I will have to bust them open and pour the contents into soups or something.  I have other forms of bone marrow supplements that I like better such as a thick gravy kind that is already seasoned and all I have to do is spoon it into a casserole, meatloaf, soup, etc.... and stir it in before cooking it.  And I have a bone marrow supplement that's chocolate flavored that I can mix up in a smoothie.  All are good forms and if you have no trouble swallowing pills or capsules I think this would be a great choice.
879. I was trying to find a basic sticker to put on my granddaughters books to say who they were from and when. I do not know what I was thinking buying these. They would be awesome for a invitation or something like that. Too fancy and pricey for a label. My fault !!!!
880. Product well described by seller. Construction is sound with no nails protruding. Hinge works well. This essential oil box is exactly what I needed to house my EO bottles ranging from 5 to 15 ml. Would recommend the purchase of this box to a friend.
881. not as good as extra strength though,,,,I normally use the extra strength,,,,and after taking these,,,I did notice they were not as good
882. Best bug repellent, especially great on sensitive skin with a pleasant oder
883. Not the beat quality. They were different sizes and thickness
884. Great protein bars. Great flavor.
885. Run smaller than ad photo but works.
886. The first issue was that the soap didn't come out of the wand. Easily solved by poking a larger hole in the soap wand using a paring knife. Second issue was that even after creating a larger opening for soap to come out, the sponge was too thickdense for the soap to saturate sufficiently. Again, an easy fix - I simply used my paring knife to make a small slit in the center of the sponge. At this point, despite having to make these minor adjustments, I was still OK with the product because, hey, this scrubber is always in my sink, and I always have a knife that needs cleaning. So despite the fact that a product *should* perform as intended without the need for alterations, the literal 5-second investment was worth it in a world where Scotch-brite refills have apparently gone the way of the dodo. But I digress. The real issue -- and this one is insurmountable -- is that the flipping sponge pops off of the little bracket that attaches it to the wand...every...single...time!! Honestly, I hate stinky sponges that sit in and around sinks so much that I actually thought about purchasing some sort of waterproof glue to reattach the sponges to the brackets...but I mean, c'mon. Anyway, total pass on this one.
887. Perfect for what I needed. Great price as well . I even ordered a second one after receiving the first one . Pill cutter and grinder are very easy to use . And the travel case is perfect for keeping extra meds I may need in my car !
888. This gave me a swollen eye and ridiculous lashes that curled on themselves all the way back to my eyelid.The sticky rods TORE MY SKIN OPEN. There was a little piece of my skin stuck to the rod, and a hole on my eyelid. Wtf. Removing the super sticky rods caused my lids to bruise all along the lashline.Then my eye swelled up either because of the trauma, or because of product getting into the wound. Either way, bad news.Eyes are delicate, don't mess with this.No ingredients listed, no brand to complain to. This is imported from China with no consumer safety guarantees.
889. I was very pleased with my order.  I ordered this for a friend.  My friend really liked the poster.  My order arrived in a timely manner.
890. The taste is good. The ingredients are healthy and keto-friendly, other than Sucralose. I have consumed Bulletproof coffee regularly for years, so I am used to this type of coffee. One issue is the price, which is currently $3.50 per cup. If you have four cups per day, that is $14 per day and this pack will only last five days. You can make coffee at home, add your own butter, MCT oil and, collagen at a cost of $0.40 - $1 per cup. Where this product makes sense is when you are away from home, such as in the office or while traveling. For that use case, this product is good. Spending $3.50 on a cup of coffee is too much though.The other issue is that this product is not keto-friendly since it has Sucralose, which will spike insulin. The amount of Sucralose in this is not disclosed.
891. Description was worded unclear. Product is of good quality and I’m assuming if I was pregnant would be helpful but for my situation was not applicable.
892. Wow, cleaned my BBQ so beautifully, plus my two wood stoves and the bricks around them.
893. This smells almost rotten, like something in it has gone bad.  I couldn't stand the smell so I threw it away and got a different brand.
894. I thought maybe I goofed and these insoles were for a childs shoe.  They are so narrow and small.I put my heel in and the front part barely comes to the ball of my foot.  And so narrow that the edges are uncomfortable on the sides of my feet.Not worth the effort to even peel and stick them into my shoe.
895. This is a great pill container! I have one and purchased another for a friend. The look is very classy and great to throw in the suitcase or purse when traveling.
896. Love these.  I am a nurse and my arms get cold, but I am too hot with a full shirt.  These r perfect.  Look really nice and well made.  Highly recommended!!
897. It is a strong astringent so is great for oral health, tightening gums. I dilute three drops in a teaspoon of water to swish and then dab a little on my deepest wrinkles. It is reducing them a lot. how funny. It looks like blood and would stain but outside the dumb name, it is great stuff.
898. The jar is neutral in color and attractive, but the best thing about it is that I don’t have to strike repeatedly to get the matches to light. The stick-on paper is a surprisingly effective striking surface.
899. Great stuff for all stomach issues.  Works great on dogs as well healed my Bulldogs stomach
900. i like using the heart rate monitor, thats the only thing i liked. its kinda bulky and only has time in military form. the app sucks i didn't understand a thing on it just the settings, that was the main reason why i didn't like it. so i decided to just buy the new fitbit ulta. I'm still keeping the morefit though because of the heart rate.
901. Glucosamine from Viva Labs is an excellent product with triple strength, I am so happy I got this product at an excellent price of 2.99 and free shipping, it is unbeatable. Try it and you will experience the difference.
902. works well. Easy to setup. very accurate. Use it with Hoyer lift and sling to weigh wheelchair bound person that can't stand on a normal scale.
903. I really really love it, perfect  size and I love the color.
904. Discreet packaging, padded envelope that makes it appear as tools.Heads up, if it gets hard to blow through, it's from overuse and it just needs to dry off
905. When I first got this gel, I thought that there was no way it was going to work but it does AND it is a large tube so you get your moneys worth. I have spinal stenosis and the weather is changing which means that I have more pain than normal but this gel has eased my joint pain. I recommend to everyone who suffers from arthritis, joint pain, stenosis, or even fibromyalgia.  I received this item either free or greatly discounted since I am a nation wide product tester and my testimony is true and unbiased
906. what I like about this gauze is that is is soft, stretchy and goes on without much fuss unlike standard gauze which is not soft, not stretchy and falls off while you are trying to wrap it and you cuss a lot as your wounds weep or worse bleed and you have to start all over again and then you just sit in a pile of crappy gauze crying in frustration.But not this gauze.Also, very nicely priced.
907. I should have read more reviews. They don't come with instructions or ingredients or anything, and look like someone took a larger pack and separated it into smaller ones manually. Previously we'd gotten some from our dentist, and the instructions were to chew one tablet. She did - and it was terrible. The taste almost made her throw up, and then it stained her lips, teeth, tongue and our sink. COPIOUS amounts of dye. I did wash out the sink with soap eventually, but I had to brush her teeth quite a bit to get the purple off, and her tongue is still purple and she has purple spots on her face. I'm now worried about an allergic reaction after reading the review where the child had breathing problems. I'll be watching her carefully tonight. They did disclose plaque, but for our needs, they won't work. $7 wasted. Very disappointed.
908. I cannot use it, it’s crammed into the case it came in and cannot be removed. Broke carry case to get I out. I bought this for the carry case...the file is nice just the case is the issue
909. These gloves do exactly what they're made to do: protect your hands from dirt, grime and water. The gloves are comfortable; however just a tad too big. I have long fingers so the length is perfect, but they are a little baggy. No worries! They still work well for washing dishes and general cleaning around the house. Be sure to note that only the teal gloves are flocked and the pink and white gloves are not. I'm fine with either, but that may cause an issue to others.
910. Back support
911. I like them so much that I got some for my kids and signif other.  Found that I really only need one per day though.  Great product!
912. Definitely don't drink it straight from the bottle. Burned my throat and it was sore for three days.
913. I recently broke my left fibula and bought this to be able to put my shoes on and it's one of the best Amazon purchases I ever made. I love how it is adjustable and it works perfectly. Then I twisted my right knee and had to get this back out. Now I keep it on a hook in a designated place because it's that valuable to me now!
914. Do NOT play fetch with this as I can see it getting lodged in your dogs throat if caught wrong.My pups seem to enjoy chewing on this. I have medium sized dogs they did however chew off a very small piece of this product....making me reduce the stars. Any dig chew where the dog can easily chew off the product is not good as the dog will swallow it.
915. Just as pictured. Good quality.
916. These lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck but they can only be hooked onto masks that have a very thin elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end. The cord is sufficiently long and can be cinched tighter or looser around the neck if needed. I felt it was roomy enough cinched partway down.The chains are colorful and work well. The current price of $5.99 is excellent for this as it comes to $1.20 per lanyard. I really like fun color of these chains; however, my absolute favorite mask chain is , which is more than 12 times the price but is also an eyeglass chain, jewelry, and a mask holder.
917. I bought these for my daughter and her family. I put their names in between the designs and it turned out so cute. My son in law, 2 granddaughters and my daughter wore their Christmas hats all day on Christmas day. They loved them. They are so different from the usual red Christmas hats with the white trimming. I had bought them another set but they liked these better. I bought the lettering from Amazon too. SO CUTE. Wish I knew how to take and photo and download to the section to add photos.
918. This is something I have been adding to my smoothies, and in that situation, the flavor works fine. I don’t like the taste well enough to just mix with milk, but in my vanilla yogurt, frozen blackberries, splash of apple juice smoothies, it is just fine.As far as pain relief, I haven’t noticed any at all. I have an autoimmune arthritis, which the reason I tried this, but haven’t had any reduction in pain. This probably takes time to work, like glucosamine does. I intend to keep using it and will update.
919. Great Bottles!
920. This is much bigger than I thought it would be.  It has held up pretty well.
921. I love the colors and that we can store 4 batteries in each case and we can also attach them together. I think this is a great buy if you need to take batteries with you or simply store them organized.
922. I found Method Foaming Body Wash 2 years ago when I broke my wrist. I had to use a plastic sleeve to shower and it was difficult to handle a bar of soap and washcloth with the other hand. I read a suggestion about body wash and I found this in the grocery market. The one I found was the green one and I really loved it.  I can't find it anywhere now but found this orange one here on Amazon. The green was sold out but the orange was available. I was happy to grab a couple of them because I don't know if or when I'll see them again. It's really nice stuff.
923. These worked great. Sturdy and inexpensive.
924. I've only been taking these for a few days now.  I have noticed that I'm not doing my usual afternoon snacking.  Just don't want anything in the afternoon anymore.I do eat a light breakfast before I take the pills.It did take about 2 days before I started noticing my hunger going down a bit.If you can easily swallow pills then you'll have no problem with these.  If you have a gag reflex then these might be a little problem.  Pills are a little bit, in my opinion.Will try to do an update in a month.
925. I ordered several of these in different colors for review including the one in , and they are all junk and stick in place. All had to be thrown out.This black one is as terrible a pill case as the other colors. The door is difficult to open and the chamber was stuck on Saturday and a half. I cannot even use this; not to mention if I could I would not be able to see the pills. I threw this out. Avoid like the plague.
926. Sized for children or smaller adults, durable for the price.
927. These earplugs, recommended by the Wirecutter, have a lot of potential.  The design is functional and ascetically pleasing and there are several sizing options in both the rubber and foam tips, which is great.  I'm still working through the options to figure out what size is the best fit for my ears and I haven't landed on the perfect solution yet, but hopefully with all of the available options I should be able to find the right fit.  Given the variety, I'm sure most people would be able to find an option that works well for their ears, which is one of the nice benefits of this product over many of the competing options.
928. This TENS unit is by far the best! I have terrible chronic pain and not much at all has helped me, this helps me relax so much and gives me relief. Thank you so much for making this product! I HIGHLY recommend it. If you are looking for great quality and pain relief then this is your device!
929. Not just for kids. I love these. won't wipe my ass without them. they are fragrance free and not harsh at all. never have a problem with them flushing.
930. These are too big to provide any compression. I’ve also tried SBSox, Copper Compression and Roxofit, all ordered based on their individual sizing recommendations for my 8” arches. These by far fit the largest (in size small). They are designed more like the SBSox style which is longer and extends the length of the metatarsal region. This is good for people with longer feet. But these have a thick seem that looks like it would be uncomfortable too. I ordered these because they came in flesh tone, and had to return the copper compression flesh tone ones due to poor construction quality. But I can not recommend these and they are going back immediately without me even trying to wear them to see if they are supportive.
931. The locking mechanism gave way after first trip. Without it, it's just an expensive plastic bag. I will not buy this again.
932. Very heavy. I wouldn't wear these out of the house until I am able to keep them in for sure.
933. Very good price. Looks great,  the round shape is of good size.  Vision is clear, glasses look durable
934. This Cavalier matches the one I have in real life❤️  Holds my glasses so I can find them easily. It’s a good weight too. It really is a cute art piece!
935. packaged well, great item for the price.  arrived promptly.
936. Not bad but is slightly too low for me in lateral position. The customer support seems helpful though and suggested to try two pillows on top of each other. I will give it a try.
937. Use this in my bubble bars and it works great!
938. The gel is really refreshing.
939. I purchased these for the Charcoal bristle brushes, I received the package, there are white bristle brushes and Charcoal bristle brushes in the package, they all have different letters but they don't tell you if the letters stand for the different softness levels of the brushes or what they represent. The brushes loose their bristles after about the first 10 brushes so they're definitely disposable. I am keeping them for guests to use but not what I was hoping for.
940. The smell is a bit weird... however, I am so fond of the fact that it is a silky, lotion consistency and not a nasty, stinging oil ! This product is great, but you may wish to wash your hands after using it ! Or add a medicinal, therapeutic grade, quality, Organic, essential oil fragrance to it.... in order to mask the scent ! Over all though... I highly recommend the product. It works FAST !
941. I like these containers and they did NOT leak when I filled them with my hippy sunblock brew.  However, only four stars because this set doesn't really screw back down.
942. I didn't like the taste of this at all, and ended up giving it away.
943. Nice on nose
944. I found these in my local grocer's, used them, and fell in love. I understand the negative reviews, since in today's society faster and simpler is deemed better, but I believe in working at least a little harder if you want the best results in any area of our lives. The glue flap requires attention and care to close it properly, and the results are excellent. I just bought out one supplier here at Amazon, and I'll be looking for more. I love this Quickasteam product, and I thank the inventors and manufacturers who have made my dinnertimes much faster, safer, and more delicious.
945. I've been watching a lot of Kdramas lately and the characters often take these supplements in small pouches.  I was interested in trying this calcium jelly supplement.  The calcium supplement is expensive at around $2 per pouch but it is much tastier than the large calcium pills that I normally take.  The supplement is a mix of jelly and fruit leather texture and has a sweet pomegranate taste.  The supplement doesn't have sugar or water but it has a nice light burnt sugarcaramel and pomegranate taste.
946. Don't be afraid to switch hands if one eye's application gives you more trouble than the other.
947. PROS1. Plenty of different strains of beneficial bacteria in adequate amounts.CONS1. These supplements do not have an enteric coating in order to allow the probiotic bacteria to reach the colon alive.2. This product is not listed on the company’s website, though it is promoted on their Facebook page.3. Intestinal Fortitude (IF) was founded about eight years ago in Williamsburg, Virginia. It is a very small company whose supplements, including this one, are undoubtedly produced by a much larger company, which specializes in manufacturing supplements. Unfortunately, IF has not openly disclosed on its website the name of the manufacturer of its products, including this one.4. IF states on its website that their ingredients are sourced from around the world, though their supplements are bottled in the USA.
948. I wore these to work hoping they would provide my left ankle with the bracing it needs as I suffer from an old tendon tear that flares up when I do a great deal of walking andor when the weather is extremely hot (or if there is a quick shift in the weather).  I tore the tendon that runs along the outside of my left foot - and when I say tore, I literally heard a CRACK when it tore.  It was so loud and such a "crisp" sound, I thought I'd broken a bone.  Anyway, it took a very long time to heal and because it is a tendon, it did not heal back "the same as new."  It hurts and feels as if it could give way when the weather is muggy hot and when I've walked quite a bit.  I mention this because that's why I ordered this "brace" for my left ankle.  And again, I wore these to work and while they are like wearing compression socks which are better than nothing on my foot, they have to bracing effect.  I even had kinseology tape wrapped around that ankle as well.  Ah well.  Short compression socks with my toes free are fine.
949. Most ultra healthy foodstuffs do not taste good. This powder is OK mainly because it blends in with whatever you choose to mix it with, like tofu. It is bland on its own but it's fairly tasty when mixed with something else. I appreciate the fact that it's organic and non-GMO, but this is one of these superfood powders that best benefit those who don't eat enough fruits and vegetables. I do, so I don't feel I'm missing that much by not ingesting something with Noni fruit in it. It's OK but I wouldn't order it again.
950. and this wonderful stuff prevents rashes, sores, redness from her diaper undies. I love that it has no petrol chemicals or other toxic garbage. I thank GOD for the Honest company.
951. These are well flavored drops.  I used it for vape juice flavoring and my husband enjoyed the flavor and had no complaints.
952. I had high hopes for this product, but alas I was dissatisfied. I found it necessary to reapply the product every 45-60 minutes. I would not repurchase this product.
953. This Hibiclens Hand Pump took a ridiculously long time to arrive and the straw does not reach the bottom of the bottle. While I was waiting for this to arrive I purchased two clear  pump dispenser bottles which arrived the following day. They take up less space than a 32oz bottle, cost less, and are a more attractive option. Save your money!
954. I nice love them
955. This has a very weird taste I like the chocolate and vanilla. The company itself was great
956. Seller is advertising product as easy to swallow. They are NOT. These capsules are almost an inch long and about 1.25 inches in circumference. They are among the largest, if not the largest, capsules I have come across so I measured them. Many older people have trouble swallowing and these could very well be dangerous for them. I have a smallish throat so I bought these believing the &#34;easy to swallow&#34; advertising, which I find deceiving. Will not purchase again.
957. Marine collagen was better for me
958. I chose this because it is a DK combo and encapsulated in fat. Here is why ==>  K helps you absorb the D and both D & K are fat soluble vitamins.  For about a year now we have been using DK combos in our bulletproof coffee in the morning. (more fat for absorption)  Both my husband and I have had our D checked and we are both slightly over 100.  With the present climate, one wants to be over 75.  If one has an auto-immune, one wants to be as close to 100 without going over.  When I first started last year I was tested at 41.  Which is normal, but not high enough for certain things.  That was considering, I already took a standard D supplement and we were very much outdoorsy people.  Most people just do not not realize they are deficient.So ... all that said ... I appreciate this product.  We still use it in our coffee.  It seems to work well and keeps out levels where we need.  We have gotten our D checked about every 6 months.  No regrets here.
959. Fantastic product.  I have never had anything work faster or better.
960. Very good shisha. First time trying fantasia. Love it, especially the rainbow flavor
961. I'VE BEEN THROUGH SEVERAL NEBULIZERS NOW. THIS IS THE BEST, SO FAR...COMPLETELY SILENT, WORKS GREAT...I LOVE IT...
962. I was looking a pair of Calf Compression Sleeves for my running sessions and these ones are great. I'd buy them again
963. This set of dental tools comes in a metal case and includes six different tools. Four of the six are scraping or pick tools, one is a mirror, and the other a large tweezers. I’m not a dentist or hygienist and honestly I have no idea what to do with several of these tools, including the tweezers??, but the scraping tools work very well for my intended purpose which is to clean my teeth between dentist visits. I don’t like the feel of plaque and tartar building up on my lower front teeth, and with these tools, I can gently remove some of it to keep my teeth feeling clean and healthy. The tools are weighty, made of quality stainless steel, and for a non-professional like me, are perfect, especially given the low price.
964. My dentist introduced me to this line of products some years back, and I had been using the mouthwash and the oral irrigation rinse for use with my water pic ever since then, but had never tried the breath spray or the toothpaste. I also recently went on a vacation where I was not able to bring my mouthwash, and I had really missed it.This was a wonderful way to get introduced to the other products in the line that I hadn't yet tried, and to have some travel products available for the next time I go on vacation so that I don't have to do without.The packaging is excellent and seems very sturdy, yet it's easy to get into when I want to use. And I really like the breath spray, which seems to actually neutralize issues rather than just cover them up with a squirt of mint.
965. Don't Go without it!
966. This stuff works great on left on forever grease messes by the stove.
967. I used Crest for many, many years.  I was getting tired of it, even though it is just toothpaste.  I switched to Colgate a few years ago, and I find the taste is pleasant.  The only issue is I think the tubes have really shrunk throughout the years.
968. I bought this because I have arthritis in my right thumb, and it hurts to use a regular fingernail clipper.  I can effortlessly cup my nails.  It's such a relief!  The only thing I didn't like is the size of the cutting mechanism.  It's a little large.  It's better suited  for clipping toenails than fingernails.
969. I ordered this for my grandpa who moves around the house in his wheelchair. This was great for transition in floor from hallway to kitchen as he had trouble moving on the threshold. We liked it so much we are ordering another one for another area in the house.
970. I used the whole bottle and didn't notice any change.
971. I have owned many different pill cutters over the years, and this is the best one I’ve ever used, by far. It is constructed of medical-grade, BPA-free plastic, and its stainless-steel blade is thin and sharp. This allows it to cut pills in half without turning them into crumbs and dust, which happens all too often when such blades are too wide and too dull.It is typical for pill cutters to have a V-shape for holding pills of various sizes in place, so that is not in itself a unique feature. However, what is a new feature, to me at least, is that this pill cutter provides a highly visible, painted line running down the center of the V space. This mark allows the user to accurately position pills which contain an indented, break line in their center, such that this break line is in alignment with the cutter’s blade. This makes it additionally likely that this particular type of pill will be split cleanly in half, with no wasted crumbs.This pill cutter is conveniently larger than any other pill cutter I’ve owned, which are usually about 1-inch x 2.5-inch in size. This one is 1.5-inch x 3.5-inch, making it easier to handle for anyone who suffers from arthritis.Finally, as an extra little plus, this handy device is surprisingly attractive due to its sleek design and the fact that it is a pleasing, aqua color.All in all, I find this to be an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend to family or friends.
972.  I got this for my toddler who sometimes have a hard time to self sooth  at bedtime. This ball has a vibrating  press button that is removable it uses a battery (it doesn't  come with one) thou my baby is not fond of the vibration so I took it out. We have been using it and he has been doing excellent  at bedtime, I like it.I will suggest  removing  the vibrating  button if you are not using it, because  it's heavy and if you have more than one kid using it as a play throw ball you don't want the vibrating  button  hitting  your kids it's painful.
973. Anyone doing cancer therapy should drink this. Seriously! Check out their site on-line.
974. Did not fit the Pedegg model I have. The value and quality was great, but sadly I had to return them.
975. Works ok.Could get the same product for cheaper price
976. This gat to be one of my favorites product for babies. It's easy to use and definitely gets the nasal passages open for baby. I recommend it
977. I remembered this alcohol scent from when I was a kid. Our home was filled with extra stuff, too much to fit in a medicine cabinet so this was on the 3 tier shelf just outside the bathroom. This was a different alcohol with a great scent. Years later I found it again in a beauty supply store and still loved it and used it like I did regular alcohol. I'd also apply to my underarms, instead of deodorant, when I'd be home to help keep me smelling fresh and feeling cool.
978. just what i wanted
979. I purchased this as a gift for my daughter...she loves it and says it works great!!!
980. maybe it's just me but this makes a thick layer on the nails. In one respect it's good because I don't have to soak it off. Instead it peals off in one piece and doesn't last more than a day or two BUT since I'm not paying 60.00 a pop to do my own nails I can't really complain. You get what you pay for.
981. This cushion is great and is made out of the same great material developed by Purple for their Purple Bed. I recommend their cushion as much as I recommend their bed.This cushion measures 18&#34;x16&#34;. It is perfect for smaller chairs in the kitchen or smaller computer chairs. I personally am using mine in my car (Dodge Durango) for comfort. I find that is is quite comfortable but I wish it was a little bit bigger. I would recommend if you are using this for a bigger computer chair or vehicle seat, get the cushion that is the next size up which would be The Ultimate Purple Cushion.Dimensions are 18&#34;x16&#34;x2&#34; inside of the included washable cover.Pros:*Really comfortable for 4-8 hours of sitting*Doesn't smell*Included coverCons:*Kind of small, made more for smaller chairs (-12 a star)Additional Considerations:Take a look at the purple bed and the other cushions they are great. They also have a new kickstarter out for their purple pillow which I expect will also be great.Overall: 4.55 stars (&#62;=.5 rounds up, &#60;.5 rounds down) =&#62; 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
982. These are made for the Dallas Cowboy fan, but the star logo is a pretty design for a ziploc bag even if you're not a fan. Ziploc bags are so versatile - I use these to take snacks to work, for freezing leftovers and as a disposable "shake and bake" bag (just fill one with breadcrumbs and dump your egg-soaked pork chop or chicken leg, shake, then put the meat in the oven). Each bag is easy to seal and it's hard to tear - the bags are neither too thick nor too thin, which makes them ideal for storing food items. Overall I'm happy with it.
983. This is very similar to every other collagen powder I have tried, but it does have a hard time mixing in.
984. Easier to put on. Once on your feet get so hot I couldn't tolerate then and had to take them off a couple hours after putting them on
985. By far, out of SO many masks I’ve purchased, the best mask ever. I don’t have an exceptionally large face but most others, aside from the paper masks, leaves my double chin (!) so obvious. This tucks under, goes high, has the metal piece for the bridge of the nose and allows you to unfold as much or little as you want. Expensive but so worth it!
986. I’ve bought others but this one fits hand better when applying vs those that feel like they are size of baseball mitt
987. Took it once and made me very sick. Yuck! And no returns.
988. They work awesome. DOESN'T PULL ON YOUR NOSE HAIRS LIKE SOME TRIMMERS.
989. great bath pillow. never had any issues with suction cups like with previous pillows.  it's lasted for a few years and still going strong.
990. I purchased 4 of these from amazon after I purchased one for our 4 month old at a boutique and our big kids fell in love with them and begged me to get them each one!! We have the pink, purple, tealgreen, tealblue, and the orangeyellow! They are all so cute and feel so good!! Also they work great for cradle cap!
991. Very little product. Not worth what I paid.
992. I know pure coconut milk tends to clump, but I would rather have clumping than have other ingredients included to prevent clumping. My body doesn't like the starches added. It adulterates the taste as well.
993. I used it once, and it worked fine. I stored it outside in a storage bench, and the next time I pulled it out, the dustpan was completely warped and no longer usable. What a waste. It was brand new!!
994. No batteries to worry about!
995. Love these Elderberry gummies. Whatever I can do to help my immune system during this pandemic is a plus. The taste is pleasant. Vegetarian and GMO free is also a plus.
996. Too super long for it to arrive.  I guess because it came directly from China.  The case itself is OK.  Its not a solid hard case.  It has the strength of let's say, a shoe box that has been covered with material.
997. Keeping screens, glasses, and face shields is a never ending chore.These wipes do a through job without leaving streaks or film.So nice not to have to go back and try to polish again!
998. Very nice little organizer, a bit bigger than I needed since I don't wear a lot of jewelry, but will help me make sure my jewelry doesn't get lost in the bottom of my bag when I travel.
999. This stuff is hot folks. We were used to the regular green stuff and the max freeze. This "pro-mix"has a lot of menthol in it. My physical therapist recommended cutting it with some good lotion. We did and it works great. You can make 2 tubes out of one. If you can stand it right out of the tube, you are much tougher than we are, lol!
1000. Hard to tell if it's actually working, but from ask appearances it's keeping my bathroom air clean of germs and mold spores! It at least does a decent job of eliminating odors, I think. And it's a comforting presence, to know it's always whirring away!
