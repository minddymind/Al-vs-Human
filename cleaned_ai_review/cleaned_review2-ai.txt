these are fantastic gift options the lavender scent is delightful and the bath bombs are a good size they last a while and transform your bath into a calming spa experience the little lavender buds on top are a lovely touch

i used this after the cake foaming cleanser the powder didnt come out as easily as expected but once i rubbed it in it left my toy clean and soft the ingredients are simple cornstarch but considering the price it feels a bit overpriced still it works well
this product feels a bit awkward to use especially with my larger shower head its helpful for my shower bench but positioning the shower head in the holder can be challenging it would work better with a smaller or mediumsized shower head

i found these corneacare rescue eye cooling pads very effective for dry and puffy eyes caused by allergies i prefer cooling them in the fridge before use and they provide great relief
i bought these contact cases because of the design and the tools included allowing me to see my contacts through the lid however to my surprise they are not leakproof
these tennis shoes caused pain in my toes after long walks especially my second toe im overweight and initially thought it was due to that however i noticed the pain didnt occur with other shoes these insoles have worked well to alleviate the discomfort and ill be more careful when purchasing my next pair of walking shoes
i keep these in each room so i can turn off the lights without having to get up its so convenient especially when my hands are full
this is exactly what i needed to compensate for my slight leg length discrepancy as recommended by my doctor its perfect and the shipping was incredibly fast very pleased with my purchase
these gel inserts are a lifesaver for my foot problems including heel spurs and plantar fasciitis i avoid heels due to back issues so flats are my goto i swap these inserts between different shoes and they make a huge difference at 599 for two pairs its a great deal
i thought it would be like the one i had years ago but it didnt meet my expectations while it worked to some extent it wasnt sticky and wasnt quite what i was hoping for so i returned it
i used this to clean outdoor furniture cushions and it worked wonderfully i plan to purchase it again
the flavor is chocolatey but not like chocolate milk which i dislike it reminds me of the inside of a 3 musketeers bar  thick chocolatey and satisfying its filling and can be thinned with water or milk or blended with ice for a milkshakelike treat its not lowcalorie but offers a balanced nutritional profile including vitamins minerals and fiber its a great choice for a meal replacement especially on days when i dont feel like eating sweetened with allulose and sucralose its very sweet without an aftertaste its a versatile drink thats easy to add to smoothies im impressed and would definitely recommend it
my kids are usually very picky but they love these theyre not overpowering in flavor but theyre just tasty enough the sugarfree aspect is a huge plus and with health being so important im happy with these probiotics
good product but the price is wrong  i found it for just 95 cents at walmart

the urn is of very good quality with an easytoremove lid that stays secure the map design is beautiful though im confused about the alphabet across the top of the lid i had hoped it would be perfect for my brother a world traveler but im not sure about the alphabet everything else is as described though
excellent value for the price i even gave some away to fellow travelers during a recent cruise
these are not the 250 power reading glasses i expected theyre missing the size on the arm and seem defective with scratches and late delivery very disappointed with the quality control this time
i didnt realize this product would alter the structure of my soup turning it into something like jello which i didnt like at least the flavor remained unchanged
i love this loofah its especially great for getting rid of dry skin in the winter and the length works well for me im 58 it would fit a shorter person too
not sure how well it cleans my teeth but i love the taste of the splashin citrus its very flavorful and the natural ingredients like bentonite and citrus make it enjoyable the only downside is the frustration of trying to get the last bit of paste out of the plastic tube
a lot of ribbon
very cooling and soothing though almost too intense it provides instant relief
it does what its supposed to do
it provides a good boost of energy without the jitters lasting about 90 minutes
i absolutely love them ive ordered more and even gave some away they arrived just as ordered wellpackaged and have become an essential part of my daily routine due to my diabetes and upcoming gastric bypass surgery
i wanted to like this but it didnt work for me the elastic was heavy and the velcro closure was stiff and uncomfortable it also snagged the fabric the material was thin and not very absorbent i wouldnt recommend it especially for postshower warmth
i keep these in my toolbox around the shop and in my truck theyre handy for a variety of uses hold a good edge and can cut through materials like webbing fabric thin metal and even wire
im thrilled with the results from jigsaw health magnesium wsrt its lowered my blood pressure by 40 points and normalized my blood sugar levels my doctor may take me off my prescription if these results continue
just what i was looking for the extras are a nice touch and the box appears to be wellmade
the product didnt meet my expectations
these are great for keeping pairs of socks together and reducing sorting time theyve held up well for about six months so im happy with my purchase and even bought more
it creates a foamy lather quickly and the bristles are holding up well the only issue is that the handle is a bit wide for my hands but overall im satisfied with the product
the scent is perfect  better than axe and the reviews were spot on its hard to go wrong with a brand thats been around forever
ive had trouble with various shoes in the past but these inserts didnt meet my needs there were no guidelines for cutting them and they felt stiff and rough i wouldnt purchase these again
i got this for my 13yearold grandson and he carries it with him all the time
delicious and nutritious these help me feel better while tasting great the pineapple flavor is just the right balance  not too overpowering
this is my fourth or fifth pair of sleep headphones and these are by far the most comfortable the eye padding and adjustable band are great the sound quality is fine though the speakers could be smaller overall i love them and the battery life is good too
i didnt notice any difference in stress relief with this product i even tried it on my dog but there was no effect maybe its just not strong enough for me or perhaps i couldnt feel a change due to my medications
these arrived in fine condition but the tegaderm boxes were damaged and they had a chemical smell i was told that returns werent accepted which was disappointing especially since i needed them for medication patches
these are great the quality of the glass files is apparent and im so glad i found them after trying several other brands
this didnt stay in place and was too large for me
a great way to add antioxidants to your food i prefer fresh but since acai berries arent easy to find this is the next best thing its versatile and easy to use in smoothies or yogurt
unfortunately this flavor contains milk which was disappointing however i will continue buying the cold brew coffee flavor which tastes great and is dairyfree
i couldnt wait to write this review i bought these gloves for my boyfriend who needed them for psoriasis treatment at night they fit perfectly and were very comfortable the ointment stayed on his fingers and knuckles providing relief ill be buying more for sure
perfect for packing light
this is the best moisturizer ive ever used my husband has severe psoriasis and this product brings him relief its thick but absorbs smoothly leaving my skin soft all day
these were too tight for me
best sleep aid ive tried
i received this product around 45 days ago the setup process was smooth and connecting it to the network and tracker was easy however i am experiencing inconsistent results despite following all the steps correctly such as placing it on a hard surface keeping the location unchanged and weighing myself with dry bare feet i still get varying results when i weigh myself multiple times in intervals of one minute my weight fluctuates by 05 to 1 pound and body fat percentages vary by 1 has anyone else encountered similar issues
i enjoy trying different protein flavors to break away from the usual vanilla the piña colada flavor has quickly become a new favorite it strikes the perfect balance not being too sweet or artificial my preferred way to enjoy it is mixed with plain greek yogurt i blend in half to a full scoop and let it chill for a bit before eating this way it completely masks the taste of the whey powder leaving a sweet and highprotein lowsugar treat it dissolves easily in both yogurt and milk for shakes i didnt experience any bloating or digestive discomfort highly recommended for anyone looking to try a new flavor
it seems to be working well for my dry brittle hair
this product is fantastic its very durable and the blades are sharp enough to cut through effortlessly a definite upgrade from the cheap flimsy clippers ive used in the past
a great aid postfoot surgery definitely makes a noticeable difference
this first aid kit is excellent it includes 250 items which is more than enough to care for my family in the event of an accident while i hope we never need it its reassuring to know that it has everything and then some the kit is compact wellorganized and easy to carry it has a variety of supplies making it suitable for many different scenarios im glad i found and purchased this kit for my family i bought it at a discounted price and am providing an honest review
works perfectly and is more affordable than similar products at walmart
amazing product very satisfied with my purchase
good quality product but the mattress is a bit firmer than i prefer so ill be returning it
adheres well even on greasy surfaces
part of my daily routine for knee pain relief just as expected
fits perfectly and its heatresistantno issues handling hot items
this case is a clever design it includes dividers to keep items separated which prevents jewelry like chains and earrings from tangling however the thickness from the dividers is noticeable its wellmade but i think someone will soon create a more compact organizer that still keeps items separate i also wish it came in more vibrant colorssomething like neon green would make it easier to spot in a hotel safe or on a dresser i rely on reviews for smart purchases and aim to help others with my feedback if this was helpful let me know by voting thanks
all formulas are easy to use unlike other pens these arent overnight ones so youll need to time and remember when you start while the results arent dramatic they are noticeable which is still great
very soft and holds up well through multiple washes
this product is a lifesaver i used to spend 100 on acupressure spa visits for neck pain relief after using this for the first time i was nearly brought to tears because it felt so effective it targets sore spots precisely and the heat feature adds extra comfort my only minor suggestion would be for the handles to be loops for easier adjustment between neck and back areas the construction is excellent with solid stitching and a pleasant red glow for the price its an incredible value and has significantly reduced my neck pain i use it before bed and my neck feels much better in the morning i just wish i had purchased this sooner
this product is large but stands well on its own it has colorful lights that you can turn off while sleeping and it offers multiple air cleaning levels it seems to work well and is easy to clean
this stain remover is unique with a deodorantstick style applicator ive used it on paint and fruit stains with great results its easy to apply just rub it on let it sit for 15 minutes and then wash the scent is fresh but not overpowering and its great for sensitive skin i appreciate that its biodegradable and chemicalfree
i use this product after removing my makeup with a rechargeable facial tool its gentle has a clean scent and doesnt strip my skin of natural oils great value for the price
i use this product daily
it has a lovely scent and is safe for my son who suffers from severe eczema people often compliment the smell of our clothes thanks to this product and the dryer spray from method
this is a fantastic product
perfect for the baby
other brands especially the menthol ones are harsh and have a burning effect 4way however works much better acting quickly and with minimal rebound its superior to other brands like the popular one with oxymetazoline hcl always check your labels
this product includes numerous tiny brushes
