let me start by saying that the packaging for this energy supplement is super cute which initially drew me in the name cherry bomb made me think the flavor would be great but once i opened it and smelled it i was completely turned off it had a strange strong scent that i couldnt even describe i braved a taste and regretted it immediately  it tasted like battery acid and stomach bile despite my hesitation i drank half the bottle out of thirst but i couldnt handle it the taste lingered and it was worse than i could imagine i wouldnt recommend this to anyone
what a great presentation for a gift however i eat mostly vegan and dont need to lose weight so this doesnt quite suit my needs mct oil is healthy and i use it in my salads with plenty of seasonings its tasteless so many people use it in coffee or tea i dont drink coffee but occasionally put it in smoothies although i think smoothies are a waste since they lack fiber this mct oil is fine in that context its pricey but the packaging is elegant and resembles a bottle of vodka
these are poorly made the sleeve doesnt stay in place and the foam inside is uncomfortable theres no cover on the foam and i cant believe these have received good reviews id recommend something like futuro which works much better for my ulnar nerve issues
im happy with this product i dislike bulky vitamins and remembering how many to take this powder is fine flavorless and easily mixes with shakes yogurt or oatmeal my only issue is that the resealable bag doesnt close well so i transferred it to a different container otherwise its a convenient way to add nutrients to my diet
my husband and i use this product to relax and help with sleep it works well and well be ordering again
this is the third time ive purchased this product but the sticks inside the bottle werent working the sticks in the pouch worked fine but unfortunately 100 sticks in the bottle were useless upon opening

i use this to make magnesium oil i mix it with water in a ratio of 1 part water to 12 parts flakes if you want it stronger you can use equal parts its best to store in a spray bottle and it can also be used as a deodorant
very cheesy and crunchy which makes it hard to stop eating once i start
it arrived on time a nice product with a clean scent
good quality and as advertised

the jade facial tools i received match the online photos but the scraper and roller are significantly different in color the scraper is polished and comfortable to use but the roller is noisy because it lacks silicone plugs inside the cylinders it still provides adequate pressure but the clunking sound is distracting at this price point its a good option for someone new to these tools but the color mismatch is a bit offputting

after surgery i couldnt sleep with pillows over my head so i tried this luxury silk sleep mask both my wife and i love it as it comfortably fits our different head sizes the material is soft and cool though my wife found it a bit warm after a while we both appreciate the way it blocks out light and softens surrounding sounds improving sleep quality the velcro is secure and it has a nice feminine look

these bulbs emit a cooler brighter light compared to standard soft white bulbs enhancing readability they are compact and have a quick turnon time however the packaging is flimsy and both the original and replacement shipments had a broken bulb these bulbs contain mercury so they should be ordered separately to avoid potential contamination from damage during shipping

this set includes 12 individually wrapped bath bombs with various fragrances such as orange lavender frankincense rosemary mint lemongrass vanilla seasalt kiwi rose coconut and papaya i tried the papaya scent upon dropping it in the water it fizzed out quickly without any noticeable suds and the fragrance was barely detectable despite smelling nice in the package the color stained my skin and towels but didnt affect the foot bath itself these bombs underperformed and at 1999 theyre not worth the price
i purchased these noodles online and was pleasantly surprised when my husband and son liked them even though they are used to more traditional pasta the noodles have a thin texture absorb the sauce well and dont take on its flavor as much as other noodles like shiritaki each bag contains four servings and they are high in fiber making them a good option for a healthy meal
for 11 its decent though i didnt use the adhesive it came with since it seemed unreliable instead i used regular doublesided tape which worked much better and saved time
i appreciate the kf94 masks for their comfortable fit especially since they suit my petite face well the ear loops are smaller than most which helps achieve a snug fit however the vshaped cutout at the top of the mask doesnt work as intended for me as it creates gaps on the sides allowing air to enter overall these masks are good for my needs but might not be ideal for larger faces

these are ineffective they dont fly at all and barely spin even when an adult tries to make them work so i cant see how they would be enjoyable for a child
due to health concerns i need to ensure im getting enough protein and this product has been a fantastic addition ive made a frozen mixture that i keep on hand and it boosts both the protein content and the flavor its now one of my favorites
im really enjoying the twixflavored protein the collagen powder adds a smooth texture though youll need a blender for best results the flavor is satisfying on its own but adding a bit of banana or peanut butter can make it feel more like a milkshake either way i think youll find it delicious

i was excited about the roségold eyelash curler but it arrived in a cheap plastic box that was bent the product didnt look as highquality as the picture and i was disappointed with it
so to start i understand that isnt the most conventional use for the product but it really works the first picture is the start of my shingles flareup my dad typically uses this product for joint pain but he suggested that i use this on the shingles i got it quickly from amazon and slathered a thick layer of the gel onto the painful liquidfilled blisters and bumps i will admit that upon application it burns and tingles but not so bad that its unbearable after a few days the blisters started to dry out a good thing for shingles because it means its healing and after about a week of application to the area the blisters dropped considerably in size and the bumps were almost completely gone i will admit as others have that the only drawback i could see is that it is very drying i noticed that the skin around the bumps and blisters got flaky and dried out i wanted this product to dry the blisters so just be wary if youre using it for pain relief etc
this did things to an old rug i thought not remotely possible  including not animalrelated spots i extremely highly recommend
this weighted pencil holder is not a bad product the grip on it is large so if your kid is more comfortable with a bigger pencil to grip its got that covered the outer portion isnt squishy its sort of a sandy grip which isnt a bad thing either the trouble is that you need to attach this using a tiny allen wrench to tension the grip onto the pencil which means that you have to have the wrench out every time the pencil needs sharpening my boys mash their pencils into the paper resulting in many broken pencil tips the allen wrench never gets put away greatly increasing the likelihood that itll be lost there has to be a better way to make this grip adhere to the pencil but other than that its a great device for helping kids that need this kind of aid be advised this listing was not for the kit i only purchased as per the listing the deluxe grip third from the top its a bit pricey for what you get and ive found a better option so you might want to see if you can find this locally so you can have a look at it before you buy

no complaints about the formulation of this probiotic it hits the mark for both potency 25 billion cfus and strain diversity a total of 10 strains 8 lactobacillus and 2 bifidobacterium strains the specific strains are listed on the bottle but not the specific concentration of each it delivers the 25 billion cfus with a serving size of only 1 capsule 2 caps are the more common situation making this bottle of 30 caps a months supply the downside is the price there are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same or sometimes better potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a months supply while the formulation is solid the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars average equally good options are available that are a much better value

i have trouble sleeping and magnesium seems to help this package of individually packaged doses makes it easy to consume magnesium in liquid versus tablet or capsule form it has the potential to be more potent as it gets into your bloodstream more quickly i also like the taste a bit sweet while i appreciate the convenience of having each dose premeasured for me the doses come in these small plastic vials to get out the entire liquid i found myself biting down on the plastic vial itself as if it were candy and indeed these vials remind me of the candy soda pop vials that kids swilled by biting off the wax top and then drinking the sugary liquid inside its kind of wasteful but i cant deny theyre convenient great for travel but not great for the environment
