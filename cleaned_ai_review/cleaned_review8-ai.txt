i love these bags theyre sparkly with three types of glittersilver gold and rose gold the material is sturdier than typical gift bags and designed for reuse making them more environmentally friendly theyre small though so theyre better suited for swag bags or small gifts like jewelry the thank you tags are a nice touch but it would have been nice to have other tag options such as happy birthday or seasons greetings overall theyre great for gifting

at 999 this product offers great value the mask alone justifies the price however if the price were over 1299 i would rate it lower due to the included extras the sleep mask is incredibly soft and blocks out light very well thanks to its eye sockets and adjustable strap unfortunately the eye shade is uncomfortable and ineffective at blocking light and the earplugs are poor quality i would prefer just the mask for the price

i was eager to try this supplement for immunity especially during the winter months the pill size is standard and easy to swallow with no issues of upset stomach or burping however the bottle only lasts 10 days if taken as recommended which can be quite expensive at 20 per bottle at the full dosage youd be looking at 60 per month which might not be worth it while it did help me feel better at a reduced dosage i would caution against taking it as prescribed

i was never particularly into vitamins aside from the occasional multivitamin however during the pandemic i began a daily routine of taking vitamin c vitamin d3 and zinc every morning along with an additional vitamin c dose at night this large bottle contains 300 tablets which should last me three months i usually take all my vitamins on an empty stomach and so far i havent experienced any negative side effects i believe everyone should incorporate these into their daily regimen to boost the immune system even if vaccinated highly recommended
i purchased the germguardian to tackle the smell from the kitty litter box which is located in the spare bedrooms bathroom for a long time i struggled to control the odor but this unit has completely solved the issue ive been running it 247 and it eliminates the smell entirely the spare bedroom is now the freshest room in the house i plan to get a couple more ive only had it for about a week so i cant comment on its longterm reliability but im hopeful it will last
these sponges work really well for their price they exfoliate just the right amountnot too gentle not too harshand lather nicely they dont last too long but at this price you get what you pay for which is why there are four in the pack

the sponge heads from the store tend to leak like crazy due to a hole in the middle but these ones dont they last about a month with frequent use while thats a bit shorter than expected i love them and will definitely buy them again
these are super cute come with long sticks and work really well great value for the price with three boxes
my husband wears these every night to bed
this has a lovely cherry almond scent the moment i opened the box i immediately recognized it the lotion absorbs instantly without leaving greasy hands which i really appreciate i use it on my dry skin from wearing a knee brace all day and it makes a huge difference the pump works well and the scent lingers lightly throughout the day especially if i sweat it reminds me a lot of aveeno which i used for years but this is a great more affordable alternative
this package is a great value and will last quite a while
quick shipping i love this toothpaste though it can be hard to find sometimes i hope it stays in stock as i will definitely buy again
this mushroom supplement is one of the most affordable ones ive reviewed lately priced at 1499 i like the variety of mushrooms included especially chaga which is great for immune health although i cant say for sure how much chaga is in this supplement i purchase it separately in powder form for its health benefits overall im happy with this supplement
this product is excellent

this hatteker mens electric shaver is perfect for travel its compact lightweight and fits easily into carryon luggage or a weekend bag the accessories include a charger and a small cleaning brush i wouldnt use it for everyday home use due to its small size but it delivers a sharp shave with minimal noise its a fun and practical travel companion
these reliable 1 laboratories dissolve in your mouth before you can even take a sip of water it took me three swallows to wash down the grit they have no taste which is nice but im unsure if they actually contain any omeprazole
i returned this item because there was almost no fragrance the automatic spray mechanism works well but the wax itself didnt meet expectations
these elderberry gummies are now one of my favorites they taste great but what i really like is that they include propolis echinacea and vitamin c without any added zinc which is nice since so many other supplements contain it these gummies pack about twice the amount of elderberry as other brands and ive noticed a big difference in my immunityhavent been sick at all this cold and flu season
i broke my first aromyst diffuser by dropping it i liked it so much that i bought another one instead of trying a different brand the black design is sleek and i like the options for continuous or intermittent mist i use it every few days and still enjoy it
this product wasnt what i expected if the information about ormus is correct it should come in an electromagnetically sealed container which it didnt under a microscope i saw little yellow bits that i assume are the gold content but im not sure if this would work as intended i wish i had spent my money on something more effective like vitamins
this is my second time ordering these vitamins they were recommended by an herbalist im working with i appreciate that they are plantbased ive noticed improvements in my body balance almost immediately my days are much more stable now very pleased

this product uses all the product without absorbing it which takes a bit more patience and blending but i love it i dont feel dirty after using it
these cotton swabs are perfect for me due to cauliflower ear they work very well for my needs
the package was slightly damaged but the colognes inside were intact
this lotion has a smooth texture and doesnt have any noticeable scent which works well for my 34yearold skin while its not quite the same as foundation it could function similarly to a bb cream it doesnt seem to be waterproof and it tends to run slightly if i sweat a lot but this is a common issue with such creams overall i would recommend it im mediumfair in skin tone and the light shade works fine for me
i absolutely loved these wipes i bought a 160pack two years ago and im just now needing more unfortunately the company that made them is no longer around ill try kimwipes as a replacement but these disposable microfiber wipes were amazing for cleaning my glasses
the silicone is too slippery to effectively hold soap if you try using it to scrub your back its too soft to exfoliate properly it feels more like youre slapping a rubbery surface against your back and it makes a lot of noise you can even hear it from another room
i really love this product  it definitely works as promised
these are smaller than i expected i had to attach both pieces together to fit around my leg the compression seems minimal as well

my sister uses this to cushion her toes on her injured foot and she says it works really well i imagine it could be useful for other purposes too
i bought these for blessing bags and they were perfect for the task
this was an incredible deal i ended up with multiple types of dishwasher soaps stain removers gain laundry soap and a fullsize gain scent booster plus i got the full purchase price back in credit for other cleaning products well worth the money i highly recommend this box
i would rate this zero stars if possible this egg is terrible it makes a noise like a smoke detector siren and its poorly constructed with hot glue holding it together its not safe to hide anything inside my visually impaired daughter was scared of it i would suggest the talking or chirping eggs from other sellers on amazon instead and the price is outrageous
i really like these face mask lanyards theyre perfect for attaching your mask to and you can easily hang it around your neck when youre not using it no more leaving your mask on the desk or worrying about where to put it when eating or driving you also get four lanyards in this pack which makes it very convenient although theyre on the pricier side theyre definitely a handy solution
great price and improved focus im satisfied with this product
these capsules are much better than others ive used they close properly every time and ive never had one fall apart unlike other capsules that spilled everywhere
im returning this product because it doesnt seem to repel anything insects are still coming in so it didnt work as expected
i really love the presentation of this product its perfect as a gift the scents are nice and not overpowering when dissolved in the bath and my bathwater was vibrant without any staining im looking forward to using the rest
the canister looks great on my counter which is important to me the product inside provides a good 20g of protein but the chocolate flavor is a bit ruined by the excess monk fruit extract some people might like the sweetness but id prefer a more natural sweetener like organic sugar overall it makes a nice hot cocoa and i like the lack of plastic scoops and clear labeling
its useful for treating minor cuts a good item to have on hand for such purposes
this floss tears easily especially if you try to reuse it by washing not great for that purpose
ive had this table for a couple of years and while it has some issues like sagging towards the center and one leg slipping its lightweight easy to clean and versatile the lip around the edge keeps items from sliding off and its easy to move around when needed
nowhere in the product description does it mention that its made in china which i find problematic amazon should be more transparent about where their products come from
i love this set the artwork is great and the clipper is amazing as always
the reishi mushroom powder gives me an energy boost its a bit bitter but i can tolerate it when mixed with coffee im willing to put up with the bitterness for the health benefits
i really like these clippers but i wish they had a metal bit to clean under the nails the catcher works well though it can slide around depending on how you hold the clippers its a good medium size and cuts well
these are great the 510 threading is perfectly done and they fit almost any rda or rta the base is useful for building or storing an atty i appreciate that these are priced reasonably and i recommend them for any vaper
the flavor is great and it mixes really well if you prefer protein supplements that arent too sweet this is a great option
 free product given for evaluation  review  this is a good quality amber glass bottle of pure moroccan rosewater the amber glass helps preserve it longer while the scent is a bit stronger than other brands ive used its still pleasant the spray feels a little heavier on my skin but it makes it feel soft compared to other rosewaters this one is slightly less delicate but its still a good option for toning
this battery was supposed to work for my waterpik sr 3000 toothbrush but even after replacing it the toothbrush didnt respond despite soldering the leads correctly the device wouldnt charge properly after 24 hours replacing the battery didnt solve the issue
these pads are fantastic for removing tough residue on cookware and soap scum in the shower they also work great on palm marks on banisters they wear out quickly but theyre the best ive found for cleaning almost any surface
i like these plugs for their discreetness and effectiveness they help reduce ambient noise making it easier to hear speech for the price theyre a great investment if you dont already have good earplugs id recommend investing in a decent pair
this product arrived quickly ive been taking it as a precaution against glaucoma since it runs in my family along with diabetes it seems beneficial so i plan to continue using it and would likely purchase more once the free supply runs out
these dryer sheets are great they dont have an overpowering scent and clean well theyre also easy to use just like traditional dryer sheets but i appreciate that they come in a smaller more environmentally friendly package
these didnt fit my glasses properly
its a cute idea but when i received it some of the letters were coming off additionally some of the letters were straight while others were crooked which was frustrating ill try to fix them but id prefer not to have to repair something i bought
this is a great small tablet thats easy to swallow and doesnt leave a nasty aftertaste its a nice addition to my vitamin regimen and i will continue purchasing it
this product is great for spring cleaning or major cleaning tasks it holds up well and is a better deal compared to other similar products it hasnt been perfect for mold but its still impressive overall
the zip lock works well and ill be buying more
it works well enough i bought it so i could vape in the car without annoying my wife mission accomplished
these essential oils have the most beautiful natural smells just a couple of drops in my diffuser and it works wonderfully
the blue color is darker than expected but it still works well for my glasses it seems to be wellmade
this is a great invention and i hope it lasts
these pain relief patches really heat up as promised
these files are more suited for buffing rather than fine sanding they perform effectively for buffing purposes but may not be as effective when it comes to shaping
the product doesnt seem as durable or robust as the original tv version it loses its shape more quickly though its priced well the original lasts much longer these will still be useful for a while and help with plantar fasciitis however ill likely stick with the originals moving forward if the original height is too much for you these could be a suitable alternative it seems like a different filler material in the pad id give the originals a solid 5 stars but these are more of a 4
the medium size worked well for my smaller arm its good quality and appears to be durable for the best results its best to use it ahead of time
i gifted this to my boyfriend as part of a beard grooming kit for christmas and hes absolutely thrilled he uses it every day with the beard balm i bought and his beard feels incredibly soft its been a huge improvement he enjoys the sensation and brushes his beard while we watch tv finding it very relaxing
the scrubby side is incredibly soft and my cats absolutely love it on their delicate faces and necks especially my older cat
my first experience with this product left my mouth feeling fresh and clean the mint flavor is mild and pleasant with no burning sensations in my mouth or lips the gel is thick and i had to squeeze the tube a bit harder than usual but after brushing for about two minutes and rinsing with just water my teeth felt bright and clean i appreciate that it doesnt leave a gritty aftertaste and it even brightened my teeth overall a great experience and i highly recommend it
great value for a 6pack  5 stars 
the product is of high quality but the pump mechanism broke at the top after the first use its still functional but less so the lotion itself is rich and emollient without being greasy it has a subtle apple scent that fades quickly
these lightweight summer socks dont bind at the top and look great with their ribbed design they stretch well making them perfect for people with edema or sensitive skin my dads caregivers asked me to order more for himive tried several other brands and materials and these are the best
this is very handy for cleaning between toes and it works well i hope they make a longer handle version in the future i bought three and recommend it
very quiet yet effective definitely worth buying
i really like these towels each roll contains 50 cloths with a total of 150 cloths across the three rolls the exterior design is festive starting the roll can be tricky because the first piece is glued tightly but once i get it off its smooth sailing i use them to clean counters or parts of my cats litter boxes theyre strong and reusable the price feels a bit high at 1799 1999 minus 10 off but if they last long and can be reused many times they may be worth it the current price comes to about 12 cents per sheet i would have given 5 stars if they werent so expensive but this might not be an issue for everyone
i use this to clean and massage my face and it works wonderfully i would definitely recommend it
this is the best product ive ever usedno exaggeration
ive been using these for over a year and at first i liked them however i began experiencing anxiety and shortness of breath which lasted about three months a few weeks ago i ran out of these vitamins and i didnt buy a new bottle since then my anxiety has significantly decreased i havent changed anything else so it seems the vitamins may have been the cause
great product i bought it for halloween and didnt need this much but for the price id definitely buy it again
this scent is nice and reasonably priced ive received compliments from men when i wear it and they often tell me i smell good its a great value and i like it
these worked great for my plant wall the three designs are cute but theyre not visible when a plant is inside the ring im using them indoors so i cant comment on their outdoor durability theyre easy to install and the rings are solid some of the hinges were a bit wobbly but it doesnt affect the sturdiness i didnt use the included wall anchors because they didnt seem very good i used drywall anchors i had from other projects instead which i highly recommend
the product is as described and comes with clear instructions on the packet its for onetime use and should be used immediately after opening
i dislike using the dustpan with a broom as i always have to move it around to catch all the debris this dustpan however is fantastic its on a long pole two short poles screwed together has a large capacity and allows me to get the debris into the trash without much spilling very happy with this purchase
bought this for my dad and he finds it easy to use
im glad i received the tissues quickly
this tea is delicious im not sure if it helped with my ibs but it tastes great the only issue is that it has a faint marijuana smell which is unusual for peppermint tea despite the strange smell its definitely worth it

previously bought this product
i dont know why i keep selecting these odd powders for review i cant tell if they have any positive or negative effects but i assume theyre healthy i add them to my smoothies and cant taste them at all
i bought a set of three bottles from a department store and there was no noticeable scent whatsoever it seems like its just a carrier oil with maybe a drop or two of the named essential oil
i expected these to be glass bottles but they turned out to be plastic they look similar to the dark amber glass bottles i have and i even interpreted the 4pound shipping weight as an indication they were glass the product description only mentions the sprayers and dropper with no details about the plastic material im not comfortable using a plastic bottle for something like colloidal silver as i prefer glass unfortunately this product did not meet my expectations and ill be disposing of it the long shipping time and restocking fee were also disappointing
these were incredibly comfortable and i wore them out quickly
theyre okay but i need more arch support for better comfort
theres no flavor but the product is easy to use and store ive been feeling stronger and my belly has flattened out hoping its a longterm benefit
this nano geocache is of great quality with a strong magnet the rainproof log rolls with metal inserts add good value

this product is effective for pain relief as long as you follow the practitioners directions its safe as it uses fruit enzymes
these balloons are good quality they didnt have any holes unlike some others they hold air well and the pink color is beautiful
i bought this for the bathroom with the cat litter box it works great and we dont notice the smell anymore
if mixed in a pitcher of liquid the taste is masked but it tastes a bit harsh when diluted in a small amount of water i take it before bed and i believe it enhances my sleep
this tissue packaging is unusual but i love that it fits in my cars drink holder the tissues are sturdy and soft and the pretty design is a plus however the cost is a bit high though its worth it for the convenience

im unsure about the effects of karela powder but i add it to my smoothies daily it blends well and doesnt affect the taste the package is small but if youre interested in it i think its fine
the product description was misleading these are meant for high arches not flat feet it caused confusion and the wrong information on the website didnt help
these scrubbers are perfect for dishwashing the sponge and steel scrubber combo work great for different tasks and theyve held up well so far
this product is just as advertised and easy to use the only downside is that the brass zipper protector leaves a brass smell on your fingers its a good product to keep kids out of medicines though scissors could cut through it the vinyl material is thicker than expected and id consider buying it again
this product works as described it loosens my pants for the day but doesnt offer a permanent solution i should probably just buy new pants instead of relying on this
good size and sturdy
these were poorly cut and took a long time to assemble the quality is poor and it looks homemade
this clip is better than the one that came with my case but it bends when clipped to anything other than a thin surface a stronger metal would have prevented this
this pendant is lovely and wellcrafted the detailing is clear and its comfortable to wear however i prefer solid backs for religious jewelry though this one is still attractive
this product was a total waste of money it didnt work at all
these socks are incredibly soft and comfortable
the directions were unclear and the heating pad didnt heat up there were no instructions on where to place it so im disappointed with this product
im allergic to this product and the smell irritates me
its great to have this box
i purchased this product to help alleviate my husbands lower back pain initially it seemed fine when applied but a few minutes later he complained of a burning sensation describing it as feeling like lava we ended up washing some off which made him feel better i used a small amount even less than a peasized amount but the intense heat was still overwhelming after the initial discomfort he said the area cooled down and felt soothing though he felt the intense heat wasnt worth the cooling effect afterward if you can handle extreme heat this product might work for you we have used other products like sombracream and icy hot without issues but they dont compare to this one we received this product at a discount for an honest review and these are my personal opinions
if youre concerned about arthritis running in your family its best to start taking preventive measures before joint deterioration occurs this supplement is highly effective for joint support containing potent antiinflammatory ingredients it doesnt work immediately so be patient as it takes time to show results i highly recommend it thanks for reading my review and i hope the information helps you make a more informed decision
this product is exactly as i expected
i struggle with anxiety and after taking one of these capsules i immediately felt much more relaxed i highly recommend it
the quantity in the package is small so it might seem expensive but the taste is quite good the flavor is similar to almonds with a slight woody taste i purchased the sweet variety so its not a concern to eat them in moderate amounts but the bitter ones can be toxic if consumed in large quantities while some health claims are exaggerated the sweet variety is safe for consumption the small quantity is the only downside
this product is sharp and easy to use
this product is poorly designed the bottom surface is too hard and lumpy making it feel like walking on rocks the hard plastic rollers were uncomfortable so i removed them but the remaining plastic posts were equally unpleasant not a good design
this product works effectively its potent so follow the instructions and take it with a substantial meal taking it on an empty stomach or with a snack caused me to feel nauseous

the fitbit aria scale has all the features youd expect from a modern scale but it doesnt do its primary job of providing consistent weight readings well if you step on the scale multiple times youll get different readings each time the syncing over wifi with your account is nice but the inconsistency in weight readings is a major drawback
everything was as expected
the package includes a large soft mask and a small cloth pouch the mask fits comfortably and blocks out all light and even though i can open my eyes underneath it i cant see anything its very comfortable wellmade and soft the price of 1259 is a bit high for just one mask but if youre purchasing two the price is much more reasonable the blue color i received is darker than what is shown on the website
this is a very good product with great taste

this product tastes pretty good though theres a slight protein flavor it mixed well even though the directions recommend using two full scoops overall its decent for the price
