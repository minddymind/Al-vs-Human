i have always had positive experiences with radha products. you truly get what you pay for, and this item is no exceptionits a quality product. it works wonders for cleaning; i apply it directly on wood and mix it with vinegar and water for mopping my floors. the scent is fresh and pleasant.

these replacement brush heads have been great. the bristles are mediumsoftslightly firmer than braun's ultrasoft heads, but not as rigid as regular ones. while i generally prefer ultrasoft bristles, these have not caused any irritation. they fit my oral b toothbrush well, with no need for force, just the right fit. the packaging is excellent; each brush is sealed and has a plastic cap to keep the bristles in shape. overall, a solid alternative to branded heads.

this toddler bed footrest hammock is a musthave. the design is well thought out for ease of setup without disturbing the passenger in front. the lightweight, durable material is easy to store and fits into a carryon bag. it even includes a bottle holder and a nonslip back. highly recommend getting one.

the item arrived earlier than expected and exceeded my expectations! absolutely love these roller balls!

the rhino boot cleaner was out of stock, so i ordered this one, which looked similar. however, it lacks one of the horizontal brushes for the boot sole and sheds bristles.

i have plantar fasciitis, and it is been really painful. i hoped these insoles would help, but they did not provide any relief. i tried them several times and alternated with my usual inserts, but they did not work. thanks anyway.

i have only had this product for a few days, but after using it for just two days, i felt significant relief from my allergies. on the third day, i woke up with a migraine due to juniper pollen. thanks to this inhaler, i was able to get out of bed and function. its the only thing that stopped the pain in its tracks. i am amazed!

when it works, its fantastic, but it tends to cut in and out when in motion.

i love my dogs, but one of them used to rip out the insoles of my shoes when he was a puppy. these new insoles are soft and offer great cushioning, without crowding or cramping my feet. they are especially comfortable on bare skin. a touch of luxury for your feet.

i am a big fan of beets and will take them any way i can get them, including powdered. this beet powder has a fresh beet flavor, and so far, it seems to be of excellent quality. i add it to smoothies, and i am excited to try it in batters and soups. its a great addition to muffins, pancakes, and breads. if you like sipping broths, this is a nice addition to a hot cup of broth.

i absolutely love this little batterypowered lighter! it makes lighting my candles a breeze. such a handy item!

unfortunately, this did not fix my unit. it would not shut off and continuously sprayed when turned on. i returned it for a refund.

these liners work best if your boots do not have fur lining. otherwise, they might not fit without bunching. they do an excellent job of keeping the cold out.

it took a bit of time to tie all the words together, but the effort was definitely worth it.

i ordered this for my mother, as it was used in the hospital. it is great protein and beneficial for wound healing. as an right now, i recommend highprotein options for recovery.

this product works very well for my mom.

absolutely love this product!

i sometimes get a stiff neck from whiplash, and i thought this would help. it felt a bit too sharp on my neck at first, but i may need to use it more to see if it makes a difference. it is easy to use and wellmade.

we have a cat who needs to take a very tiny pill twice a day. this product worked great for splitting the pills in half.

these glasses are both stylish and functional. i wear them while road biking, and they provide protection from the sun while allowing me to easily read my bike computer.

although a bit pricey, they are beautiful and work really well.

the smell was unbearable. i kept the product in its original box and placed it in the garage. there is no way i could use it.

the product worked just fine. now i just need to get the broken underground wires fixed!

it looked great.

they are nice but a little expensive. they provide good moisture without feeling greasy. i also like the different flavors.

i drank this product yesterday as instructed, and it gave me more energy than expected during my evening tennis practice. after a strenuous workout earlier that day, i was feeling drained, but after consuming it, i felt great and played well. the flavor is sweet with a coconut hint, though i wish it was not so sweet. i plan to add lemon juice next time to balance it out.

this scrub brush is a great addition to my skincare routine. i initially thought it would spin, but its actually better that it does not, as it would be too harsh. the brush vibrates at different speeds, and i love using both the soft brush and the sponge head. the brush comes with a convenient stand, and the green color matches my other items. it is easy to use and perfect for anyone with sensitive hands.

this seems like a complete reinvention of electric razors for women. it can be used immediately, even before it is fully charged, thanks to the long charging cord. the shaving head follows the curves of my legs easily, and the sleek design is much improved from older models. it comes with a cleaning brush and carrying case. i am completely satisfied with this product.

absolutely love this product.

this pin is large and solid. the steel shafts are thick enough to prevent bending, but it makes it harder to work with thicker cloth materials.

yum! this adds a delicious almond chocolate flavor to my coffee, similar to an almond joy candy bar! i deducted one star because it is a bit pricey for such a small bag, but the taste makes it worth it.

this supplement contains ingredients known for supporting joint health, like chondroitin, glucosamine sulfate, msm, and turmeric. its a good supplement, but improvement will take time. if you are looking for faster results, i recommend trying golden paste with turmeric.

this product was inexpensive, arrived quickly, and worked well for my dogs foot. the cute patterns on the wrap are a bonus, and i love that it comes with two different sizes. great product!

these liners are perfect for small trash cans in my house. they make changing trash bags easy. though thin, they serve their purpose well.

they work great.

this product is durable and a fantastic idea.

i only received one that was correct.

sleeping masks have been a great help when my husband watches tv late or during summer mornings when the sun rises early. these are lightweight, soft, and adjustable for the perfect fit. they block most of the light, though some still leaks in around the sides. comfortable for sleep, and i always keep one in my suitcase for travel.

i did not purchase this from amazon but received it as a christmas gift. after inserting the batteries and turning it on, they exploded. this seems very dangerous.

this product smells better than aqua reef and goes on smoothly like all old spice gel deodorants. it lasts all day. i highly recommend it for anyone who wants to smell great!

this is a gimmicky product. save your money and opt for a classic eyelash curler instead; it works much better.

this bath brush is great. the handle is long and wellbuilt, though a bit heavy, making it sturdy and durable.

my wife loves this product; it finally provides a place to store all her oils and keep them organized.

blue bags, blue bags. what are you going to do? love these blue bags!

the pictures may make it seem bigger than it actually is, so be mindful of its true size. its quiet, and the short cord makes it perfect for use in your car.

i usually love unflavored peptides, but this cucumber aloe flavor is awful.

the biggest issue with these was the poor fit around my nose, causing my glasses to fog up no matter what i tried.

we have been trying to eat a wholefood, plantbased diet, and this spinach powder makes it easier to incorporate more vegetables. it has a mild flavor and adds to sauces, soups, and even baked goods. its a convenient option.

this daily shower cleaner is fantastic, and its hard to find in stores. i have been using it for years and was thrilled to be able to order it online. it works great and even came recommended by the professional who fixed my shower.

if you need vegetable glycerin, this product is perfect. the packaging is excellent, and the price is reasonable. i have purchased several essential depot products and have never been disappointed!

creating custom essential oil blends has become an enjoyable hobby for me, and black pepper is a new addition i am excited about. its warm, spicy aroma brings an exotic touch to my blends, complementing woody scents like pine, cypress, and cedarwood. it also pairs nicely with citrus notes such as neroli and bergamot. its a great choice for rooms where relaxation is the goal, and it surprisingly aids in better sleep. overall, its a worthwhile purchase, and i highly recommend it. i hope this review helps in making your decision!

i had hoped this product would help with the sun damage on my face, but after using it for several weeks, i have not noticed any improvement. while the pads and serum feel nice on my skin, there has not been any change in my complexion.

a lovely album! i am looking forward to choosing some special photos to add to it.

no issues with the order. it arrived quickly.

these gloves are fantastic! they provide excellent grip thanks to the granules on the palms and fingers, making tasks like washing dishes much easier. they are latexfree, waterproof, and come up high on the arms, keeping you dry. plus, the different colors make it easy to keep track of which pair is for which room. i love them!

highquality, thick, soft gloves with no fragrance.

the variety of colors is simply stunning!

they fit well. just be sure to wash off any nose oil with soap before swimming to prevent them from sliding off during the swim.

this product contains a blend of b vitamins and caffeine, which will definitely help keep you awake, especially on nights when staying up is necessary. the niacinamide may cause a brief flush on your face, but that is a normal side effect that fades quickly.

i had a secondhand wood table with marks from years of use. while the character marks were fine, i could not stand the white heat or water rings from recent use. after applying this product, those white marks disappeared with minimal effort, and some of the older character marks faded too. the table now looks almost new! it did not have much of a smell, which i appreciated since i live in an apartment with limited ventilation. for the price, this is a great product to try before considering professional restoration.

at 125 mcg 5,000 iu, these vitamin d3 pills are just the right dosage for me. they are small and easy to swallow, and since d3 is fatsoluble, it stays in your system longer. the bottle is larger than necessary for the amount, but it contains 60 small capsules, each made with coconut oil.

i am giving this product 2 stars because the steam feature did not work. the button is supposed to activate when the plates touch, but no steam came out, no matter how many attempts i made. since steam was a key reason i bought this, i am disappointed its not working as expected.

i mostly work from home and homeschool my kids, so we generally have minimal exposure to germs. however, i have been using this product to boost my immune system when i go out. though its hard to say exactly what works, i have not had any side effects, and i appreciate that it adds to my wellness routine. i trust this brand, as they invented the type of oral probiotic i have been using.

after using elderberry capsules, i decided to try this organic elderberry syrup for the winter. it tastes great  not too sweet, just right. i am glad i have it stocked up for the cold months ahead.

these have great capacity and come in a lovely color. i am really happy with them.

i have been using this product for quite a while. i decided to buy in bulk rather than getting smaller packets, and its been perfect for my needs.

i have sensitive skin and use this to treat dry patches. in colder months, i apply it to my face and neck before bed, and my skin looks fantastic by morning!

it works decently, but the onoff and temperature buttons are placed awkwardly on the handle. i keep pressing them accidentally. for mediumlength hair, the curling action is more effective on longer hair.

my son is thrilled with these! they look incredibly realistic, and his father even mistook them for scratches from kittens were fostering. it was a fun prank! i am glad i purchased them through the promotion. i bought four sets, and my son cannot wait to use them for halloween!

unfortunately, this product did not help increase my alkaline levels. when i tested it daily, my levels actually dropped. sparkling mineral waters from trader joes worked better for me.

these are great for cold nights when you need to keep your feet warm to fall asleep. they fit a bit tight but do the job well. do not try to walk in them, though!

this tape did not work well for me. it came off too easily, and it was not wide enough to be durable.

it stopped working after just half a use. its cheaply made.

i love the idea behind these reusable bamboo makeup remover pads. they are large enough to fit over my eyes for a relaxing treatment. the material is soft but not as absorbent as id like. i like that they are ecofriendly and come with a nice bamboo holder.

this product quit working after just three uses. the light will not turn on, and id advise against purchasing it.

this eye mask is a great idea. the ear muffs helped block out noise while i was sleeping, but being a side sleeper, i found them a bit uncomfortable. the soft silicone material is nice, but the design could be better for side sleepers. its still a great option for travel.

i have been using this cleaner for years, and i am glad i stocked up. i have noticed that its becoming harder to find in stores, but thankfully, i can still order it on amazon. it works really well and has a pleasant scent.

i take lysine for two reasons it helps with calcium absorption and reduces excretion. this supplement works well, and i am pleased with the results.

meh, it did not do much for straightening my hair.

i gave this five stars because it works perfectly. my wife would only rate it one star because it works so well. the metal construction is solid and not flimsy.

these are fantastic! they are lightweight, large, and come with a handy neck strap. i wear them daily and love how durable and washable they are.

i have always used garlic to boost my immune system, but this supplement offers the same benefits without the hassle of carrying garlic cloves. its easy to take, stays fresh for a long time, and does not leave a bad taste. id recommend it!

my rental property had terrible white grout. after spraying this cleaner on and letting it sit, the grout looked much better. ill definitely be stocking up.

the product arrived in a bubble envelope, but some items were broken. it still smelled nice, though.

this product broke quickly. its poorly made.

great product with fast delivery!

it has a taffylike texture, and the flavor is okay, but i prefer their espresso bar, which needs to be heated.

we love this new scale! it syncs with our fitbit app and is helping us maintain a healthier lifestyle.

i bought this after my knee replacement, and its been great for icing. the ace packs freeze quickly and stay pliable, lasting around 30 minutes. they are perfect for recovery and general aches.

i have bought these pillowpaws skidresistant socks before in xxl and loved them. this time i ordered a smaller size for my grandson, but they were not as high quality as the last pair. i am not planning to order from this vendor again.

this white noise machine is compact, easy to set up, and has a variety of sounds to choose from. its great for both adults and children, though the control panel can be difficult to read in dim light.

this step does not meet my expectations. it slides around, and i have almost fallen a few times. even after trying to add tape to the bottom, it remains slippery.

i use this product for almost everything. it is incredibly durable!

these protein powders come in fantastic flavors, offering a high amount of protein with minimal carbs or sugars. i have been buying them for years and continue to love them.

this grapeseed oil did not work well for my homemade cosmetics. unlike other organic oils, it has a deep yellowishgreen color and a strong, almost sour smell. i used to use a grapeseed oil that was almost odorless and had a pale yellow color.

hemp is a versatile plant that can be turned into so many things, and this product is topnotch.

i love this productits fantastic. however, the small size was not sealed properly and arrived dry.

we have endured half a bottle of these awful vitamins over several months, only taking them when we are out of our usual flintstones vitamins. after my kids complained about the aftertaste, i tried one myself, and they truly are terrible. do not waste your money.

this item is difficult to find now, so i do not waste it on my dishwasher. when i open a box, i transfer it into a recycled heinz ketchup bottle to dispense it. its my goto for cleaning the glass jar of my blender. just squirt some in with hot water, blend, and rinse.

i thought these were a great idea, but they are not practical in use. they tend to splatter when you increase the speed enough to clean. i have better luck with a handheld cleaning brush.

this is an excellent callous remover. it does not hurt the foot and effectively scrapes off stubborn, hard skin on the heels.

this product is the best on the market. customer service is excellentresponsive and easy to talk to. it alleviates my aches and pains, and it also works well for stomach issues due to its ginger content. i have reduced my stomach medication by half using this turmeric. i highly recommend it!

i purchased designer frames that look great but do not stay on my small nose. after ordering this product, i experienced delays and was offered the option to cancel, which i did. however, it stayed in my queue as if i was still waiting for it. ill check my account to ensure i was not charged. id still love to try it if it ever arrives.

as a vaper, i often need to change my coils unexpectedly. these blunttipped syringes are perfect for draining vape juice before removing the coil, preventing waste. they work as expectedsucking up and dispensing liquid without issue.

this product works exactly as shown. very effective.

i like that these do not dissolve when using essential oils with them.

it fits on top of our round toilet seat and works similarly to the sitz bath i had from the hospital. i add salts to relieve hemorrhoid pain.

this cocoa bean facial scrub did not work well for me. its thick and dispenses like toothpaste, with small cacao "nibs" for exfoliation. it has a pleasant chocolate scent that fades quickly. while it softens the skin, it did not reduce redness, clear dull spots, or provide a glow. i will not be using this product again.

this product is becoming harder to find. please do not stop carrying itmy hair would suffer without it! it is the best i have found.

these masks do not seem effective at blocking small particles like dust or viruses, despite proper usage. they may be suitable for occasional use, but for virus prevention, consider adding a secondary mask for additional protection.

i milk a nigerian dwarf goat, and this supplement should last her entire lactation. other goat owners recommended it, and i am happy with the resultsit keeps her healthy.

the callous remover works well, but the epilator does not seem effective.

these would likely work for other shoes, but the pin was too thick for the shoes i needed to fix.

this ashwagandha powder has helped me manage stress and supported virility. i have been adding it to my morning smoothies, and i have noticed a difference. it has a slightly bitter taste but does not ruin the flavor of my smoothie. its a great addition to my routine.

wilson naturals beet product is the besttasting beet supplement i have tried. it mixes easily into smoothies, bakes well, and is easy to drink. their customer service is topnotch, and i would love to see more products like this in the future.

i have been taking this supplement for a week to help with spider veins and bruising. its working well in combination with my weight loss routine, and i have noticed a reduction in swelling and improvement in vein appearance. no side effects so far.

this product is effective, though i feel i need more than three sprays to clean my mat. still, it picks up grime consistently, so it seems to be working.

its almost impossible to push the plunger on this product. i ordered a couple more thinking it was just one defective item, but they were all the same. i am disappointed by the poor design and would not recommend it.

this product is worth the money! its far more comfortable than cotton or fleece memory foam cushions. highly recommend!

these are easy to usejust pull! a great product that i will definitely buy again.

still figuring out the curling results, but it might be my fault.

these are tiny and look too garish. they appear tacky and are not very useful.

these work great for cleaning screens.

perfect for banana split parties! good quality materials and great for reuse by multiple generations. a fun addition to any party!

this is a cool product for those in california. its definitely a conversation starter and makes my friends jealous.

i love the variety of temperatures in this product. it quickly smooths my hair, is lightweight, and easy to use with either hand.

if you read a lot and struggle with bloodshot eyes, these eye drops work fast to clear up redness. however, they should be used sparingly to avoid the opposite effect. consult a doctor if symptoms persist.

this color set is rare, offering base, matte top, and glossy top coats. the colors match what you see in the picture, and the low odor is a plus. it lasts about 710 days for me, depending on nail growth.

i love using this cold roller for localized cold therapy and a massage effect, especially for my hands to relieve carpal tunnel pain.

i have noticed improvements in memory and general wellbeing after using this supplement. at 71, i am seeing a significant difference. i take a lower dose, as i prefer not to maximize the dosage recommendations, but it still works great for me.

living in florida, i installed this filter to improve my shower water. since then, my hair is softer and i see fewer spots on the shower glass. its an affordable and effective solution.

this teethwhitening product works well, even if you do not wait the full 30 minutes. it foams slightly, sticks to discoloration, and is easy to use. i am satisfied with the results so far.

i purchased this for my dogs and horses. its much more affordable than individual supplements, and i use a gram scoop for their servings.

these reading glasses are perfect! the frames are thin, lightweight, and come in three attractive colors. the included cases are compact and practical for storage or travel.

ideal for trauma nursing!

the padding is comfortable, almost like sitting on firm jelly. its great for desk work but might be too high for car seats. time will tell how durable it is.

somewhat disappointing. the head is too small, and not as full as expected.

i have been looking for more elderberry products due to its potent antiviral properties, especially in fighting off colds and flu. when i came across this elderberry powder, i had to try it. i mixed a scoop with about 4 ounces of cold water and stirred until it dissolved. the taste was pleasantly neutral, not bitter at all. a touch of honey made it even easier to drink. the packaging mentions that a serving is 2g of powder, but does not specify additional ingredients like vitaminsthis info is available on the product page. i believe this is a solid product and will keep it on hand for the upcoming cold and flu season.

i am not entirely sure about its effectiveness, but i keep it plugged in in my kitchen 247. it looks nice and provides a soft ambient light.

astragalus root is an adaptogen from traditional chinese medicine, known for supporting the immune and cardiovascular systems, and being a powerful antiinflammatory. this powder comes in a small resealable pouch and is clean, vegan, glutenfree, and nongmo. it has a distinct earthy taste that blends well with smoothies, juices, or other foods. while i cannot pinpoint any specific benefits, i generally feel better when i take it. there have been no negative side effects, but if you are on medication, especially immunosuppressants or lithium, consult your physician. overall, i am pleased with this product; it seems pure and mixes well.

i bought three of these for our flight to italy. they worked great, were compact enough for carryons, and easy to inflate. i did get additional screening at security, and they attributed it to the folded footrest, though my travel companions had similar ones without issue. who knows?

i understand the high price of this fish oil, but its worth it if the numerous studies on its benefits are accurate. initially, i was hesitant about the pure oil due to concerns over taste, but i am happy to report that its completely free of any fishy flavor, and no fish burps either unlike with the capsules. the texture is a bit oily, but the taste is purely orange. i find it works well when eaten with leafy greens to balance the oily sensation.

these framar nitrile gloves have been a lifesaver for me as i need to protect my hands and fingers. after years of cleaning, my skin is sensitive even to mild dish soap, so these powderfree, latexfree gloves are perfect. they are easy to put on and take off, tough against chemicals, and they do not irritate my skin. the medium size fits well, allowing me to handle tactile tasks. these gloves provide great protection from dish soap, cleaning solvents, oils, dyes, paints, turpentine, garden chemicals, soil, and moreideal for my needs.

i am very satisfied with these. a great price for the product!

these are excellent for keeping my skin protected from the adhesive on the cover roll stretch tape.

as someone who plays a lot of competitive tennis, i felt fatigued after a tough match last weekend. i drank about 14 ounces of the vital performance recovery drink, and it helped me feel better. the rest of the bottle has been sitting in my fridge for a week, and although the taste was not great, i plan to take it with me to my next match and see if it helps maintain my energy levels. i like the idea of recovery drinks but need something more palatable.

this is hands down the best straightener i have used, although it can be harsh on hair. it heats up quickly, cools down just as fast, and lasts a long time.

very satisfied with this product.

i love this stuff! its perfect for a quick moisture boost. it has a pleasant, subtle scent and a reliable pump.

i collect rubber ducks, and a friend jokingly recommended i get this one. pros its a cute duck! cons 1. its not waterproof; the battery compartment is not fully sealed, so be cautious if you want to use it in water. 2. the vibration frequency is not ideal for this kind of toy. it might get the job done, but for the price, you can get a waterproof pocket vibe like a wevibe. 3. the plastic is very hard; although it claims to be bodysafe, its quite sturdy. if you want a quirky collectible, go for it. but if you need a functional vibrating bath toy, look elsewhere.

this pill case keychain has been a great addition to my routine. i take medications daily, and this handy gadget keeps them safe and secure. the waterproof and dustproof design ensures my pills stay protected. its easy to access by unscrewing the cap, and its always visible on my keychain, reminding me to take them. it also comes with some useful freebies. ill definitely buy this again.

this mask seems decent; once you insert a filter, its thick and fairly comfortable to wear.

i purchased this glycerin for a skincare recipe for my face and would recommend it to friends and family. ill be repurchasing in the future.

if you are out in hot weather or working hard, adding this liquid to your water helps replenish electrolytes. its also useful for preventing leg cramps.

these discs leave a residue in the toilet as they she would their outer layer.

very stylish and versatile!

the pill size seems manageable; its smaller than many other vitamin pills. be sure to consult your doctor to see if these will benefit you. overall, i think they are good, and i hope they provide benefits.

this product contains echinacea, which may help fight colds for some people. i have used it in pill form with mixed results. this tincture combines echinacea with other herbs, like green tea and elderberry. the taste is syrupy due to the vegetable glycerin base, which can soothe the throat. while the flavor is a bit odda semispicy aftertastei did not mind it. the dropper and glass bottle are of good quality. though i cannot make strong claims about its effectiveness, its worth trying. just do not expect immediate relief from cold symptoms.

i appreciated receiving a fullsized bottle of another product as a gift with my purchase.

my daughter used to have frequent utis until we found this product. its perfect for swimmers or those who teach swimming!

these pads are soft, reusable, and a great alternative to cotton balls. quality is excellent!

the natural silk sleep mask is a remarkable product. it provides excellent comfort, especially for those like me who are day sleepers due to night shifts. the fine silk construction is so delicate that i hardly notice it, and it effectively blocks out light through the eyelids. i am genuinely impressed with its performance. sleep restoration, thank you for this thoughtful product; its a game changer for me.

while the picture shows a safety belt, this product is a gel pad designed for cpap users. after developing a pressure ulcer from my fullface mask, i found these gel pads to be a lifesaver. i applied them along with antibacterial gel, and they provided soothing relief. the ulcer healed, and now i feel confident again using my mask without worry. these gel pads are indispensable, and i would not want to be without them.

with flu season and the ongoing presence of covid, i find it reassuring to have extra toothbrush heads readily available. these brush heads work perfectly with my sonicare. the bristles are soft, offering a gentle yet effective clean without causing any damage to my gums or teeth. the pack provides great value, and i am very happy with my purchase.

i was hoping for a better experience, but unfortunately, this product did not live up to expectations. my previous smoke buddy lasted much longer, while this one became difficult to use after only a week and a half. it no longer allowed airflow and i will be looking for an alternative next time.

this product is fantastic for relieving trigger points on my neck. however, if you prefer a softer touch, this may not be ideal as it applies significant pressure.

this party kit has everything you need for a delightful celebration! the cute unicorn pattern is adorable, and the plasticware, cups, and plates are surprisingly durable. the hats are wellmade too. if you know a unicorn fan, this is a musthave.

i often suffer from sinus headaches, and while allergy medications tend to dry me out, this product provides the moisture i need. it is especially useful during the winter when i use my cpap at night. i prefer this to using water in the humidifier as it gives me a more comfortable start.

this has become my husband's favorite protein powder. he had been searching for a protein that did not have a terrible taste after switching from whey. this vegan powder surprised him with its smooth texture and pleasant flavor. the only downside is the higher price, but its definitely worth it for him.

while we have had some issues with the fitbit ionic, other fitbit products have been great for tracking our daily activities. the fitbit aria smart scale is especially impressive, with its ability to track up to 10 individuals using ai. while the price is a bit higher than other scales, the convenience and features make it a worthwhile investment.

while these might be great for others, i found that they did not offer enough cushioning to make a noticeable difference for me.

i had high hopes for these tart cherry capsules to help with my insomnia, but unfortunately, they did not have any positive effect on my sleep. from what others have shared, they may work for different purposes, but they were not helpful for my issue. i would not recommend them specifically for sleep.

these generic cleaning cartridges are a great value and perform just as well as the brandname options. ill continue purchasing them for their effectiveness and affordability.

my husband was initially skeptical, but after giving it a try, he ended up liking it.

forskolin is a powerful supplement with numerous health benefits. it works by increasing cellular camp, which can have positive effects on various conditions like asthma, heart issues, weight loss, and more. it also helps regulate blood pressure, boost heart function, and even aids in fat burning. for those dealing with obesity or thyroid issues, forskolin might be a helpful addition to your health regimen.

this product works well and meets my expectations.

i have been using this trigger point release tool for both personal use and with patients for years, and it has always been effective.

i wear a womens size 7, and although the small slippers were a bit large, i adjusted them with the rope to fit snugly. the interior was soft, and while the battery pack at the top felt a bit bulky when walking, the slippers were still great overall. they kept my feet warm, especially on the highest setting.

the design feels a bit awkward to hold, and as a result, some shavings do not make it into the cup. however, it does a good job and is easy to clean.

these are perfect for travel. they are compact and convenient.

i noticed that this product left a film on my mats, and the scent was not very pleasant. that is just my personal observation.

it is alright, but i am unsure of its effectiveness. ill need to see more results over time.

this daylight alarm is effective at waking me up. the led light arcs over the bed, ensuring it reaches my eyes even if i am not facing the lamp. the swivel head is a nice feature for directing the light. however, the user interface is confusing, making it frustrating to set up. the process to turn the alarm on and off is unnecessarily complicated and not intuitive at all. its a shame because the lamp works well once its set up.

these crystals and stones have an appealing aesthetic and are convenient to carry, making them a good option for stress relief on the go.

excellent product! it worked perfectly and was an effortless fix. i would definitely buy it again!

for just 9.99, you get a variety of tools. its not ideal for gifting since it does not come in a box or have a storage pouch like most other sets i have ordered. i was surprised that everything arrived safely since the pieces were only packaged in plastic or bubble bags. i did wonder if the pieces were made from genuine stone or plastic because they did not feel as cool as other stone tools i have purchased. aventurine lacks the natural patterns of stones like amethyst, so it does resemble plastic more. some pieces have natural flaws, like pitting. the roller is smooth and quiet, though its not the best quality. for example, the glue is a bit messy. overall, its a good set for the price.

these clear shoe straps are great! i use them to keep my shoes on, not just with high heels.

nice bandage, though a bit small. does not stick well, but still nice.

this backnobber works well! i love that its detachable. the different sized curves make it easy to reach most parts of my back, and it provides good leverage for a firm application.

we frequently take probiotics and i try to switch up the brands since they each contain different strains. this will be a nice addition to my collection, and well rotate them in our daily routine.

while the patterns are cute and i like that its washable, i find it uncomfortable when i breathe in and it becomes annoying, especially during exertion. its pretty much useless for active use.

a lot of paper! i filled over 15 baskets at work. ill buy it again next season.

its more sweet than salty, and in my opinion, it cannot replace regular soy sauce in recipes. however, its a great table condiment for rice or meat dishes, and its glutenfree. ill definitely buy it again. thanks, bragg!

these softgels are large but easy to swallow. they are smooth and have no fishy aftertaste, with just a hint of lemon. the 60 softgel bottle is a 30day supply, providing a good amount of fish oil. i take them after my first meal of the day to help with cholesterol, and i do not experience any stomach upset. i usually buy liquid fish oil in higher doses, but these softgels have a solid amount, and i am happy with them. i have not had any fishy burps, likely because i take them after eating.

great purchaseno aftertaste!

i bought these for facial pain, and they fit perfectly. i use flour sack cloths to cover them, which makes them super soft and provides enough length to wrap around my head to hold the cold pack in place. they have been a lifesaver for my migraines. i am really glad i bought them.

the dosage is 6 pills twice a day, which is not very costeffective. it smells fine and tastes fine, but the large dose does not seem to offer many benefits. i prefer a oncedaily tablet.

what a difference! i cannot believe i lived without one of these. its a bit cumbersome when sitting, but its great to use.

great product, but it tends to rub off easily, requiring several reapplications. however, it performs very well when applied.

perfect for our white elephant party.

this brand was cheaper than another popular brand, but its still good. i have used it for a few weeks, heating it in the microwave every week or so. i bought another one for an upcoming trip because i wanted a fresh sponge. it works well to get my face clean.

a very featurerich and costeffective shaver.

i recently bought some lather cream for my husband as an alternative to his regular shaving cream. when i got a coupon for a shaving brush, i grabbed it to help him use the lather cream properly. after a couple of weeks of use, hes pleased with it. the packaging was impressive, and the brush handle is sturdy and fits well in his hand. the beaver hair is surprisingly soft. initially, there was some shedding, but it stopped after the first few hairs. my husband has no prior experience with lather brushes, but this one seems to be doing a good job.

i have already used a few of these towels to clean my air fry oven and microwave, and they did an excellent job. they made both look like new again. the main reason i wanted them, though, is for the cabinet painting project i have undertaken. these towels will be great for cleaning up the chemicals and scrubbing during the prep work. they are also excellent for wiping sanding dust between coats, leaving no lint behind, unlike paper towels. these towels are incredibly durable and clean better than others i have used. i highly recommend them!

i really like this eyelash curler, though its a bit pricey. i have sparse eyelashes, but the tension spring helps to lengthen them somewhat.

i love this little mat! its very easy to use and warms my feet in no time. its made from premium materials and feels like it will last a long time. the temperature control is very convenient and can be adjusted by foot, making it perfect for warming my cold feet whenever i need it.

i have sinus issues and use tissues a lot. i am picky about the quality since i use them every day. i do not like tissues that are too thin or too thick, and i do not usually use tissues with lotion. however, these are perfect. they are not too thin or thick, comfortable, and easy to use. they are not scratchy, do not fall apart, and they leave my nose happy.

this is on my nightstand, and i absolutely love it. i add a few drops of essential oils, and i sleep like a baby!

it did not leak, and it was a great purchase for what i needed.

i bought one for myself a few years ago, and it has held up to weekly use ever since. its strong, sturdy, and easy to use. i soak my feet and ankles with some epsom salts and aveeno packets for a relaxing experience. i loved it so much that i bought one for my dad when he started having foot problems. warm water and epsom salts are all you need to enjoy the bliss.

i do not understand how anyone could like this oil. it smells just like house paint. i expected an earthy, herbal chamomile scent, but all i got was the smell of paint. i had a couple of people doublecheck, and they agreed it smelled like paint fumes.

exactly as described. the tablecloths are thin plastic but held up just fine throughout the party. worked out great.

this organizer helps me stay on track with my medication. in just a few moments, i am ready for the week ahead.

these bottles are perfect for blending essential oils. the 10 ml size is great for home use or travel. i prefer glass bottles, and these are made from colored blue glass, which protects the contents from light. the roller snaps on securely and glides smoothly. i filled one and laid it on its side for 15 minutes, and it did not leak. the price is great, and the order arrived quickly with prime shipping. i am very happy with these bottles and will order from this supplier again.

love it! its easy to use, and it tastes and smells great!

this is 3 ounces, not 3 pounds, but it arrived on time.

the setup process was simple, and it works perfectly!

i take one of these daily at this dosage, and it has nearly eliminated the arthritis pain in my hands. i was previously unable to walk two miles without stopping due to pain. after being introduced to turmeric curcumin with black pepper by a friend, i have been using it for two years, and it provides the right combination. i now walk two miles without any pain at all.

i bought this for my mom, who has an issue with her glasses sliding down her nose. she says it helps a bit, but i am uncertain if i will repurchase.

i used these capsules for about a month but did not notice any positive effects. i have not reordered.

this replacement bowl and lid fit perfectly and work well.

the replacement fits the wp100 and works great. thanks for providing a solution since our hose cracked at the handle, allowing us to get more use out of the unit.

i was not sure how well this would work, but i am pleasantly surprised! it charges via usb in a couple of hours, and after turning it on, you can easily light candles and other items. at first, i did not realize you had to press the button after sliding it to the on position, but once i figured that out, it worked perfectly. i love it and it will save me money on buying long lighters.

the scent has a lavender note, but its not the strong, unmistakable fragrance i have encountered with true lavender or lavandin. it has a slightly chemical pinelike scent that i am not fond of. there is no botanical information on the bottle, so i am fairly certain this is not true lavender.

these gilding flakes have a beautiful fall color and will look fantastic on any project.

the product is easy to use and of good quality. thank you.

it worked very well for my needs.

i really like this toothbrush. i can use it for about two weeks before needing to recharge. it has many great settings. i would repurchase if needed.

i have been using this cotton for my vape for the last three years. every time i try another brand, my vape flavor suffers, either dulling the flavor or leaving a chemical aftertaste. this cotton makes a huge difference. its worth the price, and one bag lasts a long time.

i have been using this for years, and now i have a convenient case to carry it in my purse.

this product works perfectly for combining medications for emergency useexactly what we needed!

neither size stayed in my ear. id recommend going with highquality foam instead. i threw these away immediately.

the product arrived quickly and is exactly as shown online. the colors match the photos perfectly. the product came in a plastic case for storage, but the top had a crack upon arrival, though it was not a big deal. the product works as expected, though getting your pet to cooperate may require some patience. its best to start using this product when they are a puppy or kitten. the material of the finger brush is good quality, and it stayed on my finger during use. there are two brushes, but i am not sure why, since you can only use one at a time.

my feet feel great, and there is no greasy residue.

you get what you pay for. the product is cheaply made and not worth the effort.

this product helped remove hard water stains around our sink area. we have severe hard water problems, and i am happy that something works. my husband has been using it for about a week, and the difference is noticeable.

i have bought this product many times, but this time the formula, flavor, and texture have changedits terrible! i will not buy it again. this also happened with the mrm protein powder. why the change?

the scent is not strong enough.

its too soon for me to tell if this works.

i have been using this for a month, and the wood still looks fine in my shower with no peeling or warping. no bristles have fallen out. however, the bristles are very hard and scratchyquite painful. they have not softened even after a month of daily use. the plastic side is useless, and its the only part that has discolored. i cannot really recommend it, so be cautious when ordering.

these are great!

horrible! it turned my finger green in two days, and i never even got it wet! its not worth the hassle to return. i regret purchasing one for a friend, and i am not giving it to her.

i reordered this after seeing good results from my first purchase. some people have trouble getting the powder to dissolve, but the company sent me helpful instructions. initially, it will be clumpy and cloudy in cold distilled water, but after a few hours in the refrigerator, it clears and gels. i dilute it to the consistency i want, and the gel works wonders for my face. it does not irritate my skin, unlike other products with preservatives. i also use it as a topical cream for my knees and wrists in hopes it helps with my arthritis. it can be taken internally as well.

i use this soylent powder daily in my morning shakes, and the packets were very convenient for travel.

it is cheaper than the mlm version i use occasionally. when i took it daily, my hair became much darker.

i really like this product. at first, i was concerned about the small size of the compartments, but they hold my critical prescription meds just fine. i keep my larger supplements in another container. the only issue is that a couple of compartments do not stay closed without effort, but with 122 out of 124 working properly, i am happy with it. the daily container is small enough to fit in my purse, so i always have it with me. it was easy to load, and now i have a full month ready.

from a beauty device enthusiast's perspective, this brush set offers excellent value. its batteryoperated, so there is no need to stay plugged into an outlet. it is sealed, so it is safe to use in the shower. it includes a large body brush, a smaller face brush, a sponge head, and a pumice. the rotary action is different from the sonic vibration of a clairsonic, but its great for pumice use. i think it excels as a body brush, prepping legs and arms before a shower. used wet with soap or body cleanser, it exfoliates and helps skin look brighter by encouraging cell renewal.

i thought i was getting a larger size, but when i received the small bag, i was disappointed. the amount i got is worth no more than 5, yet i paid over ten dollars. i feel ripped off because i did not pay close attention to the ounces. be warned.

i added this to my protein or fruit smoothies, and i loved it. drinking it plain in water was a bit much, but in milk or nondairy alternatives like vanilla soy or oat, it tastes great.

i love this sound maker! i have ordered several, some as gifts. it allows me to watch tv after my husband goes to bed because hes a light sleeper. he initially complained it was too loud, but if he had read the directions, he would have seen there is a volume control. he did not say anything, so now i can watch tv when hes asleep. yay!

a great purchase!

the ladder is extremely durable, and i feel confident it will support my husband's weight when he needs to reach higher spots.

the bottle claimed it was grey, but it turned out to be navy blue. additionally, it peels off quite easily. overall, i was disappointed with the product.

as someone with sensitive skin, this product has been great for maintaining the health of my hair without causing any irritation.

i purchased this kit for my heels before my college graduation, hoping it would help. unfortunately, it provided no support and only caused blisters in the same shoes i had worn without issue before. i would not recommend it.

absolutely love it! the quality is fantastic, and it looks stunning!

these masks are comfortable, fit well, and have a neutral design, but they have a strong plasticlike odor when first taken out of the package. after a few hours, the smell was still noticeable, and i hope it fades with time.

this holidaythemed face mask set is adorable. they fit my 8yearold perfectly, and she loves wearing them to school to showcase her festive spirit. she found them to be comfortable and breathable.

i enjoy using this bath body brush because it has the ideal firmness for exfoliation  firm enough for effective scrubbing, yet gentle enough not to cause irritation. however, after some time, the bristles start shedding, and the plastic sheet holding them falls apart, making it unusable. i bought a second one, hoping it lasts longer.

a convenient key ring with several small plastic containers, perfect for carrying oils to the gym or for any other uses. it is compact and easy to carry around.

i found similar ones at the dollar store that were more appealing.

it helps purify the air before you inhale, which is a nice feature.

after using fulvic and humic acids in shilajit form for a while, i decided to try trace minerals' version. while it is not as concentrated as shilajit, the large bottle and flavorless nature make it a good, costeffective supplement. though i cannot say for sure if it improves gut health, i find it to be a valuable addition to my routine.

it works as expected.

the taste is great and makes for a convenient, tasty option while on the go.

i have not noticed any positive effects so far.

a single sheet is enough for a pair of underwear. the soap dissolves quickly, but the water does not feel very soapy, so i am unsure about the cleaning effectiveness. it is best to let the clothes soak in the solution for a few minutes before rinsing.

just as advertised.

this product successfully removed liquid car wax stains from my brandnew car's carpet after six months.

the scale does not seem to travel well. it is inaccurate, fluctuating wildly with each use. one day it says i weigh 60, the next 150. returning it.

these masks are too small unless you have a small child. they are practically useless otherwise.

it removed a grease stain but did not get rid of some dirt. still, it is been great since then.

the fit is nice, and the design reminds me of an old bandanna. however, the lack of a filter slot, the twoply material, and the uncomfortable ear straps left me disappointed. it is better suited for women or children with smaller faces.

perfect for security system use  works as expected.

be cautious when using this  it works well for curling lashes, but make sure to follow the instructions carefully to avoid any accidents.

i appreciate this tablet over capsules  its easy to swallow, has a pleasant spicy scent, and offers great value with 240 tablets in the bottle. it helps me live painfree, which i love.

these shoes caused so much discomfort that i could barely stand, and the return cost was more than the shoes themselves.

easy to use and adds a nice touch to various projects.

great for the price, with soft material and good quality. it does let a little light in through the nose, but its still comfortable for a restful sleep.

i feel like this was a waste of money.

this roller has been incredibly helpful for my husband. his pt therapist used it, and it made a noticeable difference. i hope it lasts for many years.

i wish the labels on the scented candle bath bombs included the specific fragrance details. while the bath bomb did not fizz much, it did color the water without staining, which was a positive.

this product worked great as a filler for pneumatic pressure gauges that needed filling.

although there is no miracle cure for cellulite, this massager set works well for increasing circulation and prepping skin for lotions. both massagers are easy to grip and nonslip, and they provide a relaxing experience.

i understand the need to wear masks, but these inserts do not stay in place. they slide around under the mask, blocking airflow and making it uncomfortably warm. they also worsen glasses fogging. i would not recommend them.

the stick did not click into place as it should, so it came apart while i sprayed. i had to tape it together. it is cheap, but not worth the hassle.

this spray is excellent for eliminating pet odors, especially urine. it works well on various surfaces, and the pleasant orange fragrance is an added bonus.

i really enjoy the scent and the calming effect it provides.

magic erasers are a goto for cleaning in my house. i have used them for years and will continue to do so.

as someone with a long history of allergies, i can confidently say these kleenex expressions tissues are a gamechanger. they do not tear easily, absorb well, and are infused with coconut oil and aloe for a silky smooth texture. they are strong, absorbent, and gentle on the skin, making them my top choice for everyday use.

it worked as expected.

the design is poorly executed, and the tightness needed around the calf compromises circulation. i had to throw it away after one use.

this product eliminated my allergy symptoms completely, and i no longer need claritin or zyrtec.

this massager has been a lifesaver for my broken toe. it provides instant relief after walking, and i miss it when i am not at home.

to avoid scratches on my nails, i use a sandtype grit before applying these. while some scratches are still visible, the shine they provide is amazing, and i cannot stop showing off my nails.

the berta hair straightener works decently for my thick, long hair, but i had trouble with the control buttons being on the inside of the handle. it took longer than expected to get the desired results.

the item was delivered promptly and is exactly as described, matching the details listed.

very soft with a lovely lather. it is slightly smaller than expected, but i quickly adjusted. it held its shape well and i plan to reorder.

a dermatologist once recommended petroleum jelly as a great option for softening and healing dry skin. i appreciate the value of this product and the ease of removing and snapping the top back on.

i love these tissues because when i am sick, they help prevent irritation around my nose. the lotion in them soothes the redness i usually get. they are ultrasoft, absorbent, and the packaging is attractive enough to display. i keep them in every room of the house. whether you are battling allergies or the flu, you will find these tissues a musthave.

i am really happy with this lighter. it works great for lighting candles and i love that its rechargeable, saving me from buying expensive butane lighters. the battery lasts a long time and the price is great. i even bought one for my motherinlaw as a gift.

this product is okay for shortterm use, but if you need something for everyday wear, consider investing in something more durable. the glasses frame and disposable shields did not fit well, and the adhesive did not hold for long.

i really like these filters. they work well, but i am disappointed that the price has increased significantly since i purchased them. they seem to be effective in a house with two dogs and forcedair heating, though.

the product does its job well, and the quality is definitely not cheap, but the price is a bit high for what is essentially a sticker.

these earplugs are simple and inexpensive but work well for what they are. i used them at a concert to protect my ears from extremely loud sound and they did the job.

the vanilla cold brew flavor of this protein is amazing. it is one of the best tasting whey proteins i have tried. i usually add extra ingredients, but this protein is great just on its own. it is refreshing and satisfying, and the large package is a bonus.

this body brush is meant for the body only, unlike more premium models. i have not used it in the shower with batteries because i am not sure the casing would protect the batteries from water.

spirulina is a highly nutritious food that can also help with allergies. it is great for detoxing and packed with chlorophyll, making it a beneficial supplement.

my wife says this product is fantastic. it is durable, uses less makeup than a regular sponge, and is easy to clean. it does not absorb makeup or water, so there is no need to worry about mold. while it feels a little odd at first and takes longer to blend, the result is a smoother, more natural look.

this moisturizer, recommended by my podiatrist, works better than the prescription version for my extremely dry feet. its thicker and creamier, so it does not drip and is easier to apply.

this product does an excellent job cleaning. its hands down the best.

extremely comfortable!

it works as effectively as deet spray.

the product shipped later than expected, but i have no complaints. i have never tried pine pollen before, so i have nothing to compare it to. it arrived earlier than promised.

i like the scent of this product, but the quality control could be better since some cans did not work properly.

this brand was recommended on diy eliquid forums and i am very satisfied with it. its easy to work with, tastes clean, and comes in a secure, safetysealed hdpe bottle. it is also a better deal on amazon with prime than purchasing directly from the manufacturer.

the hard round bit on this knee protector was uncomfortable and actually worsened my knee pain.

perfect for tweens and teens! i cannot see it lasting long for adults, but it is been a great purchase for my 11yearold as we start teaching the importance of clean skin.

these cushions are incredibly comfy and perfect for stadium seating on hard wood seats. we ordered four, and all four of us are very happy with them.

this protein powder is great. i train 45 times a week and it helps with recovery since i never feel sore. i have bought it three times in a row.

getting your omega3s is essential. 

here is what i liked easy to add to teas, smoothies, and other drinks contains 4,250mg of elderberry extract, very potent sweettart flavor that tastes great in drinks what i did not like the bottle has a wide opening, so its easy to accidentally pour more than one teaspoon. i solved this by using a teaspoon measuring cup and have not had issues since. overall, great product, and i continue to purchase it for its antioxidant benefits.

while the clamps were wellreceived by my wife, the chain unfortunately snapped after its first use.

during a visit to my son's home, i witnessed how uncomfortable it was for my daughterinlaw to kneel and reach over the hard tub rim to bathe their baby. i remembered seeing knee and elbow pads designed for this purpose and sent her pictures of a pair i thought might help. she liked the gray, larger size, and when i found a version that was even bigger, i knew it would provide more space for movement. my daughterinlaw is very pleased, especially with the pockets for storing baby items. she did mention that it would be ideal if the elbow pad edges were also padded, but overall, it is been a great purchase. the fact that its washable is a bonus. i believe this would make a thoughtful gift for a baby shower, especially since my son and his wife had not considered this product before. i wish i had something similar when bathing my own children.

this product works greatno leaks and it holds a substantial amount.

this product does not work as expected and fails to remove anything.

i have not noticed any difference, either good or bad, after using this.

the product was very difficult to use and could not even be installed in a benz car.

these fit perfectly and function as intended.

after dealing with achilles tendinitis, i was advised to wear gel heel pads. while shopping in new york, i discovered pedag insoles, which immediately made my feet feel more supported and comfortable. however, the price at the store was high, so i decided to check online and found them at a fraction of the cost. i even stocked up on a few pairs and shared one with my sister, who was equally impressed. these insoles not only support the feet but also help with back and skeletal alignment. they allow me to wear thin, flat shoes without sacrificing comfort. i cannot live without them and will always keep a few extra pairs on hand.

this is my second "real silk" sleep mask, and it meets all my expectations. it is light, breathable, and does not because any discomfort. it blocks out light effectively, offers a comfortable fit, and feels gentle on my skin without dehydrating it. while price may vary, i find the quality of this mask worth it. the silk material is particularly kind to delicate skin, and i appreciate how it feels against my face. i have tried other materials, but i always return to silk. it fits comfortably on my face and blocks out light from every angle. its not too hot, either. overall, i am pleased with my purchase and recommend it for anyone who values highquality silk.

these are durable and keep shoes secure. i use them while dancing in heels.

this product is too difficult to use and i would not recommend it.

i have been using this product for cleaning old, nonglossy dust jackets, cloth boards, and spines. its excellent for surface dirt removal, especially for brightening up cloth boards that have gotten dingy. its not a stain remover, but its great for freshening up dusty books. after a year of use, were reordering because the sponges are still functional, although they have started to crumble after heavy use. for the price, they are a great deal, and well continue to buy them.

this is a great product for securing bandaids and keeping stability tape in place.

this is a precise and effective product that does not pull skin along with hair.

if you enjoy snacking, yacon slices are a tasty option. while i am not a frequent snacker, i bought them for their gut health benefits. yacon contains inulin, a prebiotic that turns into a probiotic, promoting a healthy gut. its a pleasant and beneficial snack.

it is too soon to tell, but i hope this product performs as advertised.

i bought these for a dental volunteer program, and they were perfect for our postprocedure packages. they were affordable and allowed us to continue providing services at a low cost. i am happy with the purchase.

these scissors cut efficiently and perform as advertised.

i used a sample of this to remove adhesive residue from an automotive badge, and it worked effortlessly. the adhesive wiped away with just a paper towel, which amazed me. i have now purchased a bottle, and its been fantastic for removing sticker adhesive. its far superior to other brands i have tried, and i am very impressed.

a great gift for a 21st birthday.

unfortunately, these break very easily with the slightest poke or bend.

this flat iron has been lifechanging for my thick hair, leaving it silky smooth after each use. i highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their hair care routine.

the product leaks soap out of the sponge, which is frustrating.

these glasses do not look or fit well at all, and they are very uncomfortable. the measurements do not match up to my foster grant reading glasses, so id suggest looking elsewhere for better quality.

the bristles of this brush were too short for my needs. while it might work for others, i found it unsuitable for me and returned it.

i love these roller bottles so much that i bought another set. they work great with my essential oils, and despite one incident where the roller ball came out, i simply popped it back in. its been working fine since. i highly recommend these.

i received this as a gift for christmas, but it stopped working after five months. even after cleaning and replacing the batteries, it only worked for 15 seconds before filling with water again.

the foam insert that prevents oil leakage needs to be replaced. otherwise, i love the case and its functionality.

this product is excellent for those with blood sugar issues. it may take some experimentation in cooking and baking, but it is definitely worth the effort.

you can see the quality difference during the pandemic. let us see if prices drop once things return to normal.

works well, but the spring tends to stretch out over time.

i liked the concept, but unfortunately, the bubbled side and bristles were ineffective. the product did not scrub or clean as i expected, and the thick body wash got stuck in the grooves. i did not have much luck with it and would prefer to return it.

this product is sturdy, easy to use, and even picks up small items like a dime.

works better than goo gone. the price for an 8 oz spray bottle is worth it.

this basket is large enough to hold my dogs toys and balls on my back porch.

i use camu camu in my juices and smoothies, and i also bought some for a family member. its a good addition to the cupboard, especially when you feel run down. i have found that adding camu to my diet has helped keep me healthy, even when everyone else is getting sick. this organic product is rich in vitamin c and does not have a sour taste.

this product helps refresh the air effectively, though it does make some noise. it works great in my college dorm where my roommate smokes, and i add essential oils for aromatherapy.

i discovered that this product can be used for more than just its intended purpose, like staying fresh under the bra line or in shoes. the scent is pleasant.

this product works well for large plants.

i think its effective, but its a bit too harsh on my stomach.

its not the same as the old white pearl drops i used to use.

its a good product, but i am unsure why its not safe to ingest.

this product was not what i expected.

it functions well, though i wish the graduation was a bit more visible.

the tea is flavorful and seems to soothe an upset stomach. i opted for the loose tea as it seemed more economical, but it did not work well for me. despite trying three different strainers, the tea leaves passed through and made the drink difficult to enjoy. ill stick to tea bags from now on. too much hassle, not enough time for multiple strainings. hence, four stars.

this product is excellent! it is better than any heating pad i have used before. it is soft and covers my back and shoulders completely. a musthave!

i had covid, and my taste and smell were affected, along with sinus drainage. no other mouthwash managed to eliminate the bad taste or help my sore throat. this one worked wonders, and now i will not switch to another mouthwash.

the scent of tumble is reminiscent of a cheap cologne, not something you would expect or want for a baby. it might be okay for men, but not for infants.

i have tried multiple times, but this scale just does not give an accurate reading. its inconsistent, fluctuating between different weights each time i step on. its somewhat close at lower weights, but still off. do not buy thisits worse than having no scale at all.

the machine takes 5 minutes to deep clean pores, 5 minutes for prep, 5 minutes for hydration, and another 5 for moisturizing. if you are short on time, just do the first and third steps. it is wellmade, but do not use alcohol or oil on the metal head, do not use it in the shower, and keep it away from water.

to my surprise, it works! i used the renu it battery renewer to revive some aaa batteries, and they worked like new after just a few days. it is easy to use. if you go through a lot of aa or aaa batteries, i recommend this product. update i found that if you do not use the renewed batteries immediately, they can leak, so either use them soon after renewal or switch to rechargeable batteries.

this product did not remove yellowing caused by longterm storage.

my youngest had trouble staying asleep at night. after using this, she seems to be sleeping better.

beautifully packaged, making it perfect for gifting. the brush is of high quality and very soft. a great buy for yourself and a friend!

the mountain dew baja blast flavor is greatlemonlime, smooth, and mixes well. the size of the tub was smaller than i expected, though, so the price is not as appealing. but overall, id recommend it. its not too sweet and does what its supposed to do.

it is incredibly easy to use and comfortable, providing relief from pain caused by poor posture. after using it, my posture has improved, and my back pain is lessened. initially skeptical, but it has proven effective.

my husband has a goatee and mustache, so regular masks do not work for him. this one fits much better, staying in place with a long strap that hangs around his neck when he pulls it down. hes very happy with it.

i used this product to break in some 700ho brushed motors. it worked perfectly!

its easy to clean and immediately starts providing pain relief. it relaxes muscles more effectively than the equate rollon pain reliever.

my old handle started sticking, but this replacement works perfectly.

this casual microfiber shower wrap exceeded my expectations. the fabric is soft, absorbent, and very comfortable, perfect for a relaxing shower after a long office day.

my dog broke her toe, and this product was exactly what we needed. we kept it dry and prevented her from chewing or licking her foot, and it worked well.

i initially just wanted to give 5 stars, but since a description is required, here is my moms chocolate chip cookie recipe 4 cubes butter, 2 heaping cups brown sugar, 12 cup white sugar, 2 tbsp vanilla, 1 12 tsp salt, 1 12 tsp baking soda, 3 eggs, 6 cups flour, 1 bag chocolate chips. mix by hand it tastes better. bake at 350f for 911 minutes. enjoy! note this makes a lot, so you might want to halve the recipe.

i normally buy another brand of moringa powder, and this one offers a slightly better price. the flavor and scent are similar to othersvegetablelike, not fruity. its easy to add to smoothies, baked goods, or salad dressings for a veggie boost.

this sound machine would have been great when my son was a baby. the sounds are soothing and not repetitive. its compact, highquality, and has an adjustable timer. the light changes colors, which is a nice touch, and it shuts off quietly after the set time. i highly recommend it.

these shoes may not fit exactly as expected, but they perform very well. i notice less fatigue after long runs or soccer games. overall, they are a good value.

these are not the best reading glasses i have had, but they are serviceable. they are small, do not fit very well, and bending them does not help. however, they do the job, and you get three pairs, which is handy in case one breaks or gets lost. they are decent for anyone in need of cheap glasses.

it hums quietly, and while i am not sure if it is making a difference, i feel like i breathe a bit easier with it plugged in.

i used paul's pail beeswax on my old leather briefcase, and it restored its appearance beautifully. i also used it on a new pencil case, and it made that look great as well. this product is fantastic!

these screwdrivers are exactly what i needed, and the nose cushions are excellent. the rest of the tools will come in handy as needed. id definitely buy again.

i have tried many wheatgrass drinks, and while they are healthy, they taste terrible. this product tastes just like other wheatgrass powdersvegetablelike and unpleasant. its hard for me to recommend it, as i have never felt any positive effects from it.

this hand dryer is hygienic and perfect for company use. its much more efficient than using guest towels. i do not know how i managed without it.

this item is like an extra pair of hands while bathing my son, as he can now sit up in the tub. it is been incredibly useful.

although i do not typically use apple cider vinegar supplements, my son enjoys them. the bottle has a strong vinegar scent when opened. like most gummies, there is a high glucose content to mask the medicinal taste, which may be a concern for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. once you chew them, the vinegar flavor is barely noticeable. as for effectiveness, its hard to quantify, but my son claims they aid his digestion. i trust the solger brand.

the product has a delightful scent and is of excellent quality. it performed well, and i am very satisfied with the purchase!

i cannot recommend this if you dislike a sensation similar to altoids on sensitive areas, as i find it uncomfortable.

i have used probiotics for years and have benefited from them. although this version did not provide any noticeable improvements in probiotic activity, it has one major advantage it tastes fantastic! these probiotics come in round, maltedmilkballsized chews with a waxy coating that prevents melting. the dark chocolate flavor is excellentthough the texture is a bit grainy, it is still very enjoyable. while the cost per dose is higher than capsulebased probiotics, this is the most flavorful option i have tried. taking them feels more like a treat than a task, earning this product a solid 5 stars.

vitamin e oil is effective in preventing scars. i have used it on both my face and arm, and it seems to speed up healing, especially for cat scratches. the oil is thinner than the straight e oil from capsules due to the addition of coconut and jojoba oils, making it easier to apply with the included dropper. this bottle is longlasting, and its reassuring to know its organic and skinfriendly.

the product seems effective.

i have heart issues, particularly extra beats that feel concerning. despite the doctor saying not to worry, i decided to take coq10 three months ago, and i have not experienced an early beat recently. unlike other brands i have tried, this one does not upset my stomach, which is a huge relief. coq10 has benefits for brain fog, but the impact it has had on my heart is far more significant. if you experience stomach discomfort from coq10, i recommend trying this brand!

the communication with the seller was poor. i waited several weeks for my product to arrive and had to contact the seller. when it finally arrived, the pillows were decent but filled with small, lightweight pellets, which were not very comfortable after breast surgery. a softer fill material would have been better.

i liked the flavor, but mixing it without lumps was difficult. i tried mixing with a spoon, but using a blender might yield better results, though that would be more of a hassle.

this little machine is incredible! it does an excellent job and i highly recommend it.

the compact size makes it easy to fit in a carryon bag. its an essential travel item.

very cute and durable. a great purchase!

pros it appears wellmade and works perfectly for shaving my head. the additional attachments are a nice bonus. cons none to mention!

the mop and bucket system is fantastic! the stainless steel mop handle is sturdy and long enough for me i am 5'10". its easy to assemble and comfortable to use, allowing me to clean without worry of the handle breaking. the bucket is compact and does not take up much space. while the microfiber pads perform as expected, the mop systems magnetic feature makes storage easier. overall, i am very impressed.

i appreciate the convenience of gummies since my son cannot swallow pills, and he enjoys the flavor.

this coffee chocolate creamer is excellent! collagen has been a noticeable benefit for my skin and joints. i am very pleased with this product.

this is the best product i have tried that contains all the daily minerals. it tastes great, though i do not recommend the 2.0 peach flavorits unpleasant. if you are taking pain management medications, like percocet or methadone, this product may cleanse you of your meds and because withdrawal symptoms. my pain doctor informed me of this, but otherwise, i highly recommend it.

my daughter purchased it and loves it.

i was hoping for pink necklaces, but the ones i received were purple instead. while they still worked for my gender reveal, i would not recommend them if you specifically want pink and blue beads.

these sanding twigs are a good assortment for sanding metal clay. while i found a larger quantity for a better price elsewhere, the convenience of fast shipping and free delivery made this a worthwhile purchase for me.

i have been using this product for about 23 weeks, and like elyce rose, i had an awful experience. my face tingled, felt pressurized, and i experienced dizziness. this product seems to contain niacin b3, which might be the because. despite being in good health and exercising daily, this product did not give me any energy or keep me alert. instead, i have felt sleepy after taking it. i recommend avoiding this product.

i am not thrilled with these strips. they provide some relief, but the lidocaine pain relief is not as noticeable as other products i have used. the support is not as strong as regular kt tape, and the directions were confusing. its worth trying, but i am not convinced it works better than alternatives.

i have oily skin, and these cushions seem to work better for me than my previous silicone ones. there is slight air leakage, but the straps help keep it secure. i have not had any skin irritation. however, the cushions are not custommade to fit specific masks, so the opening must be cut manually. it would be great if they offered custom fits for popular masks.

this supplement has helped improve my focus and provided a slight mental clarity boost. its easy to swallow and so far has had no negative side effects. it seems like a quality product.

this is a very good product. i used it once and experienced noticeable improvement.

this product works as expected, but it falls short compared to others with larger pouches for feeding tubes. it is now just serving as a backup. it washed fine, but even after using a delicate cycle and a small garment bag, it has started to fray.

i bought this for my motherinlaw, who was looking for something for her dogs. she really liked it and is very happy with her purchase.

our bathroom had a persistent issue with mineral deposits due to our well water, and nothing seemed to workuntil i found these pumice stones. in just a couple of minutes, one of them removed mineral stains that had been on the toilet for years! i wish i would found these sooner. the only issue is with a small spot under the front right edge of the toilet that i cannot quite reach, but overall, i am very satisfied.

perfect size for a purse or backpack.

unfortunately, this did not work for me. i regret not reading the other reviews before buying it.

i recently bought a pair of dress boots that i really liked, but the heels did not have enough grip. these grips solved the problem. i cut them to fit the heels and they have stayed in place despite not being a perfect fit. they are a bit rough, but fine on my nice floors. however, the delivery took over three weeks, so order in advance.

great glasses at an excellent price!

excellent quality! no twigs or unwanted debris, and it worked as expected, even triggering my flashlight when tested.

this tile cleaner is the best i have ever used. the difference it made was amazing, and ill never buy the products from home depot again.

i have been using magnesium citrate for years, but this brand did not work for me. though the pills are smaller, they made me feel nauseous, so i stopped taking them after a couple of days. while they might work for others, they were not effective for me.

just as described!

my son, almost 9, had been wetting the bed every night. it was affecting his selfesteem and causing issues with sleepovers. we tried several methods, including prescription medication and alarms. the wireless alarm we started using worked within weeks. the process became much smoother, with minimal disruptions, and even the sheets stayed dry. i wish i had discovered this sooner!

i love the style of these glasses. the lenses are large, providing a good reading area. they are lightweight and mostly comfortable, though they are a little tight on my head. they do not slip off, and i hope they loosen up with time. the blue and red colors are great, and they work well for phone use, blocking blue light.

lavender is always a great choice! the scent is longlasting and smells amazing.

works wonderfully for bridge work and partials. its perfect for hardtoreach areas. i am glad i purchased it, and taking care of my teeth has never been easier. the item arrived on time and in great condition. ill buy again.

my husband was showing signs of early dementia, and i was desperate to find something to help. after taking relentless improvement lions mane for 23 months, the difference is incredible. hes back to his old self, and i am no longer worried. its been a real gamechanger.

i did not believe all the hype, but after trying this product, i understand why people rave about it. it removed a blood stain from a sheet that had been there for months, something nothing else could do. its pricey, but it works better than anything i have tried.

the black cherry scent is very true to its name and quite strong, so a little goes a long way!

this bottle contains 120 softgels, each with 2000 iu of vitamin d3. the softgels are small and easy to swallow, and they have a neutral taste if you chew them. they are nongmo, which i appreciate.

the pads that cover the drings are uncomfortable under the arms, but other than that, the product works as expected.

my dad loved this! i bought it for him, and he was very pleased.

surprisingly neutral taste for a product with so many green ingredients. it blends well into smoothies without overpowering the flavor. it has some erythritol, but it does not impact the taste much. i feel good adding this to my smoothie for a nutritional boost.

took a while to arrive, but it fits well in the brush handle.

great noise reduction at a bulk price. i highly recommend these for firing range activities.

barley grass has been a wellknown superfood for decades. its packed with nutrients and antioxidants, offering health benefits like immune system support. buying this organic powder in bulk is an affordable way to get these benefits.

i have been using jigsaw health pickleball electrolyte powder for a while now and love it. the individual packets are perfect for onthego use. they mix easily and taste great, providing the electrolyte boost i need, especially in the hot sun during tennis matches.

this probiotic was okay. it helped a bit with bloating, but i did not feel it was extraordinary. i followed the directions as recommended.

this product has been a lifesaver for preventing blisters when running and walking long distances. i have not had blisters since using it, and i hope it continues to help.

my husband loves camay soap, and this is a great way to buy it. it arrived wellpackaged and promptly, and i would definitely purchase it again.

this dryer is exactly what i needed. it works perfectly.

i have been using camphophenique for years, and it remains unchanged in its effectiveness. it is a reliable product for treating minor injuries and brings comfort knowing its always available.

the small size was a bit large for me, but i still found it useful. i wear a size 4 women's shoe and a size 3 child, so it was a tad big.

the packaging is excellent, and the product has no taste or smell, so its easy to incorporate into my food or drink. i am satisfied with this product and will buy it again.

these are the cutest little favor boxes. very elegant and nicely made.

the ulla sometimes does not blink regularly and tends to fall off if bumped or rubbed. it needs a tighter clip to stay in place.

these beads work in a pinch but do not stay cool long enough. they help a little, but my 3 version from target works better.

this product feels great, but it was a bit too large for my hand. i also thought it came with two, but it was only for one hand. still, i am happy with it overall.

the machine arrived promptly, and everything worked as promised. however, the needle hook is difficult to fit onto the machine. once on, it works fine, though. the practice ink is just for testing, so i recommend using a different ink for real skin.

these are the best butt wipes i have tried. they do not have a strong perfume scent, are thick enough for a proper clean, and are durable.

this product is effective at smoothing my nails. i barely need to file them afterward.

i did not expect this to be so thick, considering its a cream. the hyaluronic acid i typically use is more of a lightweight geltype. i may consider repurchasing it if necessary, but its not something i would particularly seek out. i currently use a different hyaluronic acid cream. its quite thick, and while dermatologists usually recommend applying hyaluronic acid on damp skin after cleansing or toning, i felt like i could not layer anything else on top of it. i have a simple skincare routine due to my sensitive skin and retina use. this product also has fragrance, and although it offers good value, i prefer sticking to my current morning routine of cleansing, applying hyaluronic acid, and moisturizing. normally, i would use a vitamin c serum too, but this product does not fully absorb, so i avoid using it together.

a musthave! do not wait for plumbing issues. a simple yet effective tool.

this is great! i blend it into my morning coffee with butter and mct c8. unlike some others, its not overly sweet. the vanilla flavor is perfectnatural and not too sugary. its better than a starbucks vanilla latte! i even add an egg yolk for extra richness.

fantastic product! highly recommend.

this product is good, though i expected more since it is labeled as advanced rather than complete. it felt a bit misleading, but its not worth the hassle of returning.

a perfect stocking stuffer! i bought several of these to gift to friends along with nail stickers. its made of etched glass, so it will last a long time. a highquality nail fileone for home and one for my travel bag. at this price, you could easily get one for everyone on your gift list, and even extras for your purse, car, and office!

i just started using this, and last night was the first time my feet did not hurt all night! i am excited to see the results in the near future!

this worked really well on my dogs paws! its quiet and safe, so i do not have to worry about hurting my pet.

the texture is a good balance between moist and thick, similar to a real brownie. the taste is unique with a distinct sweetness, which might not be for everyone. it has low sugar and more protein than fat, which makes it a good choice for macros. if you are used to compromising taste for nutrition, this will be fine for you. but if you are after an actual brownie, you might be disappointed. personally, i prefer the eat me guilt free nutty monkey brownies, as they provide a better snack without affecting your macros.

these are your typical plastic pill boxes. i use one for my single capsule prescription. at first, i just dumped them in loosely, but i could only fit about 20 at a time. when i organized them neatly, i managed to fit 20. but then i realized that my probiotic capsules were slightly larger, so i could only fit 16 of those. these pill boxes are a decent size for storing overthecounter pills or prescriptions in your bag without needing to carry the full bottle. they are also more affordable than individual travel packs.

the cords are good quality, but the tool they provide for installation was a bit difficult to use.

i do a lot of computer work, and i am not sure if that is the because of my issue. i have been to physical therapy several times, so i know which stretches to do. sometimes, though, my nerves flare up, especially when stressed. before applying the adhesive, i try to find the best spot for it. for my shoulder, i placed it on the back and a bit on top. once the area starts feeling warmer than the rest of my skin, i know its working. i left it on for a few hours today. i also tried it on my leg, where my ankle has been bothering me, and the pain went away after a while. its a process of trial and error to find the right spot. if its too intense, i call my chiropractor.

i was a little disappointed. i already own another air purifier from this brand that works great, so i thought this one would be perfect for the laundrylitter box room. while its a great size and did not scare the kittens, it did not do much for the odor.

i bought this to make homemade fog fluid for my fog machine. i mixed it with distilled water, and i could not tell the difference from the storebought version. it also works well with potassium permanganate for fire startinggreat for science enthusiasts.

i am giving this 4 stars because it smells just like freshbaked brownies! i usually buy from a cheaper vendor, so i did not give it a full 5 stars, but its still good.

this product is just as describedfresh, raw, and organic. the zip closure works well to keep the contents moistureproof. i am adding 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds to my daily diet for osteoarthritis, and its been great so far.

these gloves are excellent! they are comfortable and do not make my hands sweat. i have used them for staining my stairs, washing dishes with hot water, and cleaning the bathroom. they are also great for spray painting, preventing paint from getting on my fingers.

i have bought this product multiple times because its great!

after reading the reviews, i decided to try this laundry detergent, and its amazing! it makes my sheets and towels smell like a luxury hotel. while its too expensive to use on all my laundry, the scent lingers after a week in the linen closet, and its just delightfulnot overpowering, but definitely luxurious. i am so glad i found it!

i like the product, but i paid for a pound 16 oz and received only 14 oz. i weighed it on a scale, and it included the packaging weight. i expected 1 lb of charcoal, but i only got 11 ounces of the actual product.

i really like this productsuch a great concept!

these work well, but they get a bit slippery when wet, and you have to hold them in place. otherwise, they do their job perfectly.

the product functions well.

i love how this wearable breast pump works. my daughterinlaw can discreetly pump breast milk wherever she is. its comfortable to use and does not pinch or hurt. its a great affordable option for ensuring my grandchildren get the breast milk they need.

i just started using this, and i already love it. it soothes the aches and pains in my feet and ankles. my husband, who is diabetic, has cracked and split feet, and this worked wonders for him. ill definitely continue buying it.

this massager brush works wonders on my scalp. the bristles are soft and easy to clean. it works for any hair texture or length, and it feels like a special scalp treatment at home. i highly recommend it.

the product worked as expected.

the battery life was very short, and it did not have enough torque to clean effectively. after the battery died and would not charge after 2 weeks, it ended up in the garbage.

i love this! it removes any baby stain as long as you spray it and let it soak. whether its poo, spitup, food, or anything else, it works every time.

excellent value for the money. it stretches well and is very comfortable to wear during the day or night.

this wrapping paper is high quality and super cute!

its hard to review this without a chemical analysis, but i trust the label, and the price was reasonable.

i had to stop using this product because i had a reaction similar to when fillers are used.

i use this product for diabetesrelated issues, and it works very well as expected. delivery was quick, and ill definitely order from this seller again.

they seem okay, but they are far too small. the packaging shows them being worn by women, but there is no indication that they are not meant for men. they are too small for me to even put on.

finding an eyeglass holder for a man was difficult until i found these. they are made of leather and are high quality. they were easy to attach to the glasses and adjustable for different frame widths. great product, and you cannot beat the price for three in a package.

easy to take, with a pleasant taste. the product comes in an amber glass bottle with a rubber squeeze top. i take it daily for hair growth and ligament protection.

these compression socks are very comfortable. i have worn three pairs in three days, and because they are soft and stretch easily, i am hoping they will last a long time.

i am learning athome beauty regimens for healthy skin and a beautiful scalp, and i am so happy i got this. the comb helps with circulation, and the device reduces blemishes, dark spots, blackheads, and large pores. it boosts cell metabolism and helps slow down skin aging.

i searched for a fish oil that is easy to use, and this one works perfectly in my morning smoothie. i do not notice any difference yet, but i hope its working behind the scenes.

a good product.

this sandalwood essential oil offers an excellent aroma. just a few drops in my diffuser was enough to fill my home with a pleasant fragrance. the bottle contains 3.38 fluid ounces, and it comes with a dropper for easy use. the bottle also provides instructions on various ways to utilize the essential oil. i highly recommend this product to friends and family.

wellpriced.

retains the weight for a few moments after stepping off, which i really appreciate.

received this today, and while the instructions suggest pouring the powder directly into your mouth, the fishy taste from the fish collagen is overpowering, and the supposed green apple flavor does not come through. i could barely finish the packet. i plan to mix it with orange juice to mask the taste. i will update my review if i notice any changes.

overall good, though i would prefer a braided chain to avoid leaks.

my skin is sensitive, and after using this facial brush, it felt a bit too harsh for my skin.

absolutely love them! go bears! bought a set for my son too!

the taste is fantastic!

this novelty westiethemed eyeglass stand exceeded my expectations in terms of sturdiness. it is adorable and made the perfect gift for a family member who is a big fan of westies. i am very satisfied with the purchase and would definitely recommend it.

i get inconsistent readings from this scale. i can stand on it in different spots and get completely different weights each time. its not reliable, and i regret buying it. its inexpensive but definitely not worth it. i would recommend spending a little more on something more accurate.

i love how well this works!

larger than i expected, but it will still be useful.

the comb attachments for my hair dryer broke, but these replacements fit perfectly.

a very reliable brand  we keep purchasing more from them.

the quality is lower than the original glasses that came with it, but these will do the job. the light blue color is just as shown in the photo.

a great product with a pleasant scent!

i love how this feels on my face. its very relaxing, and i especially like that it has bluetooth. i connected it to my phone, played music, and relaxed. with four massage modes, a hot compress, and kneading massage, its a great deal compared to other more expensive options.

these are sturdy bags with tie handles, which are crucial for me. i have placed them in bedrooms, offices, and bathrooms, and even use one in the garage for scooping kitty litter. they are very strongafter a week of daily litter scooping, the bag did not stretch or tear at all. i used ecofriendly bags before, and they tore easily. these are perfect for small trash cans and do not have any scent. highly recommend!

these masks are great comfortable, thick, and shipped quickly.

i love the price. i use this with every diaper change for my baby to prevent diaper rash. my baby has a food intolerance, and one of the symptoms is persistent diaper rash. if not for this, i would have been overwhelmed. its been a lifesaver for both of us.

this is by far the best foot file i have used! i highly recommend it.

i really like this wand. it provides relief and comes with several attachments for different uses.

it does exactly what its supposed to do.

these are a perfect fit for the larger shark head attachments, which are harder to find.

i have been using these brush picks for years, and the holder is really convenient for travel.

it has a fresh, light, almost nutty flavor. i can use it for morning oral care without triggering my gag reflex, which can be sensitive. i prefer it over oil pulling with coconut or sesame oil, which never worked for me. using a tongue scraper with this method helps too.

i have dry mouth and tried many products. this natural dentist brand works great with allnatural ingredients, and it does not contain preservatives or artificial coloring. they used to offer a cool mint flavor, but i cannot find it anymore, so i tried this new option. it still works well, though the taste is not as refreshing as cool mint.

solid preworkout! i have tried many over the years, and this is definitely one of the best. definitely worth trying!

very wellmade with excellent service.

the rim lacks padding. should have opted for a higher quality version.

this has had a profoundly positive impact on my life.

these supplements were a lifesaver for my gallbladder. after taking them, my symptoms cleared, and a checkup showed i was stonefree. after pregnancy, my gallbladder started forming stones again, but these helped manage the issue and continue to work wonders! my naturopath introduced me to them, and i am grateful.

excellent quality for the price. i chose this brand due to its costeffectiveness and nutrient content per serving. it helped lower my cholesterol, and after a few months, my levels were perfect. my health team was impressed. i will be buying again.

i liked these glasses initially, especially the visibility through the holes, but i worried about uneven tanning around my eyes. they take up more space than regular tanning bed glasses and tear easily, but given the number in each roll, that is not a big issue. i stopped using them before determining if they caused "raccoon eyes," but id recommend them if glasses are bothersome.

a great product! this pill case is ideal for people who need daily vitamins or medications. the compartments are large enough for my medications, and the labels are easy to read. its also perfect for travel.

tried this in coconut carrier oil for psoriasis but did not see much effect. however, it seems effective for other uses.

took a while to adjust to the routine of taking this every night, but now that i have gotten used to it, ill keep using it. it has helped regulate my system!

this jinri hair dryer is one of the best i have owned. its powerful, dries my hair quickly, and has adjustable heat and speed settings. its lightweight and easy to use, plus the red color matches my decor perfectly. highly recommend this affordable quality hair dryer.

this product eliminated dog smells from my room, which others had noticed. i run it during the day and turn it off at night. its so effective, i am buying another one for the kitchen and may try it in the camper as well.

despite squishing them to fit, these earplugs did not block out enough noise, especially loud snoring, and they were not comfortable for my small ears.

the shoe inserts are simple but effective. they relieve discomfort from wearing high heels. i was concerned they would make my shoes tight, but they are surprisingly comfortable. they do make the shoes a little tighter, though, so sizing up might help. one downside is that the foam shows with opensided shoes.

this prescriptionstrength fish oil has been great for both my husband and me to manage cholesterol. highly recommend!

exactly what i needed, works great.

comfortable to wear and supports better posture without being uncomfortable.

this portable sound machine offers a variety of sound options, noise levels, and a timer. its relaxing as background noise while reading or doing chores.

for the price, these are surprisingly effective at removing tough stains. they do not irritate my sensitive skin, and i love the fresh scent. they leave my clothes bright, and ill definitely be purchasing more.

functions exactly as expected.

i have not used this consistently enough to see results yet.

looking forward to making some fun halloween projects with this!

this ear thermometer is incredibly easy to use and fast. it gave an accurate reading without making my daughter squirm, and ill never use anything else again. plus, my trekkie husband enjoys calling it a "phaser!"

works as expected for balance improvement in my husband with parkinson's disease.

so glad this product is available! great taste, blends easily into my smoothies, and i love the green color. definitely satisfied!

this thermometer seemed inaccurate. it showed a lower temperature on the forehead than the rectal reading, which was concerning.

amazing product!

my wife uses this for pain relief after injuring her vertebrae. it works well for her.

the soap sheets worked well for cleaning my black trousers. just remember to use dry fingers when pulling them out, and its best for small loads like those in a hotel sink.

this product helped significantly with my hemorrhoids. the seat is deep enough for comfort, and it folds flat for storage. no hose or spray attachment, but it was not needed.

unlike flimsy guest towels, these are durable, absorbent, and feel substantial. they are great for postwash use!

fast delivery and highquality producthoping it lasts a long time.

my daughter loves the package, and it is perfect for new surferseasy to glide and smells amazing.

i did not enjoy the taste of this brand after switching, so i will not purchase it again.

this item fits well, and the quality is impressive.

the tens machine provided muchneeded relief for my neck pain. i use it regularly for comfort, and its been effective at alleviating discomfort without medication. the setup was a little confusing, but the manufacturer added a helpful video, though it would be better with captions.

fast shipping, and the flavor was great with almond milk.

i bought this for my church. while i like it, it would be better if it included more than one key.

i have tried more expensive options, but this one works just as well. my only gripe is that it changes directions every 60 seconds, but overall, its a solid product with excellent heat.

great value for the price! i wish it could run on batteries, but the car adapter is a nice touch. id prefer a longer house cord.

the product arrived quickly and seems to be a great item with no issues.

these toothpaste squeezers are a gamechanger! they help get every last bit of product out of the tube. i also use them on other squeezable items. easy to use and effective. ill be ordering more.

after seeing this mattress advertised on youtube, i bought it to add comfort to my office chair. its been a lifechanger, and now i am considering buying the mattress, especially after testing it with a friend.

unfortunately, this product interferes with my thiamine absorption, so i had to stop using it.

the germguardian uvc sanitizer works great in removing kitchen odors and air purifying. it is quieter than the older version i have used, and maintenance is minimal. just remember not to look directly at the uv bulb to protect your eyes.

this portable peddler is quiet, easy to move, and perfect for multitasking while reading or watching tv. its lightweight and easy to clean around, making it an ideal addition to any home.

this flat iron works great! it heats quickly and leaves my hair silky and smooth. the rubber end protects my fingertips, and i am so glad i bought it.

i was pleasantly surprised by the lavender scent when cleaning my yoga mat. it lifted my spirits and cleaned well, removing a lot of dirt. worth the price!

i was honestly surprised by the size of this sandalwood oil bottle. usually, i end up using diluted versions due to the high cost of santalum album, but this one is a game changer. the fragrance has a warm, comforting quality to it, and it works perfectly when diffused on its own or paired with vanilla essential oil for a soothing aroma. the packaging is also greatarrives in a sturdy box with a secure lid to prevent spills, and it includes a dropper for convenient use. i am glad i found this; i use sandalwood often in my diffuser to unwind during the evenings. the rebecca review

the bristles are incredibly soft! perfect for a gentle exfoliation experience!

the pillowcase feels so smooth and luxurious! it is satin, and thanks to the hidden zipper, it stays securely in place. i used it for a nap and slept soundly, plus my long hair was not a mess afterward. the quality is topnotch. i always ensure i thoroughly test a product before reviewing it, as i understand how frustrating unreliable reviews can be. as an amazon customer, i know the importance of providing honest feedback. i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my genuine review. i aim to provide all relevant details rather than exaggerate the product's quality. if my review was helpful, please consider voting for it. thank you!

i have tried many supplements before, but this one truly works. it effectively helped me completely empty my bowels, which is a huge relief after struggling with ibs for two decades. unfortunately, it is been out of stock for a while, and when i tried a different brand, it did not compare at all. i am really hoping this product comes back soon!

some replacements just do not match the original quality, but these come close to the oem fit, and i am very satisfied.

you do not need to have arthritis to appreciate how easy this can opener is to use. my 87yearold mom had trouble with the old can opener, but this one is effortless for her. the extra blades are also a nice bonus.

this backpack is spacious enough for my husband's scooterperfect fit!

these sunglasses are not polarized and feel quite flimsy.

it works just as describedheats up in under 2 minutes and stays warm for 2030 minutes. the heat release is gentle and gradual, making it great for relieving period cramps, back pain, and more. the size is perfect for use on various body areas. packaging was solid, and shipping was quick. highly recommend. thanks!

this is the 31st bp monitor i have tried, and while it is basic, it performs reasonably well. most monitors give similar readings, and this one is a few points lower than some of my others, but still within an acceptable range. it stores up to 90 readings per user in two user modes. after taking a reading, it shows the systolic, diastolic, and pulse. it averages the results after three successful readings, but the average is not clearly marked, unlike some other monitors that show "average." there is an irregular heartbeat indicator, and the cuff fits most arm sizes. the included power options are either four aaa batteries or a usb type c cable. the time settings are in 24hour format. it has voice assistance, though the accent is quite strong. overall, it is a decent monitor that is easy to use after reading the manual. if you are looking for a reliable, budgetfriendly bp monitor, this could work for you.

cleaning the inside of the carafe has proven difficult with just a bottle brush. despite following the provided instructions, i was able to remove most stains, except for those on the upper inside edge where the brush cannot quite reach.

the product stays on my lips rather than absorbing. the rose scent is overwhelming, and the taste reminds me of what i imagine potpourri would be like.

this does not do a thorough job of cleaning teeth. after using it, my teeth do not feel as clean as when i use an electric toothbrush. the waterpik attachment lacks pressure, and i regret not spending more to get the waterpik toothbrush combo.

i really like the phiten single braid necklace. it suits me much better than the tornado style, and i notice improvements in my sleep and overall healing.

i have used duracell batteries for years without issue. they last a long time in any device and have great shelf life. even when stored for a long period, they remain effective. these outperform any generic or offbrand batteries i have tried.

i cannot believe i did not purchase one of these sooner. its a purchase i am proud of, and anyone still inflating balloons manually should definitely get one. i have not figured out how to use the plastic balloon tie tool yet, but i am sure there is a tutorial online.

this solution cleans significantly better than traditional methods.

it might seem expensive, but it is worth every penny. start with one tab, then increase to four a day, and you will definitely feel the benefits. my husband and i are both taking it.

this is my second and final purchase from this brand. while the glasses do block blue light, one pair lost a nose protector within a week, and another pair chipped with normal wear. these replaced my old pair, which had started losing tint after six months.

i am really happy with this product! its fantastic, and i highly recommend it. the shipping was fast, and the quality is excellent. thank you so much, rosemyst instant magic! i am thrilled with the results.

this veganfriendly toothpaste has a mild peppermint flavor. it does not have the sharp sting that some other brands do, which may help with sensitivity. after using it for a week twice a day, i noticed slight whitening, but nothing dramatic. it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth smooth. the active ingredient is sodium fluoride at 0.24, the same as in many other whitening toothpastes. there is a fair amount of air in the tube, which requires some pressure to release the first squirt. overall, its a decent toothpastemild, slightly whitening, but a bit pricey for what it is.

i just received this scale today. it is very userfriendly and provided an accurate weight reading. id love to buy another for my family to use around the house.

i find it a bit hard to remove from my finger, but it seems to do its job well.

black cumin seed oil is a supplement with various health benefits. this one is of high quality, packaged in the you.s., and the company is womenowned. i have been taking black seed oil for over a year in various forms. the oil itself has a difficult taste, so capsules are much easier. i am glad to have this capsule form, as it may be the purest option. i do believe my health has improved since i started using black seed oil, and i am happy with this product.

definitely worth the purchase! it is a great product.

these are exactly what i was searching for to pair with my opentoe ankle heels. they adhere securely while maintaining a soft feel.

no one should receive a product that is dirty or damaged, especially when its something personal. the strong odor and the small opening at the top prevent a proper seal. i deal with significant bowel issues and regularly buy affordable enemas that work much better than this one.

works wonderfully! arrived quickly, and i absolutely love the color.

i was not sure how to best use this at first, but i have figured it out. the essential oil rollon is fantastic for soothing itchy bug bites and skin irritations. after applying it to a large, itchy welt from a bite, the itch disappeared almost immediately, and by the next day, there was no trace of the bite. it smells great, too!

i have been using this for nearly two months and have not noticed any improvement in my tinnitus. it is probably best to save your money.

this product is a lifesaver for my long hair. nothing else works like this does. so glad i found it on amazon!

i have not noticed any significant difference while using this product. the taste is okay, though.

this product works wonderfully!

i previously used white vinegar to clean my dishwasher as it was cheaper. however, vinegar can damage and void warranties. these tablets clean the dishwasher excellently while leaving behind a pleasant scentsomething vinegar does not do. i follow the recommendation of using them in an empty dishwasher. other brands suggest their tablets can be used while the dishwasher is full.

these are not a miracle cure if your diet consists mainly of processed foods. however, if you focus on eating whole, natural foods, they can be beneficial, especially after taking antibiotics or when your body feels off. by supporting your microbiome with these and a natural lifestyle, we can start reversing the spread of western diseases.

these are good for light use during cooking or as a refresher. they are not the most absorbent, but they work well as a liner and can help ease cramps to some extent.

the taste is decent, but they arrived melted and discolored. also, i did not realize they were fruitflavored.

as mentioned in the headline, after taking it with food, i felt less bloated in my stomach and face. it also made me feel more energetic and focused. ill definitely be buying a larger bottle. after using it for a month, i recommend taking it with food or a small snack to avoid an upset stomach. its not painful, just a bit warm.

this works great, though i wish the tube had more product in it so it could last longer.

these are soft and comfortable, even when scrubbing hard. however, i did find it cheaper to buy them in a store.

i was initially skeptical about this product, as many fivestar reviews can be misleading. however, this product absolutely lives up to its reputation! i have struggled with ingrown hairs, razor burn, and the annoying postshaving itch. this product eliminates all of that. its milky rather than foamy, and a little goes a long way. my skin feels amazing, and i have not had any issues. highly recommend!

it works well and is easy to use.

so far, its working fine. the short handle means i can only use it on my neck, though it almost reaches my lower back. it seems powerful, and it would likely work great for professionals like barbers or hairdressers. i just wish i had someone to use it on me!

this is total junk. the size they sent could have fit someone much larger. i tried to modify it, but its still a huge waste of money.

i really like the textures and flavors.

the soap, box, and packaging were all covered in soap flakes. the box was falling apart, and i had to store the bars in ziplock bags. definitely not giftworthy. i am not sure if its normal for soap to be covered in flakes, but this was not what i expected.

this lotion made my skin even drier. no matter how much i applied, it just made my skin feel worse.

i ordered the wrong type, and it did not work as expected.

i work nights and sleep during the day, so its difficult to sleep with sunlight, even with lightblocking drapes. i have used silk masks, but they are uncomfortable and do not fit well. the eye cups on this mask help it rest comfortably on my face. the adjustable band is a great featureloosening it helped with a sinus headache. i even napped with it, and the eye cups kept it in place. a solid investment, and i am happy with it so far!

the air purifier operates quietly and effectively cleans the air.

i mistakenly ordered the wrong size, but it is been a learning experience.

the fit is snug, and the optical clarity is excellent. these are perfect for motorcycle riding as they provide a complete seal around the eyes, and the builtin readers are a convenient bonus.

discarded the item.

these tissues are my top choice! i prefer the smaller cubes over the larger boxes.

the plastic components made this difficult to use, and the build quality felt subpar.

this mask significantly increased comfort during use. i wore it for several hours on a plane and barely noticed it. to ensure a proper fit, make sure the mask is pulled down over the chin. while the design works well, clipon masks might be more convenient if you are frequently putting the mask on and off.

i initially bought these magnifying lenses for detailed painting, but i soon realized how versatile they are. they are perfect for any task requiring closeup work like removing splinters, trimming ingrown toenails, or even reading fine print. i keep them nearby for everyday use. they are incredibly helpful and highly recommended, even for those with good eyesight.

easy to install and remove.

treated my tank with this product and observed positive results.

i am a fan of soothing wellness essentials' carrying cases! i initially bought one for 96 oils, and after liking it, i went for the larger version. the inserts protect the oils, and the pockets inside the top are a great touch. the case is easy to carry and store, and it looks fantastic!

while this mask is comfortable, it does not fully block light. it reduces about 80 of sunlight in a welllit room, but for full darkness, it might not be sufficient.

these had a strong gasoline smell even after washing. the soap inside did not lather well. very disappointing.

the product has no fragrance, and the size is smaller than expected.

this is more rubbery than spongelike, and i did not find it useful for dishes or other tasks.

this product is useful depending on your needs. while it does not completely replace traditional cleansing methods, it offers a rinsefree option with minimal water required. it lathers lightly and is effective enough for cleaning, though it may not be as refreshing as other products. its good for situations like camping or when there is no access to hot water. the term "waterless" in the title could be misleading.

the clip catcher is a great feature! it eliminates the need to go outside or hover over the sink while clipping nails.

includes a bottle brush for cleaning and a comfortable rubber seal that ensures a good fit. this is ideal for emergency situations.

these seem to fit most of my heels and work well for their intended purpose.

after using these for two months, i have found them helpful for my torn rotator cuff. they assist with pain relief and exercises, and i am avoiding surgery for now. i plan to continue using them for another month and will update my review.

after doing a lot of physical labor, i have found this product helps alleviate soreness and boosts my endurance. the taste is decent, and blending it gives the best results. i sip on it throughout my workday.

the powder is fine, flavorless, and blends easily in smoothies. the serving size is small, so it should last a long time.

these are great for a quick snack when hunger strikes before a main meal. they have a mild taste, and the texture is soft with a little chew. they are easy to eat and provide a satisfying option when i am on the go.

i think dreft detergent is fantastic. the scent is lovely, and it leaves clothes soft and smelling great. i also appreciate the new packaging with an easytouse spout.

highquality loofah that works well with both body washes and bar soap. it exfoliates the skin effectively without causing irritation. the shipping was quick and secure, and i am satisfied with my purchase. ill buy again when needed.

while the quality is decent, i will continue to prefer huggies wipes for my needs.

these are functional, though not fancy. the foam pad does not absorb lotion, which is a plus. although i do not struggle with reaching, i can understand how others might find it challenging. overall, i am satisfied with the product.

these fiber gummies are fine. each serving provides 5g of fiber, which is decent but not remarkable. its worth noting that a serving requires three gummies, so a 60count bottle only lasts 20 days. the taste is okay, with a berrylike flavor, but there is 3g of added sugar per serving, which seems a bit high. the texture is firm and somewhat rubbery, and it sticks to my teeth, which i find annoying. the fiber is sourced from chicory root, which is typical for fiber gummies. i do appreciate that it uses natural flavors and colors, though. the country of manufacture is not listed on the bottle, which may indicate its not made in the you.s. considering taste, formulation, serving size, cost, and ease of use, i rate this product as average.

a small investment in this device could potentially save thousands of dollars in dui penalties and possibly even lives. while i am not a regular drinker, i find this oasser breathalyzer breath tester convenient for occasional use. it even comes with a window punch, making it a handy tool for my car.

after using the docapole 6inch scrub brush with extension pole for the first time, i was able to clean mildew from a section of vinyl siding in under five minutes, a task that used to take me much longer with a ladder and sponge. it was also effective in cleaning hardtoreach areas around my attic vent. this tool is lightweight, easy to maneuver, and does an excellent job. i highly recommend it.

i prefer a stiff soapy back brush in the shower for exfoliation and cleaning, but this product did not meet my expectations. the bristles are too soft, and the material lacks the necessary exfoliating effect. it felt more like using a rubbery belt than an effective back scrubber.

the image featuring a woman holding doughnuts was unnecessary and felt stereotypical. while i understand the product is aimed at plussized women, this approach feels a bit offensive. despite this, the product itself works fine for what i needed.

the bath bomb was nice, though it arrived broken.

i love my leather club chair, but my dogs, especially my energetic pittie, had caused some wear and tear. after applying this leather conditioner, the chair looks amazing again. the application was quick and easy, and the product goes a long way. i highly recommend it, and its safe for pets as well.

this bracelet is beautiful and fits my small wrist perfectly. it remains shiny and untarnished, and i am very happy with my purchase.

i love it. sitting at my home office all day, this product has made a noticeable difference.

after researching various canes, i opted for this one. at first, the extra features seemed unnecessary, but now they prove to be quite practical. its the best value for the price, though i wish the handle was offset for more comfort over long periods.

i usually buy recycled tissues, but during cold season, we end up with at least two boxes of these. unfortunately, they can cause skin irritation around the nose and upper lip.

this product is okay, but i would recommend getting a much larger size for better value.

the price feels too high for what you get.

i appreciate the bulk packaging, and so far, the product performs similarly to other, more expensive options. i am happy with the purchase.

i love disposable eye steam masks for dry eyes, and this electric version is great for longer use. the heat options and timer are useful, and its perfect for relaxing before sleep or during an afternoon break. the lavender insert is a nice bonus, and there is also a cold pack available for added comfort.

i tried this brand as a substitute for my usual one, and while i prefer the other, this product works fine.

my son enjoys it. the floss is just the right thickness, though i wish there was not a fruity scent. still, i can overlook that and would give it 5 stars.

this fish oil significantly lowered my cholesterol and triglyceride levels in just a couple of months, and best of all, there is no unpleasant aftertaste. i highly recommend it.

while the foot soaking bucket looks fine in the picture, its cheap plastic construction becomes evident in practical use. it deforms when filled with water, especially with hot water, and the handles feel flimsy. however, its still functional, and it fits my feet well. overall, its adequate but not exceptional.

this supplement is great for my needs.

this aloe spray helped relieve itchy skin caused by insect bites and stressrelated rashes. its easy to use, with a light scent, and the mist is simple to spray. its especially useful for hardtoreach areas and provides soothing relief.

i received this item quickly and tried it once. it worked well and was easy to clean, but it did arrive looking slightly used with a scratched and blurred button print. i also had concerns about the shaving head. after six months of regular use, one of the shaving petals fell off while cleaning it. i had to buy another one from a different brand due to quality issues.

the product worked for me. it helped my tooth stay in place for a day, which was enough for me to feel confident in front of others.

this product worked as intended. i would recommend it.

i have found these larger interdental brushes to be essential for my dental hygiene. this is the only brand that offers them, and i am satisfied with the quality.

i could not detect the scent.

i tried using these insoles in new work boots. while they started off tacky, they did not stay in place well and eventually became loose, rolling up on themselves. after a few hours, they became difficult to unroll without tearing. i would not bother returning them as it was not worth the hassle.

the measuring cup with an easy pour spout is a convenient feature. its quick and simple to use.

these are advertised as new oem parts, but they cut as if they were poorly refurbished. i was unimpressed and will not buy them again.

these tasted strange. while not exactly bad, the texture is like eating peas that resemble matzo crackers. its a bit confusing for my taste buds. maybe ill get used to them over time.

these were perfect for a state fair project i was working on.

it works well for me, especially when my stomach is upset. the cinnamon smell is pleasant.

i am happy with this product. it arrived on time and as described, and ill be buying again.

it worked as expected and did the job well.

this plate is great for my elderly father, helping keep food from being pushed off. i just wish it were a little larger and less expensive, but i am glad i purchased it.

i found the digestive advantage dark chocolate probiotic chews to taste unpleasant. i could not manage to finish them, so i am not a fan.

one piece of this item worked well, but the other broke on the first use.

this mitt is fantastic. it lathers well with minimal shower gel and exfoliates like no other. its relaxing, fits well, and even has a wrist strap to keep it in place. the hole at the end is great for hanging it.

i transferred this product to a glass jar with a sealed top. its easy to use and has a slightly sweet accent when stirred into my morning coffee. it combines well with a multib vitamin and probiotic for optimal effectiveness.

the product contains mycelium grown on sterilized grain usually brown rice. if you see a product claiming to be freezedried myceliated brown rice, its essentially groundup brown rice mixed with mushroom root extract.

i recently purchased this brush for my husband, and he immediately tried it out. he mentioned that the bristles were very soft and easy to use for applying dry oil. it worked smoothly, turning easily in the oils and was simple to apply to his beard. afterward, his beard felt softer and looked less rough. it keeps his beard feeling soft and youthfullooking.

i ordered the pure science dgl licorice 500mg and received it quickly. the bottle was sealed with a quality control seal and an inner protective seal. the recommended dosage is one capsule daily, preferably with meals, or as directed by a healthcare provider. my daughter suffers from chronic hyperacidity and stomach burning. in the past, she used antacids like tums or prilosec, but these only temporarily neutralize stomach acid. while acidreducing medications are commonly used, they do not address the root because, which is often a reduction in stomach mucus production. the lack of protective mucus causes the stomach lining to become vulnerable to acid damage, leading to discomfort. unlike medications that reduce acidity, licorice specifically dgl helps promote the production of protective mucus, improving the stomach lining. so far, my daughter has had no side effects, and the licorice seems to be of good quality. i would recommend it.

i have short, thin lashes, and this curler works beautifully for me!

i was skeptical at first, but this product works as described. there was no smoke smell, even after i tested it by smoking outside the car and blowing the smoke inside. i am unsure of the filters lifespan, but ill find out soon enough.

i have eczema and psoriasis on my fingers and needed protection. however, i am sensitive to latex and using latex finger cots is uncomfortable. these fabric ones seemed like a great alternative  reusable, washable, and easy to store. however, the fabric is too rough for my skin, causing irritation, and sometimes it feels too tight or too loose. while this might work for others, its not right for me.

i was pleasantly surprised by this products taste. it is not overly sweet, unlike many similar products that use stevia or monk fruit and have an aftertaste. the sweetness comes naturally from the organic berry powders, and i love the inclusion of superfoods like goji, maqui, acai, and chaga mushrooms. the product is organic except for the collagen peptides, which is important due to the pesticide concerns around berries. i add it to yogurt, oatmeal, or mix it with liquid. it has a slightly sweet, slightly earthy flavor, which pairs well with unsweetened yogurt and nuts. at only 25 calories per tablespoon, its perfect for a healthy breakfast. i also feel more energized and in a better mood since incorporating it into my routine. ill definitely purchase it again.

i had an issue with my order, though it was not the sellers fault, and they still resolved it for me. the vitamin e oil is wonderful. i use it on my face after showering at night, and i love it.

my nails are much thicker now.

i have been increasing my intake of antioxidants and polyphenols, and although i cannot confirm their exact effects, i make sure to rotate them into my daily supplements. i now prioritize products made in the usa, whether it is for me or my dogs. i have had no issues with these and will continue using them.

this traction device is excellent. it is very useful and made with highquality materials.

while this product may help remove water from your ears, it can be quite painful. i tested it on myself first before giving it to the kids, and it was uncomfortable. i will not use it again.

my husband really likes this beard balm. after trying the starter sample, he was impressed enough to buy the fullsize version. i enjoy the light, subtle scent, and while it is a bit pricey, it lasts a long time, so its worth it. the guitar pick included for scooping is a thoughtful addition.

these pads are definitely worth it. you get a lot more than you will use in a lifetime. unlike other brands, they do not lose their shape quickly. they are durable and take around two months to need replacing. plus, they are large enough to ensure your lashes do not get caught in the curler.

i did not check the size before purchasing, and they turned out to be huge! however, they are wellmade and quite beautiful.

we keep these around for the workers on our home improvement project. they love them because they fit easily over their boots.

my son loved these!

i really appreciate the clip that allows me to attach the case to my safety vest. its all about safety.

unfortunately, this product did not work for me.

i was hoping these extenders would make it easier to take my mask off and let it hang from my neck, but they did not serve that purpose. they are difficult to adjust, and once i managed to get the straps on, they kept shifting, causing the mask to fall off. i cannot use them as i intended and would not recommend them.

if your lures have a strong odor, this soap might help. its a great way to wash them and increase your chances of a successful catch.

the champagne glasses i received started deflating, which was disappointing.

i love that this filament comes with a protective cover and the little bumps on the foot to show you where to use it. great value overall.

i ordered the number 2 balloon, but it did not come with an inflation tube like some others. when deflated, it measures around 43 inches, but once inflated, it only reached about 33 inches, which was a letdown. the pink color is beautiful, though, and it has loops for easy hanging. the deflation process took a bit of time, but the air smelled like nail polish.

this item was not quite what i expected, and it seems a bit cheap, but it does work.

these glasses are useful for spotting stains, and they do not strain my eyes.

australian bush flower essences are reliable products of known quality, and i have had great experiences with this distributor. the shipping is fast, and its often easier to get these products here than in australia! the stock essence is economical, and you can dilute it yourself for more bottles.

i am not entirely convinced that this lotion keeps the bugs away as well as id like, especially for my son who tends to get bitten a lot. while it works in some situations, it does not act as a shield. id recommend it for general outdoor use but not for more intense outdoor activities. it also does not have the overpowering smell that some other products do.

i bought this to use with an edible tincture, and it works really well. a little goes a long way.

this product does not mix as well as others i have tried, as there is always a stubborn blob of powder that will not dissolve. the watermelon flavor is much better than the mojito flavor. in terms of performance, it gives me the energy boost i need for workouts, though i cannot say its noticeably better than other brands.

the inside coating of our cover started coming off after only a few weeks, and all the plastic clips broke. it leaked, and the seller refused a refund after 30 days. i bought a 15 cover from another seller that has held up much better.

we use this to track my daughters water intake due to potz syndrome. it fits all the glasses we have tried it on, and the light is bright enough to remind her to drink but not too bright to be distracting. its been very helpful.

this scale works better than the 60 one i replaced. its very accurate.

i like doing my part for the environment, and this brand is great for that. i brought these cups to serve cocktails at a 4th of july party and felt much better about it compared to using solo cups.

i bought these syringes to administer medication to my dogs, and they have been fantastic. they are easy to use and come individually wrapped. the syringes are sturdy, clearly marked, and wellmade. the price is very reasonable for the value.

this brush cut the time i spend straightening my hair by 50. the temperature and steam settings are adjustable, and the iron arrived very quickly.

i love the compact cube design of this air purifier! its perfect for small spaces, and the white noise it creates is soothing. its easy to use and includes an extra filter. one concern is that there is no way to purchase replacement filters yet. this affects the overall value for me, so i deducted one star. otherwise, it works very well and comes with clear instructions.

i have read a lot about this cleaner online, and its great. i also make a homemade paste with baking soda, vinegar, and dawn, which works wonders!

the baggies are great, but the electrodes inside are of poor quality. they are sticky but do not adhere well to the skin, and i had to use tape to keep them in place. they also leave a sticky residue, which is very frustrating.

this is a great replacement for my current unit, and it was easy to install.

my husband and i both broke our placards, and these covers have allowed us to continue using them. they are definitely worth the money.

i bought one of these for my bad ear, and i was so impressed with the sound quality, even in a noisy store. i bought a second one, and now my hearing is great with both. these are much better than other products i have tried, and i am extremely satisfied.

these 12 large jars of moisturizing petroleum jelly are amazing for dry skin. i use it after a bath, but its very greasy, so you have to be careful not to stain clothes. the scent is a bit strong after a while, but the product works well.

these watch pins are inexpensive, but they do not last long. the stem is too short, and the first pin i installed fell out after a day. the installation tool is helpful, but i am now looking for better quality pins with longer stems.

this product is small, quiet, and stylish. i am not sure how effective it is, but i am hopeful that it works.

these are terrible quality, and they broke within a couple of days. definitely not worth the money.

i was happy with the scent and cleaning power when i used this product once, but the spray mechanism stopped working properly during my second use. it just dripped out instead of spraying. i could not fix it, so i cannot give it a full rating.

these cotton gloves are a great value, and i use them all night with my hand lotion. they are comfortable and durable, and since they are reusable, they will last a long time.

i set this up on an amazon subscription, but it was out of stock on the first two deliveries, so i decided to stop the subscription. the product quality is excellent, though, so now i just order it when i need it.

this is just what i needed!

these are fantastic! i wish i had found them years ago. the only downside is the powder inside, which my sensitive skin does not always tolerate well.

these tissues are not the softest, but the round packaging is perfect for fitting in car cupholders. they come out smoothly, and the design is very practical.

this set of protein powder packets is perfect for onthego. they mix well with water or in a smoothie, and the flavor and texture are excellent. they provide a healthy snack when you need it.

these heel protectors are perfect for wearing with tighter shoes. they offer some cushioning and relieve the pain from plantar fasciitis. they also come with a ball for massaging your feet, which is a nice touch.

the pros of this product are that it is organic, nongmo, easy to digest, and does not because flavor burps. the downside is that the tablets are large and may be difficult to swallow without breaking them in half. i am not sure if they contain curcumin, though.

i do not understand why this company focuses solely on pumpkin seed oil for mens issuesit has a lot of other benefits, including for arthritis and skin health. its high in beneficial fatty acids, but consult with your doctor if you have blood pressure concerns.

i love it! it really works!

i love how long this is but its not bulky when folded.

i had high hopes for these, but unfortunately, they did not deliver. i was not expecting much from the socalled "copper" material, but i thought they would at least offer some stability or compression. sadly, they do not stay up, and any movement causes them to slide down my legs. not a good purchase overall.

disappointed with this product. i was really hoping it would help stretch my shoes, but it did not have any noticeable effect.

sometimes, shoes just are not comfortable, especially when the base under the ball of the foot is too thin. these pads do offer some relief, though i did notice they made my shoes feel a bit tighter. they stay in place for the most part, but can shift if you are not careful. ill keep testing them with other shoes and update my review if anything changes.

unfortunately, this product did not work for me. instead of transferring perfume into the bottle, it ended up all over me, which was a huge letdown. i have used similar products before, but this one did not perform as expected.

this product worked as expected and did the job without any issues.

the containers are very sturdy, and each one comes with a small pocket to fill, which is a nice touch. the design is functional, although i noticed that the pill is not fully sitting at the bottom of the container.

my husband loves this cushion and will not drive without it. its been a real game changer for longer trips, providing comfort for drives over 20 minutes.

i used this product to infuse olive oil and it worked wonderfully. the result was a lovely salve, perfect for use on skin.

this product does a great job of cleaning my ball, which is essential for maintaining its quality.

i bought the clay version of this product, but it does not get very hot and only stays warm for about 510 minutes. honestly, filling a sock with rice works better and stays hot longer.

i have been adding this mix to my coffee for the "bullet coffee" effect. it definitely gives me more energy and curbs my appetite, but you will need a blender to mix it well  a spoon will not cut it.

very satisfied with this purchase. it met all of my expectations.

i am excited to wear these after halloween! hoping they will bring some extra cheer to my wardrobe.

my guests absolutely loved using these for opening bottles and pushing buttons without physically touching them. a great little item for added convenience.

these pads are helpful for foot pain, especially for the ball of the foot. i have even added them to my custom orthotics, and they do relieve some of the pain. however, they tend to move around a bit, and i have noticed they might roll up when i put my shoes on. overall, they help, but the fit could be improved.

i like the scarf, but it does not stay in place as well as i thought it would. its still comfortable, though.

we go through a lot of chickpeas for snacks, and they are perfect for road trips or school lunches. just remember to bring water, as they tend to make you thirsty!

this product is definitely not tobacco, as advertised. it is not a great alternative, and i personally prefer the hookah rocks over this. if you want something better, go for starbuzz.

we like the product for the price we paid, especially since we bought it at open box pricing. however, i am having trouble finding the directions for the remote.

not a good experience. one of the items was completely broken, and the other had scratches on the handle. very disappointing.

this is a great additive to water. it enhances the taste and makes drinking water more enjoyable.

i found this product uncomfortable and it showed under all my clothes. i ended up buying a wider support band for much cheaper, and it was more comfortable and supportive.

i am not sure if this product is effective yet, but one of the two bottles does not even spray, which is disappointing.

i love the smell of this product, and it feels great on my skin.

the wool is thin and matts down quickly. not the best quality for the price.

this product comes wellpackaged and is perfect for gifting. at first, the scent is a bit bland, but after a while, it warms up and becomes more complex. it is not an unforgettable scent, but its subtle enough for everyday wear or the gym.

the product does not snap shut tightly enough, which is a bit of an issue.

any lions fan will love these ziploc bags. they are a little pricey, but living in florida, its hard to find any team gear, so its worth the extra cost.

this case does a great job of protecting my jewelry from dust, keeping everything in good condition.

the scrubber is very soft and lathers my body wash beautifully. there are four in a packet, and i have only used one three times so far, so i cannot say how long they last, but they are a great buy.

i have been using this product for over six months, and its been a game changer for my gums. after using it, my dentist noticed a huge improvement. i no longer experience inflammation or pain, and there is less tartar buildup. i do not need toothpaste or mouthwash anymore; this has it all. it even helps prevent my gums from receding. i am ordering more now.

my hair seems to be improving, or at least that is what my hairdresser says.

i use this spray for my mentally challenged brother, who has accidents. it helps neutralize the odor and keeps the area smelling fresh.

these earplugs are comfortable, but unfortunately, they did not help block out the noise from the highway, which is what i needed them for. they are easy to insert and comfortable for side sleeping, but they do not provide the sound isolation i was hoping for.

these liners are a good value, though they are a bit thicker than i expected. they still work well and get the job done.

this product has great color rendition and is quite bright for its size, though it does run a little hotter than i anticipated.

i got this for my motherinlaw and myself, and we both love it. its long enough to keep our sleeves dry and is super comfortable.

this product works wonders for clearing my stuffy nose. i am very happy with it.

these gloves come in a ziploc storage bag, which is a thoughtful feature. they are soft, lightweight, not too tight, and cotton. plus, they are washable! definitely a fivestar product.

this product has a simple design, but the material is so soft and provides great sound dampening. its perfect for road trips and naps. highly recommend!

this tool is effective, but i recommend purchasing the extra course rollers. the regular roller was not effective enough for me, though i do not have major foot issues. still, i am satisfied with my purchase.

amazing product! after struggling with one toenail for years, this was recommended by a doctor. i used it several times a day, and now the toenail is completely clear.

this product works well, but the instructions were vague. there was no guidance on how much antifreeze to add, and i noticed some leaks around the control panel. however, it does work as needed.

works perfectly and meets all expectations. no issues at all.

i am impressed with the solid construction. the oxygen port stays fixed, which avoids constant adjustments.

unfortunately, this caused a burning sensation similar to nettles. it was not suitable for me.

i used this to create "zombie flesh" for a pumpkin, and it worked wonderfully. it was my first time using liquid latex, and after watching a few youtube tutorials, i got the exact look i wanted. super easy to use and very effective.

the product works just as advertised. setting it up was a little tricky, but once i got the hang of the instructions, it was easy to install. i use it daily and find it very useful.

these scrubbers are colorful and clean well, though they are not scented. a good option for everyday use.

these tissues with lotion are gentle on a sore nose. they are much softer than regular tissues, making them perfect for sensitive skin or frequent use.

after starting this product, i have noticed small improvements in my wellbeing. its been a tough journey, but the better sleep, softer feet, and moments of happiness keep me hopeful.

these clippers are heavyduty and work great on thick or ingrown nails. the sharpness is excellent, and the handles are comfortable to use. they also come with a protective cover for the tips.

i have been using this lions mane powder for a while and love it. i prefer adding it to my coffee, and it has no noticeable taste. its part of a mushroom blend that is kept me and my husband healthy.

it looks like gravy but stays cool for a while when applied. the texture is unique and refreshing.

a great product at an excellent price. i am very pleased with my purchase.

this shower head holder is super easy to use and adjust. it fits perfectly in my shower tub combo, and i can move it to different heights, which is perfect for both kids and adults. highly recommend for anyone looking for a flexible shower solution.

this herb set was an awesome find! the quality exceeded my expectations, and there were more herbs than i anticipated. its definitely something i would consider gifting, but i am enjoying it for myself right now.

the product arrived faster than expected and was exactly what i wanted. id definitely recommend it to anyone.

these wipes clean glasses better than anything else i have tried, but they are a twopart system. first, you use the wet wipe, then the dry one. the wipes are small, so its a bit inconvenient for larger glasses, but they leave glasses spotless.

i would prefer a lower strength, around 1.752.00.

a bit pricey, but the cushion is very well made and heavyduty. its really helping with my hip discomfort, both in my truck and office chair. i am considering upgrading to a larger version.

these earplugs are fantastic! they come with storage cases, and they are super comfortable, especially for sensitive ears. unlike the expanding kind, they do not get tangled in hair or fall out overnight. perfect for my night shifts.

i am happy with the product, the price, and the speed of delivery.

it would be better as a clear product, but the bubbles it creates are a good indicator that the rez block is working well.

unfortunately, i did not see any improvement after using this for a month. it left my hair feeling greasy. also, the companys customer service was rude, which was disappointing.

the product was in perfect condition when it arrived.

my daughter had this piggy since she was born and wanted another one after 20 years. its identical to the one she had, and she was so happy to receive it.

this allinone shaver is fantastic! it works great on my legs and knees, especially with the flexible heads. it also functions as a trimmer, hair clipper, and noseear hair trimmer. the led screen and rechargeable design are great additions.

the flossing function is a bit messy, but the product works well overall.

hemp goodness!

a perfect replacement for my old one.

the scents from these bombs are amazing! i could smell them before even opening the box. they dissolve beautifully, leaving the room smelling wonderful. just be aware that the glitter can be a bit messy.

i did not enjoy the taste as much as the raw red maca from organique, but i might try the raw version from this brand. i love making maca tea!

absolutely love this product!

i have been using this in my physical therapy routine, and its been a great addition for strengthening my wrist and forearm. ill continue to use it daily, though id recommend checking with a therapist or doctor first.

while mainly petroleum jelly, i am impressed with this product. its clear, has a pleasant scent, and does not sting like other diaper rash creams. i have used it on my skin, and its soothing without feeling greasy.

i love these treats, but the price here is too high compared to cvs, where i can get them for 14.

these did not cancel much noise and were uncomfortable to sleep with, especially for side sleepers. the stems seem too long.

i appreciate this brands approach to skincare, combining supplements and topical products. this biotin blend is full of vitamins for hair, skin, and nails. its a great option for those who prefer an allinone supplement.

this product is a gamechanger for oily skin! it keeps my skin matte for hours, and the bottle is larger than i expected, so it should last a while.

ill be returning this. it did not fit my toothbrush, and now i cannot remove the head. very disappointing!

coq10 is an antioxidant that is good for heart health and blood pressure, and this formula is watersoluble, which means better absorption. while its hard to tell the exact benefits, i feel confident that its working.

this tool was recommended after my knee replacement, but i found that sliding on my pants and socks on my own helped improve muscle tone just as effectively. it could be useful for those with back issues or trouble reaching their shoes.

the cardholder section does not stay together properly, and the magnet is not strong enough to keep the cover closed. i ended up giving it away and buying a different one.

this therapy rollon smells great, and even though it did not help with my slight migraine, it did not make it worse. i am going to try it on a nonheadache day and see if it helps with mood and alertness.

there is no way to thread the electric mask, even after following the instructions. very frustrating!

a fantastic product at a reasonable price! i use these for soft scrubbing tasks around the kitchen and bathrooms. i keep one in each room and refill them with bulk baking soda. it is a great addition to any cleaning routine. pairing with a bit of vinegar makes the perfect disinfectant. plus, it is an allnatural solution. i regularly update my reviews with useful insights, and i hope you find this helpful!

highly recommend! this works brilliantly. it is quick, easy to use, and leaves feet feeling incredibly soft. i will definitely buy again.

the limeade flavor is delicious, mixing well with other flavors. however, there is an odd smell i cannot pinpointmaybe from the coconut water, sucralose, or bcaas. it is not unpleasant, just unfamiliar. id also love to know more about the bcaa quality. additionally, the presence of sucralose is not my preferred sweetener. otherwise, this would have earned five stars.

i wear compression socks daily due to long hours of sitting. at the end of the day, i have noticed my feet and ankles stay much less swollen. plus, the design gets a lot of compliments!

this product has a pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering. it worked well for removing odor from my shoes.

perfect for what its intended to do and priced right!

i was not satisfied with this product as the bristles were too short to clean my teeth effectively.

the formula changed years ago, and unfortunately, it no longer has the same effectiveness.

while this product did freshen up my garments a little, its not a replacement for professional dry cleaning. ill use it in between dry cleanings to freshen up a dress, but that is about it.

it feels like using conditioner instead of shampoo. i have not seen dramatic changes yet, but as a senior, i am not expecting miracles. the fragrance is very light, which does not bother me at all, even with my sinus issues.

before you take this, be aware that dr. oz recommended 50 mg twice a day 100 mg total on his may 21 show, "craving killers to shut down your appetite." the product here is 800 mg per capsule, which is much higher than what he advised. just sharing what i heard from dr. oz!

this product was very helpful when my husband injured his hand!

not only does it leave a nice scent, but it also disinfects and removes wrinkles. lysol, please never stop making thisits truly amazing!

it works, though not quite like how it is demonstrated in videos.

i bought this for my wife. while filling and carrying it is a bit of a hassle, once she uses it, her feet feel 100 better. the heat and massage work perfectly, just as advertised. the attached drain hose makes draining it simple.

disappointed with this product. its cheap, does not heat as well as a standard flatiron, and the "comb" attachment is useless. i have a short pixie cut, and this did not work well for me at all. i was frustrated and ended up returning it.

i love this compact water flosserits perfect for travel. i have one for home and one for when were on the go. the adjustable power settings are a nice touch, though the water reservoir is smaller than others i have used. its still a great choice for portability.

exactly what i neededbig enough for all my essential oils and more. its lightweight and easy to store.

most sunshine lamps tend to burn out, but the lights of america desk lamp lasts nearly forever. its wellbuilt, and even though verilux lamps are pricier, they offer a 3year warranty. the extra cost is worth it to avoid the cheaper, unreliable lamps.

this product is perfect for its intended use. it provides great hold and has performed well for my needs.

very nice bath brushes!

the advertisement was misleading.

this product not only removed discoloration but also tackled material that my other cleaning methods could not remove. however, i deducted one star because using alcohol to clean a product that is used in such a sensitive area is not ideal.

i bought this to store my colored sequins for crafting, and its perfect for that purpose. the compartments close securely and are spacious. it would also be great for organizing medications.

its hard to say whether this product is effective yet. the flavor is not great, but it might take longterm use to judge its full impact.

i am unsure if this is doing anything a regular washcloth would not do. it seems to make my skin flaky, which might be due to it exfoliating, but i am hopeful it improves over time.

i have used gold bond products for years, and this one is no exception. it worked wonders on my itchy summer dry skin, and the cooling spray is refreshing without leaving a sticky residue. it also helps prevent chafing when i am working in the sun.

the nail boards are excellent, and i am very pleased with them. thank you!

this product is convenient, stylish, and practical. i often use it on patients at the clinic. the price is reasonable, and it seems durable for longterm use.

this set of six bath bombs offers a wonderful fragrance, with each one containing essential oils. the scents are subtle but refreshing, and the bath bombs are large enough for a foot soak. though they are a bit on the pricey side, they make a great gift.

i frequently suffer from dry skin on my fingertips and cracked knuckles. these pads are a lifesaver, providing relief for my hands. they are very handy to have around.

these are the only foot pads i usesoft, smooth, and gentle on my skin.

i have only worn my first pair for about half an hour, and the tops have already stretched out so much that they are now above the top of my boots.

this set includes six medium, elegant gift bags. however, there was a shortage of handle ribbonsonly 10 were included instead of 12. the bags are high quality and perfect for birthdays, but the price of 1.80 per bag feels a bit steep, especially with one unusable bag.

these straws were a great match for my red and black party decorations. they were a big hit at the birthday gathering!

be cautiousthese contain magnesium and maltitol, which can cause digestive issues. after two months, i figured out that these were upsetting my system. i did lose weight, but it was not worth the digestive discomfort.

these have been great at preventing my glasses from slipping down my nose.

this essence functions as a toner and essence in one. it comes in a sturdy glass bottle, and i apply a quartersized amount, which absorbs easily without any greasiness. it leaves my skin hydrated and nourished.

i rely on this to cover and protect the skin under leuko tape. it works great and is especially useful during physical therapy sessions.

a great product that seems to help with digestion, and it may also assist with weight loss. so far, its been effective for a few days.

my girlfriend, who is very particular about skincare, noticed significant improvement after using this. her acne cleared up, and her skin feels softer and smoother. she also uses it to remove makeup, and it works easily. she would recommend this to others.

these containers are colorful, sturdy, and have a secure top. the bright color makes them easy to find.

great product, love it!

this product did not work for me. i would not recommend wasting your money on it.

the installation was easy, and it has worked flawlessly for several weeks now. no complaints at allthis product did exactly what i expected.

i like these bcaas because they are vegan and flavored with glutamine. the apple flavor is decent, and the powder dissolves well. while they are not perfect, i have had worse products. they seem to support my workouts and recovery.

this hardcover journal is a great addition for anyone in need of a durable, wellbound notebook. it features a ribbon marker to help you easily find where you left off, and the pages are ruled for neatness. however, i noticed that the date appears on the right side of the odd pages, which felt a bit inconsistent. ideally, the date should appear on the left side for both odd and even pages. additionally, automatic page numbering would have been a nice touch, considering its a sturdy book unlikely to have pages removed. nonetheless, the journal is still a reliable, highquality choice.

a simple yet effective solution, this bag has plenty of room to carry my bible and notes. it also includes multiple pockets, making it ideal for storing pens, papers, and other essentials.

i received a bottle of this supplement through the vine program, and it has been a great addition to my routine. my mom was advised by her doctor to increase her intake of vitamin d and calcium. since we do not venture out much, these small, easytoswallow capsules are a convenient way to meet those needs. they are also glutenfree, which is a bonus as she is reducing her gluten consumption. i am pleased with the price and effectiveness so far.

i purchased this scalp brush in hopes of deep cleaning my scalp, and while it works well for the hairline, it tends to tangle my hair on top of my head. it is not a dealbreaker, but i likely will not repurchase this product.

a friend recommended this tincture during my detox journey, and i am so glad i tried it. it has no aftertaste, which is a huge plus! i can tell the company puts a lot of care into their products, and i plan to explore more of their offerings in the future.

i use ciba clear care to clean my contact lenses every night, and its perfect for when i travel. it keeps my lenses clean and comfortable with ease.

after using probiotics for years to manage my mild ibs, i decided to try these chewable probiotics. the 'dark chocolate' flavor was a pleasant surpriseits delicious! it makes taking my daily probiotics a treat, and i have noticed a reduction in bloating. probiotics are great for everyone is digestive system, but if you love chocolate, this version will make your daily routine even better.

these shrink wrap bags have been fantastic for my bath bomb business! the size is just right, and the price is unbeatable. i have had no issues with tearing like i did with other brands, and the product is still visible through the wrap after a few days, which is a nice touch. as long as the price stays competitive, ill be a repeat customer.

it performs exactly as expected, delivering good results with no surprises.

i found these difficult to read. i am not sure if its just me, but based on my experience and other reviews, these may not be the best option if you have vision issues. ill be trying a different brand next time.

this product worked wonders and delivered instant results.

this moringa powder is finely ground and seems to be of high quality. i added it to my smoothie and could not taste it at all, which is great! moringa is known for its impressive health benefits, including antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal properties.

i saw a commercial for this silicone back scrubber and was excited by the lather it produced. unfortunately, it did not work the same for me. despite trying multiple techniques, i could not get the same amount of lather. while it might be a good exfoliator, i am not convinced its as effective as advertised, so i would not recommend it to friends and family.

this airway tube is an excellent addition to any first aid kit. however, its important to be trained in how to use it. its made of medicalgrade plastic, comes in a sterile bag, and has a close expiration date.

these are by far the best in the market, and i could not be more pleased with them.

a great trimmer for nose hair and smaller facial hairs. its easy to use and charge, and does the job effectively.

i bought one of these for only two dollars at walmart a while ago and have since tried several others. i came back to this brand and purchased multiple units despite the higher price here. its worth it!

the 4pack is an excellent deal, especially when considering that buying them individually would cost 25 more. the product arrived quickly and was in great condition.

pregnenolone was recommended by my doctor when i started bioidentical hormone therapy for menopause. it has noticeably improved my memory and mood. i am pleased with the results and consider it a great complement to my other hormones.

if you are not willing to pay 79.98 for a month's supply, id suggest looking elsewhere for these ingredients. while they are effective, you can find cheaper alternatives for turmeric, astaxanthin, and holy basil leaf supplements. however, the bioavailability seems good, and the product is easy to swallow.

this product is designed for use on surfaces that are already cleaned, so it does not serve as an effective cleaner on its own.

a great product overall!

the pepper extract in this product enhances the absorption of curcumin, which is beneficial for inflammation, joint support, and overall wellbeing. i have been taking it for over a year and highly recommend doing some research to understand its full benefits.

i was pleasantly surprised by the taste of these apple cider vinegar supplements. the hint of cider is there but not overpowering, and the addition of pomegranate and beet juice makes them even better for your health. both my husband and i felt lighter and more energized within days of taking them. i am definitely glad i took a chance on these and will continue using them.

unfortunately, this product did not work for me and broke soon after purchase.

initially, i liked these sleep masks, but after using them for a while, the red mask left black marks from the strap on my sheets, which would not wash out. i also had to make a small adjustment to the nosepiece to improve light blocking. despite these issues, the price is good, and they do work well after modifications.

while the flavor of this protein powder initially had an aftertaste, i eventually grew to love it. its now my favorite protein mix, and i plan to try other flavors from the same company.

these slippers are greatthey warm up faster than i expected. the only issue i have is that the zippers tend to unzip easily, but a small zip tie on each zipper solves the problem and keeps the warming sheet in place.

these are perfect for making scrubs.

this stool is very sturdy and can support my weight comfortably. however, it does slide easily on linoleum floors, which is a bit of a drawback.

these christmas cards are a perfect mix of simple and elegant, without being overly sentimental. they are just good, classic cards.

excellent quality nail files!

i tend to drink a bit more alcohol than i should, so i was looking for something to support my liver health. i decided to try this total liver formulation, and it has been great! it contains milk thistle and other liversupporting ingredients. after following the recommended dosage, i started feeling better and noticed a reduction in that sluggish liver feeling.

adjusting the pencil length with the included allen wrench can be tricky, especially for individuals with conditions like parkinson's. it could use a more userfriendly design.

this item looked cute at first but quickly turned a brownish color and stained my bathtub.

these are small, so i tend to lose them easily. make sure to use the little case they come with to keep them safe.

these worked well overall, but i stretched them too much, causing the plastic to warp. still, its a solid product.

this spray delivers a fine mist, which i really love!

moringa is packed with nutrients and is easy to add to smoothies or tea. this powder mixes well and is a great addition to my daily routine. highly recommended!

super cute and a nice size. it made for a great gift, and the recipient loved it!

these tissues are super soft, and we go through them quickly. buying in bulk is a great way to save money.

this probiotic is effective but feels a bit too expensive for what it offers.

this footrest is perfect for making shaving easier, and its nice and sturdy. i love the little section for my soap, and the holes at the bottom allow it to drain well. highly recommended!

i have purchased this product several times and continue to be satisfied with it.

while some supplements on amazon come from questionable sources, this one is made with care and seems effective. it contains a good mix of probiotic strains and has worked well for general digestive support.

these blue glass bottles are solid and durable, making them great for essential oils. the only drawback is that they do not have metal rollers, but they are still a good option for onthego aromatherapy.

this chlorella supplement is easy to take and offers great health benefits. its tasteless and does not because any aftertaste. it would be nice if it was organic, but overall, i am happy with the product.

a liquid needs to be placed in a squeeze bottle or an eyedropper must be used to apply this product effectively.

i initially thought allegra was working for my allergies, but i am still struggling. after trying nasacort as a last resort, it is still not providing relief. quite frustrating!

i bought these for my daughter who works in a secure environment where she needs to wear badges and now a mask. she loves the colors and says the clip is excellent for keeping her mask perfectly adjusted.

the first thing i appreciate about this brush is its sleek design and color. however, it is lightweight, like a regular toothbrush, and the bristle head is smaller, which may be more suited for children. if you prefer a heavier, more standard brush, this may not be for you. but it is a great deal because it comes with two boxes and extra brush heads. the original price seems high, but with the extras, its a good value.

i am impressed with this product. it is easy to use, dissolves well, and stays in suspension as advertised. it exceeded my expectations!

this trimmer works okay for the price, but calling it "professional" is a stretch. it is designed more for casual use, like trimming beards or sideburns, with a unique steampunkinspired look. while it has interchangeable blades and a usb charging port, the exposed mechanism and lack of ergonomic design make it unsuitable for prolonged use. its battery life is decent but might require frequent charging for professional use. still, it is a fun gift for a hipster.

these glasses have great style and seem durable, but i had to return them because i could not see clearly through the upper portionthere was noticeable distortion. i hope this is not an issue for others!

i was hesitant at first, but after dealing with neck pain for months, i decided to try this. while other devices helped a little, this neck brace did not work for me. the heat zone is too small, and the brace is a bit uncomfortable. it might work for others, but not for me. my boyfriend also did not like it, as it only heated a small patch of the neck.

not impressed with this product.

if you only need a slight expansion around a quarter inch, these might work fine. however, for anything more, they just stretch and lose effectiveness.

i am a 60yearold woman who is been battling oily skin, acne, and large pores for years. this product has truly transformed my skinafter six weeks, it is clear, smooth, and radiant. i no longer feel embarrassed to go without makeup! it tingled and burned initially, but it is worth it, as the pimples heal faster and my pores are no longer an issue.

the silicone sponge did not blend my liquid foundation well. it just sat on top of my skin rather than blending in like a brush. it was not a huge expense, so not too bad overall, but i will not be using it again.

it worked well, but make sure to avoid the eyes as instructed.

after years of neck pain and relying on ibuprofen, i discovered epsom it. it works quickly to relieve pain and lasts for a while, with no strong odor or greasy residue.

the nozzle does not stay on properly.

the product smells great! ill continue using it to see how long the effects last.

this set contains six large, individually wrapped bath bombs shaped like pastries. each one is fragrant, but the scents are quite similar. the bomb with the rainbow top was fun to use, and it dissolved well, creating bright pink water without staining. at 2.29 per bomb, its a nice and affordable gift option.

the adhesive is strong enough to stay in place but gentle enough for easy removal.

this product works, but it requires significant effortlots of elbow greaseeven after it has softened the sealer.

my husband swears by this product combined with vitamin b complexit seems to work like the iv treatments you get for alcohol withdrawal. it is a little amusing but effective!

these insoles have been a gamechanger for my son who has sever's disease. they have significantly eased his heel pain. we now have a pair in his regular sneakers and another in his tennis shoes, making a huge difference. highly recommend them for any child experiencing similar pain.

i love it! it works great, but the batteries need to be replaced every two weeks.

these are too short and flimsy, offering no real control. i might use them for different purposes, but not for their intended use.

a wellknown probiotic for ibd and other gastrointestinal issues. its a solid choice, especially since it does not require refrigeration. the low price makes it a good option for those looking to start improving gut health.

this face mask chain is perfect. as a high school teacher, its both functional and stylish. the pink color matches my signature style, and the chain keeps my mask clean and handy when i need to take it off for a while. its the right weight, not too heavy or uncomfortable.

i bought this tourniquet for hiking with my dogs. its light, easy to use, and a practical item to carry in case of emergencies. its just like the other tourniquets i have purchased, and i am happy with it.

it works great on my mat! i love the relaxing lavender scent. i put it in a spray bottle, and it cleans and smells wonderful. the fragrance lasted even a week later. ill continue using this!

these plastic storage cases are great for keeping items dry and dustfree, like masks and tissues. they are sturdy, easy to locate thanks to their bright colors, and have small plastic edges inside to secure the contents.

poorly constructed, and it did not stay on my elbow. i would not recommend it.

this product works fine.

i wanted to replace my nylon pouf with something more durable. while this is easy to use, its very soft and offers no exfoliation. its more for someone with sensitive skin. i do like that it has a side for massaging the scalp, but it would be better with a hanging loop.

the kit is decent, but the bristles on my brush are already bent.

this dryer is fantastic for someone like me who struggles with coordination. the three heat modes cool, warm, hot make it versatile, and it helps style and dry hair in one step. its perfect for achieving a smooth look with customizable volume.

id love to rate this higher, but unfortunately, this powder messed with my digestive system, even at half the recommended dose. the flavor is sweet but not unpleasant. it mixes well in a blender bottle, though it takes a bit longer to blend. i felt more hydrated but did not get the energy boost i expected, even after heavy exercise.

these bags are similar to ziplocs in terms of quality and durability, which is a good thing. the packers logo adds a fun touch, and while the branding costs a bit more, it makes these bags stand out.

the items arrived melted.

these are essential for changing bandages before showering. they are sterile, easy to use, and provide the right level of protection.

this mask is fantastic, but i received black masks instead of the white ones i ordered. it was a little disappointing, but i am not returning them.

the handle and back of the bristles get hot enough to burn. qmaxx made a better version, with heatresistant material and a safer design.

i really love the quality of this product. its wellmade, looks good, and i will definitely buy it again.

i gave this to a friend with thinner thighs and calves, and it works well for him. however, its not ideal for larger individuals, as the sides press uncomfortably against calves, making it difficult to use for those with more bulk.

best drink ever!

this is my second purchase of the tropical saccharomyces boulardii yeast probiotic. it has noticeably reduced my night reflux episodes. since i started taking it, i have not experienced a single flareup.

i absolutely love this product. i use it almost daily, and the comfort and warmth it provides are unmatched. the quality is exceptional, and the price is significantly lower than the smaller packages i have bought before. you will not regret it!

this placard holder is wellmade and sturdy. however, the new north carolina placards do not fit perfectly, as the top extends above the hook. it still works but can be a bit difficult to hang.

the taste of this creatine is terrible, but it provides great results!

i have purchased oak  navy bibs three times, and i love them! they are cute, functional, and wellloved by others. the little cowl neck is great for catching drool and food. they are highquality and a musthave for any fashionable little one.

would not buy again. its too small and difficult to use.

i spent a little more on this item because the product photo looked better than others on amazon. however, when i opened it, it looked dirty, almost like it had been used before. i was disappointed. the seller kindly sent a replacement, which was clean and helpful, so i am increasing the rating to four stars.

this wedge is fantastic. its durable, easy to clean, and higher than most, which is exactly what i needed for better circulation during sleep.

the idea is great, but the adhesion is poor. i had to use glue to make it stay on the shoes.
