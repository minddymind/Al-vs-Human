this set contains two travelsized pill cases with a slim profile each featuring six compartments and 54 labels each compartment is equipped with a secure clasp that ensures a tight seal as shown in the image i could fit up to 20 of my 50mcg d3 tablets in a single compartment the compact and portable design stands out as the key highlight keep in mind larger pills particularly ones that are more substantial may not fit in the compartments the lids do not stay fully open while inserting or removing pills so they will remain partially open its also worth noting that the pill case should be inserted with the side featuring the finger nubs facing upwards for correct placement at 899 its a great deal coming out to just 4 per case
solidly built however i do wish the handle was slightly longer
