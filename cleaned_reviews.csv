So sad I return it coz I’m not comfortable to ride I’m heavy.Bad experience when I returned charged me $400. A have to shoulder this money for three months so I can pay Amazon. I’m scared to buy now.......,human
"Can’t use , much too large, my fault , didn’t know  20mm would be so large",human
"I experienced vision loss and needed to cover up one of my eyes for the muscles to rest. I was so tired of wearing a different eyepatch that was very rough and uncomfortable on my eye.When I got these, it was a noticeable difference in comfort. These feel like silk on your eye. Even though my eye was protruding a little bit due to swelling, they fit comfortably over it and allowed me to function. I also liked that the strap around your head was not super tight. I would definitely recommend these over the harder plastic ones!",human
"Was hoping this would help with the pain in the ball of my foot, but it ended up hurting me more from the elastic around the pad. The pain from this overrode the pain in my foot and caused more pain for me. Very uncomfortable and will need to find something else. What a waste of money!",human
"I would like to order a corn bag with more ""pockets"".  This is  a little shorter than I expected.  I may contact seller to ask for a longer one.  These are very easy to warm in microwave and comfortable to use.",human
Always liked this brush,human
Wonderful Pink Floyd hat. My husband loves it! Perfect fit. Thank you.,human
Great!!,human
Best glass cleaner ever!,human
My naturopath recommended this for me. I put it in my morning smoothies and don’t taste it at all.,human
The brush heads don’t last for long. Get a new brush with the attachments or get the brush heads made by aquasonic.,human
This sleeve fits comfortably and provides plenty of support and compression to relieve my knee pain.  I've tried others that were not nearly as comfortable.,human
"I like the longer length, and I like the snap closure.  I would have prefered the old fashioned ties, but I do not like velcro, so I take whatever I can get.  lol The bibs are not absorbent much at all.  They do protect my clothing!",human
I really enjoy DripDrop when needed.  I can't locate this product in my area so I order from Drip Drop through Amazon.  It's purpose is to hydrate and  I think it works well.,human
"I just love these, I had water dripping down my arms and now this is no longer a problem. Washing my face ,hair ,and hands doesn't require a change of clothes. I gave one to a girlfriend and she just raves about them.",human
"We were given a jar of this, I didn't even think to check Amazon that it would be listed here. None the less, this works for us...for all that is mentioned on the jar. In the future we will order from Amazon, as it's cheaper on this site over ordering from the Amish orgin site, even the shipping is less too.We both have knee joint pain, this works to relive the discomfort from arthritis. Most all of the other aches and pains we come to have with age. We have also used this for colds and sore throats too.",human
"I added additional items to it , but they are so perfect & sturdy! Super light weight which I love !",human
"I read some great reviews about this product before I purchased it. Honestly, it's the only reason I was comfortable trying the product. I was excited to try it. I've been searching for a solution for my snoring. I've had several nasal surgeries and it has gotten pretty bad I must admit.First, it didn't fit in my nose, maybe my nostrils are too close together? I'm not sure. But when I did get it to fit, it was extremely uncomfortable.Full disclosure, I did not wear it to bed so I'm unsure if it would affect snoring or not. Sorry.",human
They made my stomach very upset & the pills were very dusty and chalky.,human
"I really liked this product because you can use it on ANY jewelry ( although I haven’t tried marcasite because of the liquid properties) so I bought it again. It is not chemical I believe and does not harm pearls or costume jewelry ( fashion) yet you can do gold and diamonds.  I clean quite a bit of jewelry. I still recommend a silver polishing cloth( jewelry polishing cloth) for most silver to keep the natural beauty of the oxidation, or “ tarnish” that is sometimes intentionally put there. This is very gentle on silver though, unlike the dips and cleaners that strip away the beauty of the silver.",human
The flavor and crunchiness is perfect! The price is also excellent for these. I will definitely order again.  I have not found anything at the store that compares.,human
"It was just too complex for me to figure out how to do. But, just because I couldn't figure it out, doesn't mean you won't. I give it a rating of 2 stars",human
"Junk. Didn't even last a year before it just randomly stopped workingwon't charge. Too bad, I actually liked it until this.",human
outstanding product if you have bp issues this will help you,human
I've already written reviews before on this product.  Stop asking for reviews.  If I order it more than once it must at the very least be OK.,human
Great Item,human
"I very rarely wore sneakers or athletic shoes prior to the pandemic as no matter what brand I bought (Dr. Scholl’s; Etnies; Reebok; Skechers) they hurt my feet. I even tried gel inserts – nothing would help.I often, and with great success, wore flip flops. I wore them at theme parks, at a racetrack, running errands.But, I still craved the security of a sneaker.I decided to get these, and thought they’d work.The BIGGEST issue – no guidelines to cut the insert. And, for what they’re charging paying customers (I got a complimentary review product) – that is really unacceptable. Even the cheap Dr. Scholl’s have guidelines.As far as comfort? These inserts were a tad too stiff and rough. With my feet already having issues – I didn’t want to wait a good two weeks to see how well they worked. Then again, due to the pandemic – that two weeks might be months as I don’t go out. I mostly due curbside, drive-thru, or delivery for what I need.Given the mixed reviews – I don’t think I’d get these again and I would caution against anyone I personally know, purchasing them.",human
Absolutely didn’t help or feel comfortable at all.,human
Over the course of a year I’ve purchased three different insoles with the main reason searching for  great arch support. These insoles are by far the best I’ve found for that reason. As a result of a back injury I developed a drop foot and have a fallen arch in my right foot. These insoles help with that problem better than any I’ve purchased yet. I will be buying more of these insoles now that I’ve found that they are the best for my situation.,human
"It works, but it leaves a film",human
"These are lightweight, comfortable and flexible.The perfect reading glasses.I am disappointed that they are difficult to find.",human
This product was very beneficial to me providing energy boost and decrease in physical pain I was experiencing. Great taste and convenient packaging.,human
Always leaves spots no matter how much I use.  I don’t like it but have to use the rest of it.  Won’t purchase again,human
Great idea! Would’ve given five stars if you could adjust size for the kids but keeps up w our goofy face masks!,human
I use these for my prenatal vitamins. I can tell such a huge difference with out them.,human
Smells great. Taste good. Works really well!,human
"Product is above average but all kits should include a ""includes checklist"".  Meaning that there's an inventory of things and an easy way to check off what has been used.",human
"It's very cushioning; however, it's very slippery, it made my heels slip out with every step I take.",human
"Love the size and convenience, don’t love that it shuts off randomly even when battery is charged",human
"These are really good probiotics. My GF has problems with acid-reflux and I suggested this to her. She felt improvement the first day! She had tried one other of my probiotics which I've reviewed (discounted purchase) and didn't like the other brand (made her feel constipated) but she is a convert to the Power Pearls. She forgot to take them for 2 days and her reflux symptoms returned.Best of the 3 we've tried, and easy to swallow.",human
Not worth the money they are like cardboard,human
Best dishwasher detergent on the market !,human
Awesome..blocks out all sounds and so comfortable..I don't even feel them in my ears.,human
"These bags rip open easily, either when trying to open them to put them in the compost can or when taking them back out, full of stuff. We use them in a 1 gallon can so they’re not overfull.",human
"The electric brush works surprisingly well.  And it does not burn hair or scalp.  The minor design flaw is that when using, it is easy to accidentally click on the optional mister.  But typically, a bit of mist is appreciated...",human
It works,human
"Great for a quick stretch. . Exactly what I was looking for. Only thing I could say that is in the neighborhood of bad is that I had to go out and buy eye hole screws.  Not a biggie, in no way was a surprise and in no way affects the product or its listing.",human
"Tasty, refreshing, fun, no stevia aftertaste.I am really enjoying the orange flavor; it reminds me of Tang. Just bought Blue Raspberry to try, too.I eat keto and find these drinks useful. Am using the mixed drink to make popsicles, granitaand gelatin squares, too.",human
It works!,human
transaction and product were perfect,human
If you're trying to turn your sink into a Jackson Pollock painting it's great; not so much for teeth.,human
Warning it's a chemical to be used by professionals,human
I got it for my mother in law and my self. We loved it because it's long and our sleeves don't get wet and it's comfortable.,human
Ginseng has delivered several beneficial results. Morning sickness? Pickled ginseng from the grocery refrigerated section and supplements keep it at bay. Monotonous low energy? Ginseng.Ginsenosides are a natural steroid group exclusive to the Panax genus of ginseng. It acts as an anti-inflammatory. 2-3% concentrations are natural in Panax. 10% would be a 3x concentration.Always reliable. Nice value. Seems like a quality source.,human
The idea of being able to hang the readers on my neck without a chain caught my attention and this feature works really well. I also love that these readers are blue light blocking. Great value for quality!,human
These are great.  We use them in a ceiling fan.  They are standard base and are dimmable.,human
"I like this memory book.  It's got all the pages I'd hoped for and it's really cute.  The only drawback is that it begins to look full and bulging when items are added.  For instance, I've added ticket stubs, photos, etc. and it's now big.  My daughter is only four months old, and it's already looking overfilled.  I actually don't mind much, but if you're wanting a pristine-looking baby book AND want to add items and mementos, you're probably better off doing an actual scrapbook.",human
"I thought these bands were elastic. It is difficult to put it on alone as sometimes the metal part hits the mask where the earloop starts and may snap off the earloop. Once on, they do increase the sealing of the kn95 mask.",human
This stuff lasts forever!! Best part is you can refill the bottles too!!,human
"Collagen is a fantastic supplement for so many reasons! It's great for your hair, skin, nails, gut, immune system, and more! This powder is super easy to incorporate into your diet. My favorite way to take it is to blend it into my morning protein smoothie. It virtually disappears and you'd have no idea it was even there. You can also add it to both hot and cold drinks, sprinkle it on your yogurt, add it to soup, bake with it, etc... It's super easy to sneak into almost anything. This powder is nice and fine and seems to be nice quality. This is a little more expensive than other varieties I've seen though. Usually you can get a 1lb tub of collagen powder for about the same price as this and this is only 10 ounces, so it's not the best deal, but it does seem to be good quality.",human
"Good product, but the color of pills is different from the last bottle I got. Not sure why",human
Perfect little shovels as they are called in our house! Thank you for a good product,human
Best non greasy sun protection spray. Easy to apply and effective. Though expensive.,human
"These did not pop no matter what the kids tried.  They do have the strongest suction cups ever, so the kids had great fun sticking it to their faces and bodies.",human
"From performance to quality to color, I like them.Thank you.",human
It works in combination with other herbs I have managed to get hold of in my own country so very pleased.,human
It sucks that this doesn't suck enough to be effective. I'm so disappointed. And itchy.,human
I love it and have used it all over house and in car. Battery doesn't last as long as stated but several uses for sure. Great item,human
"This ice bag is both functional & cute.  I got one for myself, plus one for a girlfriend, who loved it!  The size is a little smaller than I expected, judging from the picture. But for a runner it's the perfect size to fit on a sore knee.",human
I HATE WASTING MONEY ON SUPPLEMENTS WONDERING IF THEY ARE DOING ANYTHING AT ALL.  WITH 17HD YOU CAN FEEL IT WORKING IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.  IT IS AMAZING.  MY WORKOUTS ARE TRULY INTENSE AND IT IS HARD TO LEAVE THE GYM - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!,human
This wig has nappy roots. Its really poofy and the hair quality is very poor. It looked nothing like the picture. I would hope that my wig was just a defect and you receive a product that you're satisfied with. Not happy:(,human
I use it on my neck where I have some bone deterioration.  Wow it really feels good  and the relief from the discomfort in my neck lasts for at least a day and sometimes longer.  🥰,human
"Got the right stuff, on time in a right package.",human
"This is a great product if you do not have pets, or lint in your home. Not good for people with pets or lots of hairs laying around. It is a magnet that is hard to keep clean and fresh looking. Otherwise extremely comfortable and functional.",human
This is a product I've used for the last 8years. It's a very good product and was delivered right on time. Please continue this product. I would like to see the packages come in 96 ct and kind of case price for the amount of clothes in the future.Thank youShelly R.,human
"Aside from making you run to the bathroom all the time and your insides hurt, you gain weight instead of losing it.",human
These were ok. Served the purpose okay but not great.,human
"Product is super close to expiration date, not acceptable specially for a product that is for babies! Additionally seller did not even bother to answer my message! Don't buy anything from this seller!",human
Purchased for my two nephews! They are delighted with the fizzies at bath time.,human
Makes Mom feel special in the nursing home,human
Bought it for the girlfriend and she absolutely loved it. This is the bag we use when we go to bingo. We have had so many compliments.,human
"2nd unit we purchased. We run it 724 365 days. We change filter more often than they recommend. Complete filter kits are around $75 plus shipping of $15. Excellent filtration, very quiet. New unit has additional features.",human
Have been to Hatch... they live peppers...Hatch peppers are more than a notch above...,human
"This is my 2nd Talley &amp; Twine watch. Great watch, I would give it 6 stars if it included the date. I work in a classified office and my cell phone can  not enter, I sometimes forget the date (getting old).  Great watch for the price. I added what I would call a classier leather band. The band that came with the watch was too long for me.",human
"Perfect I put one in my book bag, purse, car, etc ehrn. Need it it's there",human
Awesome for cleaning my sewing machine!,human
Great Scale,human
This product was exactly as described and performed perfectly in cleaning coins. Easy and safe to use and without a doubt the best I have seen in a long time. Will certainly buy again.,human
But it only have USB charging which is a downfall,human
The back brace works great if you need to do work around the house. It definitely gives you full support for your back. I like how you can adjust the shoulders to fit you properly and around the belly also. I wear mine over a light t-shirt and then put another shirt on top of it when going out of the house. Around the house I just put it on over my clothes and it works great either way.,human
This was perfect . Keeping it for all future eids,human
"Do not saw significant effect after whole bottle.For this price,do not recommend.",human
Very happy with this purchase. Dealer condition of item just as described. Hope to do business again.,human
I liked that they're transparent so I can see just how much water is in them. They don't leak and retain heat pretty well. Would buy again but they seem well made and I don't expect to have to.,human
it has thumb prints allover with strands of hair.,human
only 90 minutes run time...needed hours,human
Im glad I found this frames for my 3 year old son. It is cheaper from the optalmologist store!,human
"I purchased these glasses because I liked the style and the price seemed reasonable, and because it has become increasingly difficult to find non-prescription reader bifocals in stores like Walmart. My major beef with these glasses is that they regularly need to be tightened up--the little nuts holding them together keep loosening up, and I have to use a pair of needle-nosed pliers on them almost every day.",human
"the chain broke within the first 2 hours of wearing it :( :( the locket itself is cute and seems to be made well, its a shame",human
Wasn't as much in the bag for the price paid.,human
product wasn't 100 percent what I expected but sufficient,human
Not so rough. I want coarse,human
I am a teacher and bought these for my kid’s teachers after I received one of my own. I LOVE THIS! I use it more than I thought I would and it’s so nice to have all these emergency items on hand because there is no downtime in the classroom! Love it!,human
Seemed to really help my adrenal fatigue,human
Little pricey but t the worst thing is that it burned out in two weeks . I used it in my bandsaw .,human
Love it! The scent is perfect and the product truly performs better than expected.,human
"got it yesterday, I am so delighted with this product. I have kind of fine hair. After my hair was washed and dried. Within minutes as a first time user, My hair looked professionally done. Totally excellent, certainly worth the money. I am usually not handy with my kinky curly hair. And I dread washing as I will have to fix it again. (to look presentable) I would give this a 10 star if I could",human
Perfect size. Leaves residue on hands after handling.,human
The inserts don’t cover the entire sole of the shoe so the middle of my feet feel like they’re on hard jelly with nothing padding the rest of my foot.,human
These worked very well for my nighttime comfort.  They don't fall out like my previous pair and they are easy to put in and take out.,human
"The hair was ok, a bit larger than I needed. Puff sizes would've been great.",human
"Have only been taking it for a few days, so no real results as yet, but am willing to give more after a few weeks.  My only complaint is that there is only an half a bottle of pills in these larger bottles.. why?  I combined the two bottles into one, but such a waste of packaging really pisses me off.. there's just no reason for that.",human
"These stickers smell, for a few moments.  Alas, with the end of the ""matte"" scratch and sniff sticker, the era of a long-lasting smelling sticker has ended.  These stickers do contain a scent but the scents, so ethereal, last but a few fleeting moments, and not unlike the thunder (once you comment about it, it has already ended) these stickers lose their scents quickly.Shipping was a little high, as well.:",human
I have no idea how to use this. There’s no power button on the curler or any indicator on where to turn it on. The box it came in was a little smashed but the rest of the things are okay.,human
This glasses are for women only and they are pretty small.,human
This body wash smells wonderful. The foam makes it feel luxurious too.,human
"The Corner Smart Bath Basket is wonderful.  I found it extremely easy to install, and there is no sticky residue to deal with.When I first tried to install it, I couldn't get it to stay put, so I resorted to reading the directions.  You MUST clean your shower with soap (I used Palmolive Dishwashing Liquid), then rinsed and dried the area.  After that, there was absolutely no problem.  The basket has been in place with shampoo on it for 5 weeks now without any problems.  I would recommend this product to anyone.",human
Like this scent slot.,human
Cute and well made.,human
Love it!,human
Don’t fall for the false advertising,human
"Good product, add it to my yogurt..",human
"Great gag gift, sure to upset all the other siblings.",human
This does the job!,human
"I have seen these at people’s houses and got mixed reviews. Not this brand just this product and I have seen them all over the Internet for sale. WouldHave killed for one of these in my teenage years but I will be honest, I didn’t expect itTo really work. I mean the concept seemed sound but what I thought to be common sense would tell you if it could pull a blackhead from under your skin it would pull to hard to not damageYour skin. Well common sense somehow got put to the side on this one bc I will tell you and everyone Including my mom if she asked this thing is fully legit. Luckily my skin these days isn’t just screaming with issues but for the first time in my life I was over the moon when i saw I had a blackhead. I pulled this sucker out and centered it over the spot and turned it on. I prob should have stayed on low but I clicked on the highest and I didn’t think it did anything significant. Felt the tug on my skin but clicked it right back off and looked at the little pad and saw this stuff in there and looked at my face. There was a ring that went away after like a minute and that sucker was all the way gone. It was amazing. I will vouch for this thing all day. Never bought anything that worked this good so fast. Amazing",human
Cheap quality. Plastic “toy.” Not worth it. I’ve been using it exactly as directed twice a day since I purchased it and have seen zero results.I don’t recommend it.,human
"These are likely expired? Product description states: ""Per GMP guidelines set forth by the FDA, most products are formulated for 24 months from the date of manufacture. Liquids and probiotics are formulated for 12 months.""What I received has a manufactured date of September 2016. Today is November 14th, 2018. These were ordered directly from Swanson.",human
My son liked it and it helps safety habits while promoting first aid. Enough room to add more stuff.,human
it’s narrower than expected. served my purpose well though.,human
Didn't notice any significant changes in my appetite.,human
"Misleading! Natural Armor essential oils do not have organic certification. Simply saying they are organic does not make it so. The company response to my query was, ""if you don’t feel comfortable with our company or our products, simply do not purchase them."" Buyer beware, if you truly want organic.",human
"I carry one in my backpack, and clean between my teeth after meals. It is so much gentler than using a toothpick and even gentler than using dental floss. I love the taste of the product--it refreshes your mouth after a meal. The fact that they help maintain tooth whitening is a huge bonus as well, especially because of how the brush gently squeezes between your teeth.",human
"I have really been enjoying these. Mine came very moist - Maybe even too moist in one of the tubes, and the toothpicks were very weak at first. After you open a tube the first time, they stay moist but dry enough to harden a bit, though they still won't be the most durable.The green flavor is a very different sweet spearmint, but I ended up really growing fond of it. Nice for when you don't want a full on energy drink but need a little pick me up.",human
"This stone has a fair clarity(not great), but an amazing energy.  This is one of the most energetic and uplifting stones I have encountered.  If you are a crystalworker, I recommend this wholeheartedly.This stone also pairs wonderfully with angelite.",human
Convenient and easy to use,human
These toothpicks are the shape and size I wanted and they are sturdy.,human
Really good shakey heads work well,human
"These insoles are comfortable but too narrow for my shoe which is size 13 D. The width of the insole is 3.5"" at the widest part. That leaves a total gap of about half an inch between the insole and the sides of the shoe.",human
It helps my knees,human
"They do the trick, don’t get me wrong. However, I notice some differences in these compared to the original one that came with the pari nebulizer. First, they are misshapen and kind of flat. I figured over time and use, they would get their round shape back but they haven’t. Also, my daughter started to develop a little rash on both sides of her face just outside of her mouth, exactly where the plastic touches.  That never happened with months of use with the original.",human
"Three Stars for giving a replacement and wearing fairly comfortable, but I like my new Dockers better!Rarely have I any difficulty with sellers that go through Amazon, I guess it does happen. This time I received defectiivedamaged items. JiMarti guarantees a no questions asked, prompt replacement. Unfortunately, this was NOT the case. Trying to repeatedly send emails with delayed response. Finally, I got the replacement. Quite honestly, these Sunglasses ""are nothing to write home to mamma about."" as the saying goes. All in all, I am fairly satisfied and they wear comfortably numb. I wish they would have provided a self return paid label, gladly return the first ones. Even though they DO have a nice selection, I would not rely on this seller for sunglasses again. No Questions Asked Defective Item Policy hmm... Oh yeah we get lemons @x. funky merchant emails to boot ~~~~~~ maybe we all are having a blonde hair day LOL.P.S. I wound up buying Dockers Sunglasses at a little higher price with another merchant with prompt delivery, I am happy. :)",human
"Works well. But way too expensive. These are not expensive ingredients (ginkgo, PEA HCl, and caffeine). Was willing to pay $1 per pill, even though that’s still a lot for these ingredients. At over $2 per pill??  No thanks.",human
"Arrived with 2 of the prongs already having fallen out. The ones that remained in the device scratched my skin, they were not sanded properly and were not smooth. Don’t buy this item, buy higher quality.",human
"The brush heads are too soft. It is not meant for adults but for little kidstoddlers.Not worth the money, so i returned mine.",human
Very legit,human
I'm allergic to NSAIDS so I used this product for its Anti-Flamitory and wound care after my dog bit me and it worked great!  It also smells good which in my book is a plus.  There are so many essential oils out there that smell bad and that actually give me migraines because they smell so bad.  But this one doesn't do that so it's nice to come across ones that actually smell good.  I looked it up and discovered that Rosewood does other great things like helps with depression and boosts the immune system.  It can help the skin if you have sensitive or dry or oily skin.  It can also help as a nasal decongestant.  It works as a insect repellent which is great cause I don't like bugs!!! And it can be used as a perfume.  So its another essiential oil that has multiple purposes.  I highly recommend this product!,human
"Purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder.  It IS less messy than regular powder, however, it doesn't work as well.  And it is oddly... greasy?  He reports that it is lotiony in a weird way.  Since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry.  If it's lotiony or greasy, not so much.If you're hoping for a replacement for powder - this isn't it - at least in my husband's opinion.",human

"As soon as I attempted to insert a lock cylinder into the top hole and tighten down with the thumbscrews, the unusual alignment of the thumbscrews(weren't pointed directly at the side of the cylinder) kept causing the lock to twist and the thumbscrews kept slipping off the bottom of the lock. The plastic ring that reduces the hole size then cracked. I didn't even tighten the screws that tight. I ended up using a piece of leather as a shim to hold the lock cylinder in place. This is a kwickset lock cylinder and is the most common size. Too much work to set a cylinder.",human
"I ve tried other brands, this one does good brushing and clean my teeth. One tablet is a little too spare, two are perfect. Wish the peppermint is stronger though. Easy to use, and appreciated its friendly packaging.",human
Didn't seem to do anything for me.,human
Good enough for kids to play!!,human
This product supports my digestion very well.,human
"Update at bottom.......I like that it heats up fast, the size covers my entire back and heeling properties from the hot stones. It's much better than any regular heating pad. The plug could be in a better position other than that I love it. UPDATED 21222 Loved it until I plugged it in yesterday morning and it didn't heat up and it worked fine the day before. I broke my neck and back I use a heating pad most mornings to loosen my muscles and joints so I can move. It didn't get used everyday mainly since it got cold. Only had it for almost 8 months disappointed I have to spend more money on another heating pad and most likely won't get my money back for this. NOT HAPPY",human

"Great bulk price.  Can't seem to find this scent in stores anymore, so Amazon is my go to.  Arrived as described.",human
"No idea what floral and zesty is supposed to smell like, the scent is strong but pleasant and it fills my bathroom and bedroom well. And it's not terrible and way better than cat box smell. Just wish it said what I'm supposed to be smelling because my nose is confused.",human

Delicious and healthy,human
We bought this ladder 15 years ago and it is the best investment i have ever made. Light and easy to move and can be stored anywhere. Simply the best step ladder on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!,human
"I really like this pillbox.  It's large enough to fit many pills in each slot.  It stays closed.  Clock didn't work at first, however a coke got spilled on it and suddenly the clock started working.  Ha ha.... The pills remained dry.  I definitely would buy this again.",human
This was the first product that I purchased from this brand and I always have it in my house. Melatonin is not my jam but this supplement totally is. Not only does it taste like graham crackers and childhood Christmas but it actually works. My joints definitely let me know how unhappy they are in the morning if I didn’t have this the night before. I don’t go to sleep without it. Buy it!,human
To curl my lashes,human
Promptly sent and received.  It was exactly as described.,human
"This smells wonderful, but the scent does not last.  the wax only lasted for the day and the laundry detergent smelled great but didn't last.  You can tell this is a knockoff of the original.  I'm not bashing it, but you get what you pay for :)",human
"as far as removing old steps - this thing sucks..  unless you are only going to use this on NEW steps, get something else..  the opening in the socket is too small. any older steps with rust, and bends on them, will constantly get jammed inside this bit. unless you want a future filled with hammering steps out of this socket, move on.  i suggest trying the pole step driver from Reliable instead. and i am a huge, HUGE - Milwaukee fan..  this driver bit needs a redesign.  Sorry Milwaukee, but its the truth.As far as this new lime green model goes, we stumbled onto one of our newer guys called Go-Go mounting it into a hammer drill instead of the impact.  He swears the in and out motion works a lot better than just spinning in the seated position.",human

Nice and stretchy. Good amount of adhesive.,human
"This is my second time buying irish sea moss. The first go round was a definite bust not even knowing about it, it had a terrible chemical smell, it was moist and rubbery, plus the color was very pale. THIS IRISH MOSS HOWEVER; upon opening a very pleasant smell, the bag is stuffed, and it's not covered in unnatural salt. I soaked a pinch of  it for only 10 minutes and it expanded so big I had to add more water. Haven't blended it yet but I'm confident that it will hell perfectly. I recommend this. Thank you.",human
Sucked. Quality heat.  All of it,human

"I've been using Bonapel for 3 months and am very happy with results. My tummy looks firmer and those baggy arms looking toned. I love the dimples on my face, however, the ones on my butt..had to go.

"these are U.S. 8-10 ..  they work the same, but they are not as soft as the originals + it keeps them from bunching up in heels, - they aren't as comfortable, they feel like a recycled plastic cloth product.. I'm thinking of putting thin liner socks over them .. but it's great having a thin option again!! .. even if I had to order it from the UK .. they arrived quickly though so don't worry about the long date they give. I got mine within a week",human

"The scrubber is great quality and easy to use. I am a rather small flexible human who doesn't have any issues situating the scrubber in order to scrub my back, however I'm sure those with low flexibility or a large backshoulders could still have some issues. The scrubber did come out of the package with a very strong perfume smell, thats rather nauseating, however it does fade considerably over a few washes.",human
"Wow, I love this reading glasses. It's the best reading glasses I've ever bought. It fits perfect like I was measured, light weight and I don't even feel it in my face. It also holds up in place when moving my head. I'm going to buy more other colors too.",human
Not as pliable as I expected,human
Nice but love the lemon scent better,human
Dislike the fact that first time using the handle broke off,human

"I started taking Flora-Q after my GI doctor recommended it two years ago.  I had a history of diverticulitis attacks and IBS which I am now basically free of.  I don't know how much Flora-Q has contributed to my health but I wouldn't give it up (despite the cost, which is rather high).",human

"Not good for shorter hair. Curling iron says to hold the heating mechanism away from face but then it doesn't curl your hair at all, and when you hold the heat towards your face it works better, but still doesn't make a full curl.

Love it!,human
Great product but if you shop around you can get comparable products for less money.,human
"OMG!! This thing is amazing and I love it,works great !!!🙂🙂😍😍",human
"I was very impressed with this product as I have never used anything Like this before. The balls were comfortable, packaged discreetly and very easy to clean. I think its best with you start with the smallest and work your way up to the biggest one. I liked how comfortable they were as well. Totally Recommended!",human
I have bought these before.  They fit just like the other ones did.  They stay on tight and does not loose up.  Great product and great service.,human
"Stopped working JUST after the return window expired. Very disappointed!EDIT: Seller contacted me after original review was left and offered a replacement or refund. I opted for a replacement item, and I’m glad I did- I’ve had the replacement for several months and it’s working very well. Thank you! Great customer service from the seller!!!",human
Great bags and good size. Bought them for a craft market,human
Too short and the scrubbers on the side don't hold soap.  Needs to be at least a foot longer to make it easier to use.  Not worth the money back brush works easier.  Don't waste your money on these.,human
Came fast and works fine with my facial cleaner I bought from Walmart,human
"Gorgeous scent, Lasts through the day.",human
Great pump! So easy to use and has very strong suction features and modes. Love the fact that it’s made differently than other wearable pumps and it doesn’t make your boob look weird. It’s very natural looking. So far I haven’t found anything I disliked. I will definitely be adding this to my pumping routine,human
My wife had a severe burn from boiling liquid. This product was absolutely outstanding in protecting the area. It's now healed.,human

"The RV repair place where we had a new floor installed left a can of this in our RV.  They said it would remove any kind of stain from anything.  They are right!  I use this product on grease stains on my husband's clothes and to clean up the grease spots on my black kitchen appliances. It doesn't have a really heavy petroleum smell like bug & tar remover that I have used for these jobs before.  I haven't used it on my carpet yet but I'm sure I will. $20 is plenty to pay, for sure, but a little of this goes a long way.",human
This really works to squeeze out the last drop of any tube. I use primarily with tubes of paint and only flaw is that sometimes the tube will split. I wish you could adjust the level of squeeze a bit.,human
Easy to use. I have developed warm feelingsfor this product.,human
"I just received this item and I hadn't even tried it on, but I could tell from the feel of it I made an excellent choice. If you need a head strap for plastic frames that slide down your nose (as mine always do), get this product! It is even better than I had hoped: the strap is very lightweight, you won't even know you have it on. I wear behind-the-ear hearing aids -- the pieces that attach to my frames are very thin and pliable and fit nicely in my crowded ear space! The part that goes behind your head has a velcro fastener with the very cool company name on it. The strap sits low on my neck and is hardly noticeable, even with a shaved head. This strap is well worth your money and will do the job perfectly! The only available color is black -- I would have preferred some other -- but because of how well it works, I can easily overlook the matter. Order today!",human
cheap price but not good. It doesn't hold the syringe securely. The MediCool ones which are priced high work much better. You get what you pay for.,human
Great! Came with zip up case and soft case + lens cloth!,human
toothbrush heads are super.,human
I love it they are perfect fit and as described are helpful,human
"I’m considering Palram roof panels for a shed I’m planning to build, but thought I’d give them a trial run on a dog house first. With a simple gabled roof, the ridge was the perfect finishing touch. They are pricey for what you’re getting (a 4’ section when an 8’ panel is half the price).",human
"How much do I LOVE this flat iron? So much that I bought a second one for my daughter less than a week after I purchased one for me! This flat iron heats up so fast (after the first use, I only heat to 350, it was that hot!) and the brush style bristles get hot, too, for an almost single pass through to achieve results. It gave us straight yet bouncy, sleek hair. My daughter and I have super thick, wavy hair and the heated teeth get every side of the hair was we pull through, every time. Be sure your hair is brushed prior to using as the teeth will snag a knot. I wish it had protective steam (like my last one) but with a lower temp, it hasn't damaged my hair yet. Love this and HIGHLY recommend!",human
Cool. No smell but you can use it as a car accessory,human
Awful way too small. I have a very large member but this feels awful and is very small. Not worth it .,human

"Bought this for my 91 year old mother who was using a traditional four leg walker. She was getting slower and stiffer. Now with the Winnie Go-Lite, she can move more freely and easily navigate anywhere. The breaking system is secure and she can operate it even with very arthritic hands.",human
"You can do much much better for this price.  However, I can get a decent shave from it if I need.  Workmanship is cheeeap, there are flaws and uneven surfaces.  It is on the aggressive side but it gets the job done.  It will test your skills.  I can't say I recommend it.",human
Fun design that went with out tie dye theme but the bags were really thin and they ripped easily.,human
Made my work day pain free and nighttime leg cramps almost disappear!,human
"This works great. Purchased for my autistic son.His grandpa made a platform for it based on the one found on www.autismfrog.com under the dyi bubble column platform link. I was able to purchase the wood for it in the value wood section at menards. Ours came with the colored balls, not the fish (we are happy with it regardless). There were no directions, but you just fill it with water to the max line, add the balls or fish, plug it in, and switch it at the bottom of the base. We plan to eventually add the non-breakable mirrors as shown on autismfrog.com as well.",human

"[[VIDEOID:8029a0208501abe359ec1ebab525d10b]] i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone in any way of my opinion of this product.This exfoliating hand and back loofah has a soft terry cloth material, they are not too harsh. This back scrubber is about 2 inches shorter than the one I just got and about  12 inch less in width. The rope handle on this one is also thinner than one I just got, But these still do the job.I love fact that I can reach my back without hurting myself. Both of my rotary cuffs are ripped, so these really come in handy. These are great for both men, women and children. My grand daughter is 8yo and she likes to use them. These help take off the dead skin for better, cleaner skin. Taking off the dead skin also helps so you don't break out.Another great idea to use the back scrubber: Lotion. Can never get that middle part of your back? Just dad a little lotion in the middle and use the back scrubber to apply the lotion. I do this all the time.",human
"There is nothing like a new clipper blade! Been grooming dogs for years, and I found this blade set worked great for me. Much better price than the brand name but works just as well. These are nicely packed. Super fast shipping! Fits my Andis and A5 Oysters clipper perfectly. Fits all my #10 guard combs perfectly. These are very sharp professional-grade blades. The blade cut smooths and even, without leaving any cut lines. I prefer this type of metal blade as it can be sharpened. Overall, they work great and would recommend them!",human

"I received my bracelet a couple of days ago and am pleased with it. It fits well, is obviously a medical ID bracelet that all medical personnel will instantly recognize, and the built-in software is basic, but serviceable.Downsides: If you are a large person with a bigger than normal wrist, this bracelet might be too small for you. I am a 210-pound male and it fits me perfectly. However, I know some people with bigger wrists who might have problems.The included software is a bit basic but seems to do the job. It has no built-in printing capability but I found it is easy to print: take a screenshot and print that. That takes a second or two and it works well. I'd prefer built-in printing, but this work around is simple and suffices. I suspect that all medical personnel and most everyone else can figure it out in a second or two. Then again, there isn't all THAT much information. I'm not sure anyone will really need to print it.I also copied a text file to the jump drive called EMERGENCY - READ ME.TXT that duplicates most of the information I entered into the bracelet's ID and then I added quite a bit more info besides. I gave the names and phone numbers of several next of kin, in case the two listed in the bracelet's software were both unavailable. I also added information about my medical insurance, car insurance (I am guessing this could be useful after an auto accident) and everything else I could think of. The EMERGENCY - READ ME.TXT file is easily printed.I am keeping the bracelet and plan to wear it all the time.",human
"This thing is amazing! It feels better on your scalp than you can put into words. I have a really dry but simultaneously insanely oily scalp. The result is that my scalp is always crazy itchy while my hair gets super oily really quickly. It's a nightmare. Since using this and other brushes like these, the itchiness has calmed down significantly and I'm able to spread my natural oils through my hair more evenly to prolong the time between washes. This is also amazing for deep conditionershair masks because it just really works the product in and moisturizes the scalp.I have tried several brushes like these but this one is by far my favorite because it is silicone all the way through vs plastic handle which just makes it easier and more comfortable to maneuver. Also because the tips provide a deeper, more comfortable massage than the brushes with solid tips.I love that you can use it on wet or dry hair. This is honestly such a great product that I wish I had been using for years past!",human
This product is amazing for cleaning the boat. It gets off any pesky spots and makes getting those tough spots clean a breeze. We will never use anything else.,human

"Amazon won't let me cuss in my review. But trust me I would love to cuss up a storm.I wish I could call the Better Business Buerau of China and make someone improve this product. Brand new arrays stop working RIDICULOUSLY quick. Some didn't work AT ALL. I have one left and feel like I might as well throw it away, as well. These are supposed to work AT LEAST 40 hours if you keep the machine at 2.4 amps (max). Good luck getting through 1 hour with it functioning. My 9th one stopped working after 40 minutes.  I think MAYBE two of them worked as much as 8 hours.VERY MUCH a waste of money. WHERE ARE THE GOOD ARRAYS?!?!?!?!?!! PLEASE SOMEONE tell me where to buy a functional product. I LOVE my ionic detox machine. I HATE how hard it is to find quality arrays. Zinger Electronics, I just left a 5 star review for the arm straps you sold me because they were the first to actually fit the socket. But now I'm wondering if that might be defective too.I Was REALLY looking forward to getting my complete detox on this February. Now I'm back spending time and money praying to find a decent product.TOTAL waste of plastic, metal, energy, and money. I feel so bad throwing these in the trash, even if recyclable.

"This product is worthless! This back scrubber would only be suitable for a 10-11 year old boy or girl. This is not even close to being suitable for an adult, with an adult back and an adult body! This is way to short, like a child's tinker toy. You have been warned, look else where!",human

"It's easily adjustable and easy to attach to mask's ear loops.  However, it'll keep sliding down from my head toward my neck.  Placing the mask loop above my ear helps but then it also puts some pressure to my ear.  Overall, it is better than wearing mask directly on my ears but doesn't work as well as I expected.",human

"If any wand developer has discovered nothing more than a way to detect and measure zero point energy it would be a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment. The ability to harness and control zero point energy, let alone all the profound benefits attributed to it, would be tantamount to harnessing and controlling gravity. It would be the single greatest scientific breakthrough in human history. And there would be at least one double-blinded, clinical study to validate it.According to Amega and other wand producers, ZPE somehow promotes cellular repair by ""reminding"" our cells to ""return to source"". That is, their original, undamaged, pristine state. This begs the question, why does Zero Point Energy only contribute to repairing cells we can't see? Why doesn't zero point energy repair skin cells of burn victims or those with eczema, psoriasis or acne? Why doesn't it reverse cataracts, or return the scalp cells of balding men back to ""source""? In fact, the only demonstrations we are ever presented are subjective, where the subject rates their pain from 1 to 10, and the injury is internal where we must only assume ""cellular repair"" actually took place. This is somewhat similar to charlatans like Peter Popoff and Benny Hinn who routinely heal trick hips and bad backs, but who can never seem to find any clinically blind, quadriplegic or stage-4 cancer patients in their audience, in spite of the hundreds that attended.Instead of demonstrating the miraculous powers of these wands on citrus fruits, old dogs or people with a headache, as you will find all over YouTube, why don't they send free wands to stage four cancer sufferers who are under hospice care and have ceased all anti-cancer treatment? That way there would be no doubt what caused their cancer to go into remission, they could save thousands of lives and end tremendous suffering, and these wand purveyors would heroically be front page news all over the world. And there would be a multi-billion dollar bidding war among pharmaceutical companies for the rights to this technology, and hundreds of new jobs created to dig the ten mile deep hole for them to bury it in.For the record, I have performed extensive research into ZPE wands, specifically Amega Global's AMWand, including blind field testing.

This form could help to carry the vitamin B12 deliver deep into body for better absorption.I am really happy I found this one. I would recommend to anyone if you are in the market for B12.",human
I really like that I can add flavor to my daily water intake and get my collagen in at the same time. This has good ingredients and the flavor is pretty good.

Love these earmuffs. Sound quality is decent and I like that you can remove the cord if you want. Can't beat the price.

"The three stars is not for the pool itself, which is pretty awesome, but since the company that sells it, Plumstruck, deserves zero stars, I compromised and used three.  Other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue, but since the description specifically mentions a ladder, I thought the problem was fixed. When Amazon and I both contacted Plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool, Plumstruck repeated ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included.  Since the pool is useless, even dangerous without the ladder, this issue must be addressed by the ad.  That being said, Amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price so if the company would just change their wording, people could figure all of this out in advance.  Amazon is investigating the company, so hopefully all of this will change.Some people mentioned a heater, but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description. I was actually worried it would only work with the heater and I didn't want to have to use a 220 outlet, so I was relieved that it doesn't have one. If I decide I need a heater later, I will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation. I will never order anything through Plumstuck again. They are a  horrible company. If you can find this pool through someone else, I recommend it. It is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage, but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workout.I also want to add that Amazon sells a salt water conversion system that my local pool store also sells (for a lot more money) that the pool representative says will work with this pool so I will soon be able to convert it to salt water.",human

"These are billed as 'medium' toothbrushes, they are super soft, like little kid toothbrushes.  I don't even feel like they are cleaning my teeth.  No bristle shedding observed (tried two of the pack so far).  The head and handle are a little rough, but I didn't not experience any splinters.  But if your mouth is so sensitive you need this level of softness in a bristle, the wood might be too much for you.",human
"I never thought I'd order a broom online....but years ago I bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom I had ever used. I have never found another since then that even comes close...I even replaced the old handle when it broke so I could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones I could find locally. So, I came online to see if I could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after YEARS of hard use...and low and behold...Amazon had one. I paid significantly more for this one than I did my original one and it's worth every penny. This one is bigger...I originally had the 9&#34;. The reason I like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it. I'd re-purchase this several times over, happily. It has made me a broom snob, lol :)",human

These diapers if you get the bundle packs off of honest.com will cost you as much as the organuc diapers bought off the shelf. The difference is that these diapers hold sooo well. My son was breastfed the first 6 months and breastfed babies poo alot and its always runny. Never had a leak. Organic diapers aling with organic wipes n cremes have been the only thing that has helped my son and his super sensitive skin. I highly reccommend the whole honest baby line.,human

This battery is even better than the original batteries that came with my hearing amplifier! So far lasting from 5:30am to 7pm. We’ll see how long it takes to start running down faster. Great buy,human
"This stuff is the absolute bees knees! I only couldn't give it 5 stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted so about 13 of it was already spilled out, so I had to clean it off and was left with what was still inside. The product itself..worked amazingly! My hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job. And even with gloves on the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands. This is the first thing I use as soon as I get home from a long day. The scrubber it comes with is stiff bristled so it holds up well. A little product on the nail scrubber, and its easily cleans all the grease and dirt right off. The product itself is a 1010, but they need to work on the packaging and getting it sent out in something more secure. I know delivery drivers smash up the boxes and so the original manufacturer can't be to blame. But if it were my product, I would put more filling or bubbles wrap the product to keep this from happening. I had a friend that had the exact same issue with this product arriving damaged. Solid product all in all.",human

"After reading many frustrated customer reviews, and having two separate personal experiences with what appears to be the current state of affairs with modern digital bathroom scales (for the majority of scales, you simple cannot get consistent repeat readings) this scale is the exception and just great.For some reason it seems to be really hard to design a digital scale that reads the same when you make multiple weighings one right after another. Whether the scale is too sensitive to subtle changes in the positioning of the feet, or it's some other factor entirely, I've found it's common to get over half a pound difference between repeat weighings.But not with this scale! The reading changes at most 0.2 lbs, and usually is exactly the same! Hallelujah.",human

I was surprised to find that not many brands offer a latex insole, and many advertise themselves as ""latex free"".  Too bad, because I find latex to be a very supportive and buoyant material and I went for a short walk with these insoles in my rykas yesterday and they were very comfortable.  The only downside is that there is not a good selection of sizes and I am a size 8 in shoe.  So my toes on my bigger foot could feel the bottom lining of my shoe, but the rest of my feet were comfortable on this insole.  I will definitely buy another pair, however.",human

"I hate the old fashioned squeezy lash curlers and had given up having curled lashes. When I saw that there were curling irons for lashes I was excited but was unwilling to shell out a lot of cash for something that might not work. This curler was really inexpensive and had no reviews, but it looked exactly like one that cost 4 times as much, so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm glad I did because it really works and has most of the features that the more expensive ones have - this is a win!Here's the rundown of what I like: It's rechargeable, so no batteries! it charges quickly and one charge lasts a couple of weeks. It has 4 heat settings. I've tried them all and even the lowest works well. It's easy to clean and has a cover to keep it protected when it's not in use. I do want to mention that the instructions advise you to put a coat of mascara on before you use the curler, and then to use another coat when you're finished curling. All of the curlers I looked at said this, but I've started just curling my lashes before putting any mascara on and it works just as well. Maybe better, because sometimes my mascara would clump when I did it the other way. It might just be me, but I like it better.This is a great curler at a great price - definitely worth it!.",human

First off, it had a weird strong scent, not a subtle neroli scent like the one I'm accustomed to. I sprayed some on my face anyway, and within seconds my face was itching like nobody's business.

"OK look - its advertised as a flame less candle. So, thus,  I foolishly expected it to look a LITTLE bit like a CANDLE.Much like other reviewers have stated, the biggest issue I have with this is the electric plug. I cant even create the illusion of a candle with that thing attached.The look is bad, the cord is a bad idea, and it in no way resembles a candle so much as a badly lit lamp of some sort.At least the smell is good, when you stand really close to it.Do NOT buy this if you value your money. Check out the other - ANY other version by any other company that does not have a cord attached. At least then you can pretend its a candle instead of some lame lamp that doesn't even light the area around itself enough to find the on and off switch.",human

Which is not good if you have no idea what you're doing. I almost want to take this kit down to my local tattoo shop and ask them how to set this up just in case I've been doing it wrong, because honestly, I have zero clue. I figured out the general idea, but that was about it.Out of the two guns, one arrived broken and will not turn on when hooked up. The other one stops working randomly, and I did double check and make sure that the cables were inserted fully. The guns themselves feel pretty cheaply made but look kinda cool. I do like the &#34;hardy&#34; look they have going on.I haven't used this on actual skin yet, as I'm definitely not an expert, and really never touched a tattoo gun until now...but the ink didn't have great results on the practice skin, so I don't think I would even attempt it on real skin, even with practiceOverall, I think this would be an okay starter kit if you're just wanting to learn how to set up a tattoo gun, and maybe tattoo the practice skins, or some fruit...but you'll definitely want an upgrade if you want to tattoo skin. Also, keep your fingers crossed that the guns arrive in working condition.I received this item at a discount  in exchange for my honest  review. This had no effect on my opinion of this product, and i would have said the same thing if I had paid full price.",human

"First the mat did not have a plastic cover over it, just mailed in a thin box, but no damage.  This is made in China if you want to know where.  It looks made well and strong. The brittles are firm but not going to hurt. But the suctions only half hold up. Probably good for feet not the back.",human
"Great for my toddler's eczema, very moisturizing and seems to soothe his flare ups. Works better than aveeno! Love it!",human
Great,human
The size and appearance are just as pictured. Suction works well. Stays on hands free and you have to really work to accidentally dislodge it.

"The five star rating is because they are so cute and a fun item to use on letters, packages, and the like.  I love to display my favorite animal on my cosrrrespondence to family and friends.  (Business correspondence - well, no.)  I'm an adult that has loved the panda since childhood and still collect figurines,  pictures, etc.  This tape is useable in any length of  tape or individuallly by cutting what is wanted.  Makes me smile when I see and use the tape. I definitely would recommend this prduct to anyone who loves pandas or just animals for a fun item to use.  I like the tape period.",human

This set has the perfect summer colors! I absolutely love and am a big fan of the glitter polished. Super halo and dimensional. Had a nice reflective. Others colors are bright and pigment. With one coat you’d be good to go!,human
"I looked for several weeks for this item in all the Grocery stores that I normally shop at. I live 130 miles from the nearest Walmart, so I was getting desperate for a replacement for the one that I did have. I had to keep sticking it back on whenever I tried to was something, and it was getting to be a real pain. I like and would recommend this item to make your cleaning easier.",human
I love this and will continue to order it.  I am new to this but so far so good!  Good !,human
"Given the opportunity to do it again, I would not have gotten the white cast iron enamel Kohler sink I always wanted, but too late. We got it and cleaning it is a pain in the neck. You need this special cleaner (though there are other brands of it) but you can't just use dish soap. This dissolves stains and metal pot marks. You cannot just wash the sink and you can scrub it. This is overpriced for what it is, and it is a downright shame you can't clean the sink traditionally with dish soap, sponge and water.",human

"I love this little fish. The purpose of the purchase was to have one place to put my glasses as I take them off to work at the computer, then &#34;hunt&#34; them down go elsewhere, to find them hidden somewhere, i.e. under papers, to the right... to the left etc; so this serves a great purpose. I am not an artist, but the paint quality seems good, the paint is thick and covers the fish well with no streaks and it is covered well, the ad's colors are accurate and perfect for me. Glossy but not overly, shiny. The colors are as depicted in the ad (see attached pics). The notch for the eyeglass frames is about 14&#34; (0.5 mm) at the bottom and 12&#34; (1 mm), see pic with ruler, thus the fish can accommodate a wide variety of frame thicknesses. My frames a very thin and while the fish works well it does take a bit of placement to balance the eyeglasses more of an awareness than extra work. The fish also seems more stable with hisher nose to the desktabletop. I would guess this as well with thicker-heavier frames. I removed the bar code sticker between the fin-arms and there was a hole, I don't know if it could go on a stand of some sort, ceramic dust also came out of the hole, revealing that the fish is mad of ceramic and not wood or plastic. All in all very pleased with artisanship and functionality.",human

"While the color shown in the Amazon listing is what I was looking for, the vacuum-packed bag of chips that arrived appear &#34;pulverized&#34;. The item description is for 14-inch chips, but I'd say that perhaps 10% of them are that big, and certainly none bigger. The rest are 18- or 116-inch and even smaller ... down to &#34;tan dust&#34;.

I've been using them along with my 3M Peltor earmuffs (full reviews of these on my Amazon profile) and the result is superb. When it comes to sleeping, there's no better friend. And because they come in a pack of 2 - yep, two cans full of earplugs! - you can rest assured they are going to stick around for a while.Great product indeed.",human

"PROS:Nice looking.Solidly built.CONS:Painful and unpleasant leg massage. It doesn't massage the feet with rollers like some other chairs, it only has a painful squeezing action using air bags. Even on the lowest setting, it was extremely painful.Feels ""low end"" in terms of features compared to other massage chairs in the 2k-3k price range.No memory feature - you have to recalibrate the massage heads for height and width each time you use it. It defaults to the original settings each time it turns off. Whenever you select a new massage setting, for a few moments you get a very uncomfortable massage while you have to wait to slowly move the massage heads to a comfortable position using the keypad.Shoulder and neck massage doesn't work well. Couldn't find a comfortable shoulder and neck setting and it felt weak.Faux Leather. But I think most massage chairs are using faux leather now.",human
"This face steamer worked well.  Fill it with water, turn it on and wait for the steam.  The steam took about 3 or 4 minutes to heat but after that the steamer worked well.  Easy set up and easy to use.",human

I paid a lot of money for something that broke within 3 months it breaking. And not just a cracked. It broke in half at the hinge. It is horribly designed. And isn’t compact at all.

"Like many women out there, I have a husband with a terrible snoring problem. His snoring is so loud, he often makes it difficult for me to fall asleep, or will wake me up in the middle of the night.  I bought this product after trying other nasal strips, nose inserts, and other items recommended by friends and family.My husband is a good sport and happily put the device on before we went to bed.  After a few minutes, he quickly fell asleep and I didn’t hear a peep out of him!  I was so relieved!I tried the device on myself just to see if it was comfortable and would be easy to wear. The thing I noticed was that although the device was extremely comfortable, it would slide around a little on my head. Not a deal breaker, but thought I would mention it anyway.If you have a snoring problem or have a spouse that does – you should really consider purchasing one of these snoring straps. It was definitely the thing that helps me get the sleep I needed.When I purchase an item, I rely heavily on the customer reviews to verify the seller's claim.

"Well, it did keep me from rolling onto my back, but I did not use it per the horrible directions.  Directions are minimal.  It has a picture showing strap to chest not waist, but doesn't say what the benefit of chest vs waist is.  The strap is awful!  It is rigid and bulky and feels like sleeping on rocks for the most part.  First,  I am a woman and strapping this across my breasts was not appealing or comfortable.  I tried just below and the strap hurt my ribs, so I went with the obvious choice and strapped it to my waist (as directions said not to do).  Worked fine strapped around waist.  I was unable to roll to my back.  I will be changing out the straps as they are uncomfortable.  I want straps that have some flex and are thinner.  I don't understand how this would facilitate good breathing strapped tightly around the chest.  This was the only product I could find to keep me from rolling over, so I am grateful it was available.  However, it could be more comfortable with better straps.  The directions are probably vague to avoid making claims so the FDA doesn't shut this down, but a bit about what the benefit of chest vs waist would have been nice especially as it is uncomfortable as directed.  It is also darn hard to inflate.",human

"The problem is the packaging is over-the-top. Guys, I don't want to pay for fancy packaging. Just put it in a bag, seal it, and be done with it. Pass the savings on to your customers. It's seriously wasteful to put this tiny amount of powder into a fancy bottle and bag. I know I'm paying too much when I see that. I know I'm not getting a good value when I see that. I think it's probably a good product. I don't notice any effects, but yet I trust it's doing something. It's probably foolish but I keep buying it because it's one of the only dual water AND Alcohol extracts. I will switch as soon as another alcohol extract comes on the market that's focused on value.",human
"I initially got the liquid version of chanca piedra, because I was in pain and needed fast relief and the pill estimated delivery was further out than the liquid. After I found the liquid version worked and I was getting low, I ordered the pill version. The pill version worked just as good as the liquid version and was a little easier, because it didnt require 3x's daily dosage and didnt require all the water (don't get me wrong you def need water with kidney stones, but its hard to work and function in life when you are constantly going to the bathroom). Anyhow, this stuff is great. I'm so grateful it is available and enabled me to take care of my stones on my own rather than giving my hard earned dollars to docs who btw never mention this product's existence.",human

The pen is harder to use than a tray or strips because it's hard to get into nooks and crannies but they generally do work. I just couldn't deal with the sensitivity. A hard no for me!",human
"I do believe this product works. I bought it years ago, and I can't remember what I paid for it or what site I went through, but I didn't have any issues with being overcharged, nor did I continue to be charged. One thing I have to point out though, is that I used Crest Whitestrips shortly before using Celebrity Sexy Teeth. I didn't notice any change in the shade of my teeth with the Crest Whitestrips, so I started using Celebrity Sexy Teeth as soon as I finished up the Crest Whitestrips. I noticed really fast results using the Celebrity Sexy Teeth. The name itself sounds like a scam, and thinking back, I'm surprised I ever gave it a chance, but I'm glad I did. Many people say it doesn't work for them, but maybe using two products (one right after another) had something to do with it for me. Not to bash Crest Whitestrips, but I didn't notice a single improvement after using them, until I used this stuff right afterward. Huge improvement.",human

"Darn it, I wasted my $$ for nothing. The suction is not enough to get my milk. If I go more than L4 it hurts even at L4 it’s uncomfortable for me. With my spectra I get 2 oz in 10,15 minutes (and that’s all I make which is not enough for my baby) with this I pumped for nearly 17 minutes I got 1 12 oz. and the worse thing happened when I tried to open it and pour milk into the bottle, the whole suction part came out resulting spilling all my milk. God I cried so much. Wish I could get my money back",human
Good product,human
They work and fit the brush ferfectly,human
"So giving this a try and since it's supposed to be mostly natural ingredients, I'm hoping it will not affect any other medications that I might be taking.  But if you've never experienced a Hot Flash or middle of the Night Sweats, It's HELL!  Mine were and are still so bad that I have to get up in the middle of the night just to change my clothes.  Initially when I read the packaging, I was a bit confused as in one sentence it says, &#34;Cools Hot Flashes & Promotes Perimenopausal and Menopausal health&#34; I'm not sure if the word &#34;Promotes&#34; is the right word to describe someone going through Menopause would want to hear.  I would think words like Prevent or  Help Slow the Process, are words that sound more comforting and reliable.  Every woman with hormones will inevitably have to go through this process and they want something that will work well, quick and help to ease the symptoms.  Hopefully I can see more of a difference after I finish the entire bottle.",human
It is strong in odor.Have not used it long enough . I need another 4 weeks,human

I looked all over camper web sites to find replacement clips for our RV sliding doors and here they were.  These are made of strong plastic but over time can get brittle and under pressure snap.  That's what happened to us and we were very happy to find them here at Amazon.  Good product and they keep our sliding doors closed when traveling.,human

Pink zebra has been the worst experience for me that I’ve ever had when ordering things online. Not only does the stuff I ordered smell like vinegar and cheap dollar store spray but trying to get it returned has been the worst experience and still NOBODY has sent me a return label or contacted me back. I’ve had to handle a trouble ticket as if it’s my job but the companies own supervisor Tanisha doesn’t care and makes you feel wrong for calling the Office to get things taken care of! It’s going on a WEEK and I still have nothing resolved!!!!! I might have to just dispute the charge with my bank and call it good and NEVER order from pink zebra ever again,human

Great energy pills. Can help you get stuff done or can help you get rock hard. This pill hasn't had any side effects and has been used a few times. Amazing price especially since they really work. They are not only for when you want them sexually but also work to boost your stigma and energy levels.,human
These capsules are not as large as some of the other brands.  These work great for me because they fit in my pillbox with my other pills.,human

"Updated:At first I really liked these sleep masks. I had to make a small adjustment, but they seemed to work well so I gave them four stars. Well, now that I have used it for a while, the red sleep mask leaves black marks from the strap all over my sheets. The black dye will not wash all the way out, so I have ruined a nice set of sheets. I don't know if this is the case with all the masks from this company or just mine. So beware when you purchase.These sleep masks are pretty good, especially for the price. You get two masks, two sets of foam ear plugs (which I don't use), and a carrying case. I really like that these are contoured over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyelid. The only reason they didn't get five stars is the nosepiece. I found it to be a little too wide. I had to perform minor surgery and cut out a small v-shaped piece of material from the nosepiece in order to make the mask block out more light from the bottom and take pressure off the bridge of my nose. Now they work great, but I probably decreased the lifespan of the masks. But for the price, I don't think that will be problem Time will tell.",human
This product did nothing for my back pain. Would not recommend.,human
"Has everything I could ask for in a hydrating drink with BCAAs. Flavor tastes more like a beverage than a supplement which is a good thing. Using the whole scoop may be a bit too strong for alot of people even when using a full sized blender bottle. If you were looking for more of an OG gatorade type vibe for your intra-workouts, I would recommend using a little less (which will also make it last longer).",human

"I like the fact that this is a SPF 30 lip balm, the main reason I purchased it!  The texture is smooth and glides on easily without being greasy or slick, perfect.  It's not thick, heavy, or ""grainy"" either, just the right consistency.  Very nice flavor without being overpowering or lingering too long!  I can easily suggest it for both men and women since it's not a shiny gloss!  It stays on for quite a while but if I do need to reapply I purchased the 24 pack (GREAT DEAL...only $1.00 per tube), so...I can do that freely, at will and as the mood strikes me with all I have to use...ha ha ha!

"I purchased these thinking they'd be like similar showershampoo brushes I've used in the past.  They're not.  These have more teeth, so when brushing your hair, the teeth don't slip through your hair quite as easily.  And they are not 'soft' plastic.Also, when using in the shower, I often clip the curved 'T' handle to the shower head spout.  Unfortunately, these won't stay put.  They slip off after a few seconds.  (The curved 'T' handle was the reason I purchased this model in the first place.  Most of the other models listed on Amazon have either loop or grip handles that can't be clipped to the shower downspout.)Lastly, I've noticed on one of these that the teeth shrank and deformed, apparently after prolonged exposure to my preferred hair care product.  This was a first for me, since I've used similar brushes for years without this happening (with others, you just had to live with the teeth falling out over time).  Apparently, the manufacturer felt that testing (or at least researching) the effects of different solvents commonly used in hair care products on the plastic used in these brush's manufacture was an unnecessary expense.  And that's entirely okay.  I'll just post a less-than-enthusiastic review and never buy these again.You'd think that something like a showershampoo brush would be easy to get right.  Apparently not.  Not recommended.",human
Absolutely trash. Looked and felt nothing like the photo. I even had to do a double take to see if I got the right item and that’s what it said it was. I’m shocked. This is the worst Amazon purchase I’ve ever made. Retuned immediately.,human
"This Vitamin C serum comes in a thick, milky gel formula that's odorless.  It glides over my skin effortlessly and absorbs instantly.  It's comprised of a premium formula that's so powerful, potent, clean and effective that you normally only find it in high-end spas.  This serum reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  The penetrating formula not only cleans and moisturizes your skin, it tightens ans smooths areas around your eyes, chin, neck and cheeks.  It works as a deep cleanser to clean out the oil, makeup and impurities from your pores so your skin reaches a healthier, more radiant look.  The hydrating formula allows your pores to 'breathe' by allowing refreshing oxygen to penetrate your skin.  It's a refreshing change from heavier creams and serums.If you read my reviews regularly, you know I've reviewed many serums, especially Vitamin C serums.  For this reason, I have chosen to use this review entry to share parts of an article that was published by My Awesome Beauty that's titled The Complete Guide to Vitamin C Serums.HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST VITAMIN C SERUM : 10 FACTORS FACTOR 1 - VITAMIN C FORMThere really isn’t a “best” form for Vitamin C because there hasn’t been that much research that shows which one is the most stable and still effective.When you are looking for Vitamin C, you should stick to the derivatives or actives that are tested and proven to work, like:ASCORBIC ACIDAscorbic acid has the most supporting research but it is also the most unstable and can be quite irritating at higher concentrations. However, if your skin can handle it, it is the go to active. Just make sure that the serum isn’t oxidized.Still, most companies prefer to use the derivatives because they definitely have longer shelf life, which is critical for a cosmetics company.MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATESODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATEMagnesium ascorbyl and Sodium (pretty much the same) are water-soluble derivatives of Vitamin C that many believe to be the best form of Vitamin C for use in skin care products.They believe this because it is less irritating and is more stable than Vitamin C. Even better, sodium ascorbyl (or magnesium) phosphate has the same potential as Vitamin C in helping with collagen synthesis while keeping the concentrations lower.In the end, for those who have sensitive skin or don’t want redness, sodium ascorbyl phosphate is probably a better choice than ascorbic acid.Still, sodium ascorbyl phosphate can still degrade when it isn’t stored properly or exposed to light and air. Following the “use by” dates on the packaging is a must to ensure your get a product that still “works”.ASCORBYL PALMITATEThis form is the most frequently used fat-soluble (soluble in oils) derivative of Vitamin C in skin products.It isn’t irritating to the skin and is far more stable than Vitamin C. Still, even if it has good antioxidant properties; it doesn’t boost collagen synthesis as much as other derivatives and Vitamin C does.So, if you are going to choose an oil-based product that contains Vitamin C, you want to make sure that it has ascorbyl palmitate.However, it won’t be nearly as effective as ascorbic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, or sodium ascorbyl phosphate.NEW DERIVATIVESThese derivatives are to be avoided because there hasn’t been enough study into their benefits.You might also find other derivatives such as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, which belong to the new derivatives that are slowly hitting the market.If you remember what we said about derivatives, (check the paragraphs above), most vitamin C derivatives on the market, including ascorbyl palmitate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, consist of the ascorbic acid fragment (ascorbyl) and a fragment of another acid (e.g. palmitate or phosphate).These new derivatives have multiple chemical fragments that are bound to a single ascorbic acid fragment that protect against the core Vitamin C.So, as you can guess, it is like having more bodyguards protecting the core vitamin C.They are said to be more stable compared to the other derivatives and Vitamin C itself. Some of these newer derivatives (particularly the tetrasubstituted lipophilic ascorbates) are also said to be more powerful in boosting collagen synthesis. However, you will need to put out a little more cash, which might not be worth it just yet as we still haven’t found enough evidence or studies backing up those new derivatives.TO SIMPLIFY IT, IF YOU HAVE:Normal or Oily Skin: use L-ascorbic acidDry or Sensitive Skin: Use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and redness.We will keep a close eye on the new derivatives and will update our article in 2016, so you can benefit from the most up to date information.NOTE: There are of course other derivatives such as a Ascorbyl Glucosamine, Ascorbyl Glucoside etc… but they really lack studies to warrant use so stay away from those forms for the time being.FACTOR 2 - WATER BASED SERUM OR OIL BASED SERUMIf your read carefully our previous paragraph, you should be able to answer this question.As you obviously want the most potent vitamin C serum, you will choose the most effective vitamin C forms : the oil soluble vitamin C derivative is not as effective as the water soluble ones, so you should stick with a water based vitamin C serum.You can also notice that all our top 3 vitC serums are water based because they definitely gave us better results. That is also why most vitaminC serums in the market are water based.The other advantage?These serums are much lighter and will be much easier to add in your skincare routine.As a reminder, apply the serum right after washing your face so to let the serum sink in and give you optimum results.FACTOR 3 - PERCENTAGE OF VITAMIN C IN THE PRODUCTThe percentage of vitamin C is a tricky factor for formulators (as was confirmed by our cosmetologist and formulator friend).You do need a high amount of Vitamin C to boost collagen production and help with hyperpigmentation but too much can actually cause irritation and redness – and you don’t want to make people have the catch-22 or being wrinkly or red.The goal is to find that just right spot – which can be harder than you think.The amount that you should look for depends on whether you have the Vitamin C form or the L-ascorbic acid or the derivatives:Ascorbic Acid: Look for 5-15% in the productMagnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate or Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate: Percentages between 1%-20% (remember that these derivatives are as effective in lower concentrations as ascorbic acid ).WORD TO THE WISEWhen you are using Vitamin C serums, and if your skin is pretty sensitive, you should consider starting at the lower end and work your way up to a higher concentration so that your skin isn’t put into shock. You could irritate your skin and make it red and inflamed. Your skin may dry out and peel, which is pretty much the opposite of what you want – dry skin can make you look wrinklier, as was the case for several of our readers and 2 of our testers with sensitive skins.Try to avoid pure Vitamin C form, like L-ascorbic acid, and work with a derivative around 1.5 or 3% for the first month. That was more than enough for their skin, which showed impressive results. Example here of vitamin c serum for sensitive skins.So the most important criteria is not the percentage but how much % of vitamin C your skin needs to get results and how much you skin can stand.This is a really personalized product and you need to find the right one for you – there is no “one size fits all” option.FACTOR 4 - PH LEVELSWhen trying to make a decision on what serum to buy, PH levels should be one of the most important things you consider. PH levels tell you how acidic the product is – the lower the pH, the more acidic the product is.Now, many people will believe that stronger concentrations of L-Ascorbic means that the product is superior to something with a lesser amount, but that isn’t necessarily the case. The serum should have a pH level of 3.5 max (preferably lower), or it won’t be able to penetrate the skin – which is why it needs to be acidic in order to be effective, but also why it can be an irritant for some people.Skinceuticals is the one that holds the patent for the lowest CE Ferulic serum available on the market, it has a pH between 2.5 and 3.0. Some of the more affordable brands aren’t that far above them though, with pH levels ranging from 3.0 to 3.5.They can’t make it the same because it will violate the patent – but it is still low enough to be effective.As for the derivatives, the pH problem doesn’t hurt as much because they can go for a more neutral pH.For example, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate has an ideal pH around 5 or 6, which is the pH of our skin. This is why some serums that use Vitamin C derivatives will come with a sensitive skin label.Serums that have ascorbic acid: ideal pH of around 2.0 to 3.0, which can be irritating for those with sensitive skin.Serums that have sodium ascorbyl phosphate: ideal pH of around 5.0 to 7.0, which should not affect sensitive skin.Many brands have a problem with pH, it would seem in our testing. The products weren’t well formulated and the pH was not within the ideal range for the best penetration of ascorbic acid. That’s why some people find vitamin C serums ineffective; they probably came accross a bad formulated serum to start with. Obvioulsy, we did not keep those useless serums in our top 3.FACTOR 5 - BETTER INGREDIENTS FOR EFFECTIVE TEAM WORKVitamin C by itself can help your skin, but there is a reason that many of the best products have more than one thing in it.You can’t use one thing and expect miracles, just like you can’t eat a diet of only kale and expect to be healthy…or happy.You need a little more help, which is why it is good to go for a product that has other benefits or beneficial ingredients.Look for products that offer tons of antioxidants, especially if you are trying to avoid aging.In some combinations, antioxidants can strengthen each other and go above and beyond what they can do alone.One of those additions could be hyaluronic acid, which helps to deliver moisture, which can reduce wrinkles.You could also look for aloe vera, green tea, rosehip, andor ferulic acid.Having more won’t hurt your skin; at worst it just won’t help it, so look for a product that will be able to deliver on more than one front.Update: You can find serum with 20% of L-ascorbic acid,( the most irritant form) but the percentage of vitamin C is not the only criteria to check, I definitely prefer less vitamin C, like 15% of vitamin C if it means getting several other potent actives in the same serum that will boost the vitamin C action.Remember also as we mentionned it previously, the higher percentage of vitamin C ( L- ascorbic form), the more irritant it can be…. So I know we all want the most effective serum but if you burn your skin… it is not really what you want. So be moderate and build up from there.Keep in mind that usually,The more vitamin C in the serum, the less other actives manufacturers will add. (to keep the production cost moderate)The less vitamin C, the more other actives manufacturers will add. ( as they have more margin to add other pricey actives)Of course, the choice will depend on whether you use other serums or not in your skincare routine. If you only use one serum, it is usually a good move to use a serum with a blend of super actives (vitamin C, acid ferulic etc..). If you use other serums, you can pick the serum with 20% L-ascorbic acid as you will bring other actives in the battle against wrinkles with your other serumsFACTOR 6 - SKIN TYPESEveryone has different skin types, from oily to natural to dry – and many of us have all three types at once.Some people will have better results with Vitamin C derivatives while others will prefer to use the L ascorbic form – it is really a testing game until you find the one that works best for you.If you have sensitive skin, a product with a high level of ascorbic acid might harm your skin and you should aim to work with a milder option.Some people will be able to use only a little at a time and work up to the stronger levels, while others will be able to use the stronger products from the start. If you are having problems, a useful tip would be to start by applying the product every other day and work up from there.Go by this rule of thumb when you are just starting out:Normal or Oily Skin: use L-ascorbic acidDry or Sensitive Skin: Use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and redness.FACTOR 7 - AVOID COLORED PRODUCTSWhen you search for products that have Vitamin C or any derivatives, try to find a product that is white or colourless.Any colouring in the product could hide the signs of oxidation that render the product less effective.You want to be able to see a yellowish or brownish tint.Of course, a lack of tint does not guarantee that your product is free from oxidation as the early oxidation stages are colorless….Some unethical manufacturers (they do exist..) will even add colour to their products so that you can’t spot the oxidation status – so they can even sell oxidised products without you knowing it. ( and they can hide the ugly truth )However, some only do this for marketing reasons – people equate orange or yellow with Vitamin C, so they tint it that so it looks better.Still, we recommend you avoiding vitamin C products that aren’t colorless or white.That way, you will be able to check the degradation status and as a result the effectiveness of your antiaging – product.FACTOR 8 - PACKAGING & STORAGEProducts that contain Vitamin C and its derivatives have sensitivity to air andor light that makes their quality degrade at a faster rate if they are stored incorrectly.Companies do their best in trying to create packaging that helps keep the products fresher for a longer time, they use opaque tubes, pumps, or air restrictive bottles.You will usually find amber dropper bottle or blue colored dropper bottle, which enables to protect the serum from light. (For your information, amber colored glass is said to protect a little more from light than blue colored glass, but the difference is not that important).What you must remember is to avoid transparent bottles (they cost way less for the manufacturer but it means for your Vit C serum a shorter shelf life….)Yet, to get the best results out of your product, make sure that you close them tightly to reduce the amount of air that can get in and place them away from light.Try to avoid exposing them to humidity – which means you shouldn’t store it in your bathroom. Many people like to store anti-aging products with Vitamin C in the refrigerator! If that doesn’t sound appealing, wrapping them in aluminium foil can help.Once again, make sure that you note the “use by” date on the packaging – they will be your best indicator of whether or not the product still has a change of being effective.FACTOR 9 - BRAND REPUTATIONYep, would you buy a product from an unethical brand that does not take customer service seriously?Would you even think of spending your money on a company that don’t respect you as a customer?You should also definitely check the brand reputation, check whether the brand is known for selling scams or fake serums.There are unfortunately thousands of crappy brands in the Internet selling you bottles of water with a simple gelling agent to make a serum that they would market as vit C serum.When customers start to complain, they simply take the money and shut down everything. Then, They can create another brand and rinse and repeat….I know it sucks but that is the bad aspect of Internet. As we told you, you will find thousands of vit C serums brands on amazon or other big e commerce websites, they all claim to be the best serum on earthWe bought many serums to test, and were really shocked by some brands selling crap so the big lesson to remember is to be critical….Keep also in mind our reviews don’t necessarily mean, your will get the exact same results as our reviewers. We all have different skin. That’s why we usually like to give you the criteria and elements to know so you can better choose the most suited serum for your specific case.FACTOR 10 - PRICINGPricing of Vitamin C products can vary greatly.Some of the best products from Skinceuticals are a luxury item while other brands are far more affordable. Of course there are a ton of products that fall right in the middle.Skinceuticals products are great, but they might not be worth the money (30 ml bottles for $100-120) unless you have tons to spend and use $1 bills in the bathroom. You can definitely find cheaper serums that are as effective. )On the other side, you also have the serums that cost $5 and swear to be the end of all your skin problems. Those brands are created everyday, which proposes serums for $ 5 with 20% of vitamin C + 10% of hyaluronic acid, + many other actives that are priceyYou look at the ingredients and see all of the buzzwords, so you think it has to be a miracle.Well, just like fake designer bags on Canal Street, these products tend to fall apart at the seams and not offer the results you’ve been dreaming of. Some of those products might claim that they are 20% Vitamin C, when you open them up and get a ton of water, you will realize pretty quickly that it isn’t.To sum it up, you can definitely find a good serum that will deliver somewhere in the $20-$70 range. Take advantage of sales and seasonal deals, as they pop up quite frequently.I chose to share the 10 Simple Criteria involved in how to choose the best Vitamin C serum because I found it to be very information.  I hop you can too.  I like this serum featured in this entry because it contains Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate.  This is one reason why my extremely sensitive skin does not react to it.  It's also water soluble which makes it more effective and doesn't leave any nasty residue.  There are also other beneficial ingredients present such as Aloe Vera and green tea.  Really, I cannot say enough about this product.I'll sum it up by saying this...This serum is comparable to other better known brands as far as the ingredients and other factors.  Yet, it's available at an affordable price.  Why pay more for the same thing?  I also like the fact they back their product with a 100% money back guarantee.  If you're not satisfied within 30 days of purchase, return it for a no-questions asked, 100% refund.  That's a guarantee you can't really sneeze at.**I received this product at a reduced rate**",human

"Review of the FootSmart Carepeutic Foot and Calf Beauty Massager with Infrared Heated Therapy, model Kh383I, Black, purchased directly from FootSmart 26Nov2010 for $119.99.Received this foot & calf massager as a Christmas present (2010).First Problem:The silver placard ""instrument panel"" had come off and was stuck on the side of the unit instead of over the lights on top of the middle section.  When placard was replaced to its proper position, it would again become unstuck after a day or so.Second Problem:The unit has a receptacle with two jack pins that the power cord plugs into.  The bases of the two jacks were not seated properly and prevented the power cord from being entirely inserted such that the plug itself would not seat properly.  When the unit was being used the vibration would cause the plug to fall out.Third Problem:When using the unit on my feet, the unit eventually damaged my left foot (rollers inside the unit squeeze the feet in an effort to massage them) causing pain for about a week.  A month later my left foot still feels sore on occasion.For the above three reasons I cannot recommend this product.  I am returning unit to FootSmart 18Jan2011 in hopes of getting a refund.TheShopper",human

It does take a couple hours of walking for these to ""mold"" to your foot shape, but once they are broken in they remain super comfortable.  Great inserts.",human
This product did what it advertised.  I purchased it to put medicated lotion on my back and it works.  Instead of having to deal with pads you apply the lotion directly on the end of the paddle and spread it around.  It is lightweight and easy to clean since the application part of the device is vinyl which wipes right off.  I would recommend it as a solution for those who live alone or need to be able to self applicate lotion or medication on areas that are impossible to reach on the back.  It also has a nice long handle which is a nice plus since you are able to reach all the way down your back with it.,human
"They work great. They're ear plugs. I got tired of using balled up Kleenex.

Doesn't matter as much if I'm doing yardwork or in a high noise environment.",human

"I have been on a ketogenic diet for 2 years. One of the problems is knowing what foods might throw you out of ketosis. There is so much conflicting information and of course each body is different. I have tried keto sticks but they are next to worthless. Although there is nothing better than a blood test to determine the level of ketones, the Ketone Breath Meter is the next best thing. You can't always believe the nutrients that are listed on a package. There are no regulations as to what constitutes net carbs. The only way that you can tell if the food you are eating is throwing you out of ketosis is by testing your ketone level about a half hour after you eat it. The Ketone Breath Meter is an easy, accurate way to do this. In that way you will know for sure.This little device is easy to use and seems to be consistent and accurate. Press a button to turn it on and wait for the 20 second countdown then blow into it for between 5 and 10 seconds. There is an audible beep which tells you when to begin blowing and another audible beep which tells you when to stop. It then displays your ketone level. A reading between .5 and 3.0 indicates that you are in ketosis. The first time that I used it I registered 2.30. To me this seems to be very accurate since I rarely have more than 12g of carbs each day.If you have cheat day or days then you probably will be thrown out of ketosis because of the carbs that you ate.  The Ketone Breath Meter will let you know how many days it took to bring you back into ketosis.  In this way you can judge whether the cheat days are worth it.The readings on the meter are large and unambiguous. It comes with 10 attachable mouthpieces and everything can be stored in a small convenient pouch. If you are serious about a keto diet you need to know your numbers and have the proper information about the foods that you eat. And the Ketone Breath Meter is an economic and convenient way to track your ketone level.",human

Its not overly sweet because it has no added sweetners. Its not mixed with other fruit juices either. Just the red prickly pear fruit puree , citric acid andor ascorbic acid and less than 0.05% grapefruit seed for freshness. Very easy to drink alone or in another beverage. I love this Nopal Eye prickly pear. I think its better than the high priced versions that I've tried. Great product and seller.&#34;",human

"I just noticed this and some other brands of carbonated beverages at Whole Foods in the last weeks.  I stopped drinking Coke and other carbonated drinks because of the high fructose corn syrup and the dense concentration of empty calories as spoken about by .  This brands has smaller servings, and less calories.1 Coke has 140 calories per 12 ounce serving meaning almost 12 calories per ounce.12 Ounces Coke 140 Calories12 Ounces Q Kola 105 Calories1 Q Kola has 70 calories per 8 ounce serving or almost 9 calories per ounce.8 Ounces Q Kola 70 Calories8 Ounces Coke 93 CaloriesAn 8 ounce serving of Coke has 24 more calories than an 8 ounces serving of Q Kola.A 12 ounce serving of Coke has 36 more calories than an 8 ounces serving of Q Kola.3500 calories in a pound of fat, so that is about 1167 ounces more of Q Kola you would have to drink toTo gain a pound of fat you would need to drink 25 cans of Coke or 33 equivalent cans of Q Kola,that is you can drink more Q Kola for the same caloric ""price"".I'm just saying that Q Kola tastes pretty good, complex, spicy, sweet and refreshing ... like Cokewith about 75% of the calories.Plus you will drink less because the bottle aren't 12 ounces, they are 8 ounces, though you canget 6 ounces cans of Coke now and they are cheaper than Q Kola.I will stick with some of these new drinks like Q Kola put my money into more reasonable andhealthy alternatives.That said I am trying to cut down on all soft drinks, and even juice, except real fresh juiced fruitsand vegetables.  I find these smaller less calorie dense drinks a help in that effort, and I also donot like to contribute money to Coca-Cola that has been going on for decades knowing they aare contributing to the sickness and obesity of Americans.--- By the way Q also makes a very interesting tasting ginger ale.  It is sharp and spicy and abit hard for me, a lightweight, to take straight, but on ice watered down, which is how I like itit's really excellent and sophisticated tasting.",human

I have friends that swear by Rhino brand and some by New Burro, Thumbs up (all the same company), and of course tadalafil and Sildenafil which NONE have worked for me. Unless the purpose was to make my sinuses feel clogged up and give me a headache.Fortunately after days of browsing I came upon AUXILIUM due to its introductory price, I didn't waste any time taking it and it didn't waste my time either. But like most supplements the claims are always a bit ""enhanced"" themselves. Sure I may have had an erection that happen at the wrong time for a long period of time however, these results are NOT consistent and what I experienced you may or may not. My body reacts well to the GoJi despite the risk of digestive discomfort. You can take one to two of these. WITH AT LEAST A 16oz BOTTLE of water. They tend to work better with water and less risk of head ache or that stuffy feeling which I didn't get from AUXILIUM. I wouldn't say I felt 5 star results but at least 3 stars. Which led me to try out the product that looks almost identical to AUXILIUM called ""LIFT ~ Rise to Your Potential"".  Slightly different ingredients and price. Same results",human

The fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is.  It really should be a bit fuller than it was.EASY TO TAKE?This is not difficult to take.  It is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink it.FLAVOR?I did not find the flavor offensive.  Some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag.

looks good for present to daughter.,human
"I just wish they would stop this one size fits all stuff. I like that you can put it from one hand on the other which is great since this way you can get one if you only have occasional pain in one hand or the other. It fits quite well and works well too providing support and pain relief.The biggest problem, it is quite snug and I wish it was a bit bigger. Not everyone's wrist is the same size and the strap that wraps around the wrist either needs to be longer or they need to have different sizes. Other than that this is great.",human
These pants work really well for overnight diaper changes. They are inexpensive and are a great way to bulk up your fluff supply. They aren't a close fit but cover the fabric well enough to prevent leaks.,human
Terrible. I have size 12 feet. These inserts were at least 4 sizes to small. They were also paper thin. Spend the extra money for Odoreaters or comparable.,human
These things are great for organizing batteries. This keeps them from rolling all over the place and also prevents them from draining their power inadvertently. The glow in the dark versions work well and I can see them being very handy during a power outage where you need to find batteries for your flashlight. My only complaint is that they don’t have a bigger variety of colors to help with organization.,human
Work great,human
You can buy a bottle twice the size at your grocery  store. Right is Amazon. The one on the left was $3 at my local grocery store in the first aid section.,human

"I have tried a few different kinds of silicone loofah while trying to replace the classic pouf. This one by far comes closest to what I am looking for. It is not flimsy, the bristles are the right length to make suds and also be easy to clean off. The detachable handle reaches my back easily. It's the right density to scrub but not upset my sensitive skin. Easy to recharge and the battery lasts a while. Would recommend trying it if you're looking for something similar. Wait until it goes on sale and save some $.",human
"This makes scrubbing your back so easy, I wish I had this years ago! No more shouting for my wife to come scrub my back (which she has refused every time) now I can do it on my own!",human

"I've used Neosporin products as my Go To Anti Septic most of my life. I must use the ointment now & no N. Cream because the cream contains PEG, & I am allergic to that since 2015 testing. I like being able to buy a 4 pack all at once for this decent price due to ulcerations on my lower leg. Thanks for selling on Amazon!",human
Great ingredient profile.  I personally like the taste...it's kind of like popping a few Flintsone chewable vitamins haha.  Energy was clean and lasted for quite some time without feeling all spazzed out.,human
"I feel better every time I’m used,N.B.must esk your doctor for advice about the maximum minutes in neck stretching , is vary important 😎",human
"Works very well!  The terry surface does catch more liquids. Easy to machine wash, but I chose to hanger dry.  Love the crumb catch on the bottom, which you can choose to use or not. Not using the crumb catch feature extends the length of the bib. The neck also has several snap closures so you can adjust neck size or how high you want the bib to sit.  Good product!",human
"Amazing, I simply love this mask. I went out looking for alternatives to treat my migraines, my fibro group suggested a migraine mask. I went on searching and can across this mask. I've used it about 15 plus times already within two weeks and honestly it helps me sleep and also helps with my migraine. Yes the print side where the words are, is definitely colder.Suggestion:  Grab 2, I should've done that from the beginning like the other reviewers siad, because now I have to wait for the next one to arrive. Thanks for the company that made this, it's a life saver.",human
I have been using this for years. It is fantastic. I always get razor bumps and with this I have not problems. A little goes a long way with this. Your skin will feel really soft and smooth too.,human
Overall it was a good product while it lasted but only lasted 2 weeks then died.,human
Love the style,human
It met our expectations beyond what we ever imagined I would highly recommend this product to any of my friends or anyone that is looking for a good product for their infants,human
"I've been sensitive to garlic for as long as I can remember:  I feel hungover the day after eating it.My Dad, and infectious disease doctor, hypothesized that I had desulfovibrio bacteria in my gut, which produce neurotoxins when given a supply of sulfur (garlic is high in sulfur.  He suggested that I try this product.After taking it daily for 2 weeks, I carefully ate a meal with a little garlic, and survived without symptoms.  I gradually ate more and more garlic at dinners over the next couple of months, and have never had a reaction.  I'm cured!I don't know if I will need to take this every day for the rest of my life, or if I have permanently changed my microbiome.  I should experiment by stop taking it and see if my cure is permanent, but I am reluctant because its not that expensive and I don't like the symptoms.Thanks Suntory!",human
I have a few problems that taking probiotics help.  I've been looking for an easy to swallow one per day pill.  This one is easy to swallow and has all I need in one pill for the whole day!  Ive had bad experiences with larger pills and on top of that I would need to take two or more a day. I noticed within a week of taking these that my bloating decreased and after a few more weeks completly gone.  Ive been on a healthy diet and the side effects is a bloated stomach which has been frustrating. I am so happy to be able to get rid of the gas and bloating in a one a day easy to swallow pill!,human

"A girls Sweet 16 birthday party is cut short by a series of murders.Gorgeous art, with the promise of an intriguing story line, the first 2 issues of this series are looking good. Murder, police work, a conspiracy, and delusions of being a vigilante Sailor Moon; Mia Goodwin is putting together a narrative that has the potential of being an underground hit.Definitely a series to keep your eye on.",human

"Recieved it in a timley manner. Felt it was a little expensive especially with shipping.Couldn't tell any difference from any other protein drink except it upset my stomach. I doubt that I will order it again. If I could get it in a store I ""might"" purchase it again.",human
Amazing!! I was looking for a shake similar to Shakeology. This has better ingredients and I like that I can get smaller servings. I thought the taste would be lacking. It's not!! This is hands down the best meal replacement you can buy. The Aztec chocolate has such great flavor!,human
"Love this product. Cannot find in stores. Moved to the country, and chiggers galore.",human
I love the whole cd,human
has a pleasant smell without being overwhelming. took care of the odor in the shoes.,human
The brush is too small for an adult. Perfect size for a child and vibrates well.,human
Very easy to cut yourself with these...,human
Was hoping for something easy to take on and off and not around ears....the adjuster doesn't hold for size and it doesn't stay up. Very uncomfortable and impractical,human
I bought these to drive in the snow when the light is flat. These great work great they brighten up the contrast so you can see better when you’re driving. Good product.,human
Will purchase again,human
"My fiance and i go on trips around the country a few times a year.. and we usually purchase a poster for every city we have visited. When we were in Nashville we had a hard time finding one we both liked. When we returned home, were very disappointed we couldnt find one we both liked. so like we always do when we can't find something..... We turned to amazon! This is a great item! Good quality!  We receive a lot of compliments from visitors",human
"The perfect decorations for my retirement party. LOVE the Tiara! It’s well made and sturdy. The banner letters are large and sturdy as well. This pack contains well made items that aren’t cheap, thin, or junky. Very nice.",human
Wow! Blown away by this game! The graphics are great on ps3 so I can only imagine what ps4 would be like. This game is very easy to play and very realistic. It will play on a US playstation with no problems at all. Still surprised that something this good was withheld from the US.,human
"Super yummy, and convenient packaging for individual serving.  Would highly recommend.",human
"[[VIDEOID:afd7efcc02fc31c5e2809800086f1e82]] This is more of a beard trimmer than hair clippers...My Wahl trimmer has seen it's better days so I thought I would try out this ""hair trimmer"". My first impression is that it isn't the same quality as the Whal. The base of the trimmer is all black plastic, I wish it had a little better grip... like rubber to keep it from slipping out of my hand. It seem to cut pretty good so far (anything is an improvement at this point with my old existing trimmer). It isn't terribly loud. It does not have a 3-defree turnable blade. Also, no comb, scissors or oil included. The guards are a little difficult to put on at first, but I think that is just because it is new & a little stiff. The guards are 3,6,9 & 12mm. It also come with a shaver attachment. The charging cable works with a USB type plug. It does included is a cleaning brush & velvet bag to store everything in. I will update with how well it holds up, but so far it is just an ok product.",human
Great product idea! This was one of the better prices I found. Full price of [...] is high for this accessory. Seller provided a very fast delivery. Great seller to buy from.,human
"I finally found something that actually works and keep my itchy back from drying out.  I am short and have short arms, this gives me the ability to really scrub my back.  It's a keeper!",human
"This was a rip-off, so much so that I am returning the product. The price per tablet is about 10X more than you would pay in a store. Also, it was unclear how few tablets would be in the box when I purchased this.",human
Tablets are really big.,human
I gave this four stars because I wish they sold more bang for my buck.  Smells good and I like it.,human
Works perfectly for someone who takes many pills,human
"Lids are bulky and feel cheap. The small side is VERY small, cannot clean by hand.",human
"It heats up but only in the top part. It basically keeps the back of your neck warm, which isn’t all that Effective",human
I had an issue with this product and customer service resolved it promptly.Thank you very much!,human
Very thick socks. Had to throw them away felt myself unleved from the ground. Maybe the gelly within the socks make it hard to walk. Dont waste ya money. Unless you like the dizzy feeling when walking!,human
Will have them for many years to come. Well made.,human
My kids and I take this for fibromyalgia (along with a protocol). It has given us back our lives.,human

The selfie stick is easy to use and easy to hold.  I love that it has the bluetooth remote.  So much easier than setting the timer for selfies. It extends to a good length and the tripod is a great bonus!  Love everything about it!,human
"This spiked yoga mat for women was exactly what I needed for my back pain. At first, it was a little difficult to get used to the acupressure spikes because they are a bit sharp. But that’s what makes them so effective! Great for lying on your back, sitting in your chair, or practicing yoga positions. I used this therapeutic mat for my chair in the office and noticed it felt great on my lower back, relieved soreness, and helped with posture. Highly recommend!",human
very small.,human
I have had acid reflux for years and forgot my medication when I went to London 4 years ago.  I found a holistic pharmacy and she suggested this and I was stunned at how well it worked and I have been of meds and use this only.  Great find,human

previous one looks more dark,human
Doesn’t keep water out of ears and they fall out easily.,human
"In several medical studies with beagles and with aging rats, it was shown that cognitive ability in the aging increased with this supplement. I’ve been taking this for years, and Walmart decided not to stock it. It’s more expensive to buy these two as individual bottles. Many sellers carry either one or the other. I hope Spring Valley hasn’t decided not to manufacture this product.",human
Its good. But small.,human
"Very nice synthetic shaving brush, comes nicely packaged too. Would make a lovely gift. Using it with my scented bar soap in place of aerosol shaving creams. Ladies like to have smooth legs and underarms.The brush is great, works up a fine lather, rinses out great. Wouldn't even consider buying a brush made of badger hair. So cruel, sooo unnecessary!!Can't understand why anyone would want one. Try this...and be a pal to an innocent animal.",human
These are the best tasting and easiest to chew gummies I've found.,human
Exactly what I needed to gift Chocolate covered espresso beans and almonds!  Also used it to pack up buckeye Christmas cookies and chocolate chip. Worked well for the buckeyes. Only got four or five chocolate chip cookies per bag and they were hard to get in and out.,human
"My vet put my dog on these 6 years ago to avoid surgery on his hip.  I put 4 in his food twice daily,  in the past 6 years he has limped twice when I ran out of this med.  in 3 days he limped - but stopped limping after taking again - highly recommend!",human
"Works great, one of my kids who was using this protein gain 15 lbs of muscle in about 2 months. Crazy change, really surprised by the outcome.",human
"Although this container is for pills, I bought it for my Fitbit Alta tracker for when I do pool aerobics.  It does not leak so I'm sure your pills will stay dry.  The chain that comes with it is also handy to wear around your neck.  Love this product.",human
"I bought this because it claimed to be organic and contain organic ingredients, but absolutely NOTHING on the bottle label supports those claims. The labeling shown in the ad that references organic is not any part of the product label. The narrative calls this organic bubble bath. Sadly, it doesn’t appear to be. Either the product descriptions need to be corrected or the product label does. This was a lot to pay for non organic bubble bath.",human
other brands are much better Quality,human
"Unless you have a really big head, i'd be mindful of buying these, as they are quite large. Also, the bifocal portion of the lenses wasn't the best. Product was returned",human
This was wobbly and not safe in my opinion.  I returned it and purchased a different brand that felt more secure.,human
Just what we wanted,human
What I was looking for,human
These are great glasses especially for the price. Clear at the top of the lens and a designated area for reading enlargement. They are also very stylish.,human
"These are by far the lightest pairs of glasses I've ever owned and I've been wearing glasses for 60+ years.  The optics are great and due to their size it's super easy to just let them slide down your nose a bit so that you can look over them when needed.  The fact that they don't have a rim around the top makes 'em as easy to use as expensive progressive lenses.  I got mine for doing computer work.  My distance vision is fine so if I'm working at the computer and have the TV on, I can just turn my head, look over the top of the glasses and I've got the TV in focus without have to mess with the glasses.  Also great for reading and watching TV at the same time.  They are not blue light blocking which I consider a big plus.  I get tired of the tint on the blockers.  My only minor complaint involves the cases.  They're very light duty.  Even the cheapo plastic cases would have been better.  Again, a minor complaint.  Love 'em and highly recommend 'em.",human
These glasses fit my 6 year old boy perfectly. He does like them but I had to encourage him to use them every time he is looking at the screen. He has had them for about a month dropped them sat on them and still in perfect condition. A great inexpensive way to teach your kids how to care for eyeglasses in case they every need prescribed one’s which are far more expensive to practice on how to care for them with your kids! I tried them on myself and it immediately felt like my eyes were much more relaxed. This is very protective against harmful blue lights from long-term screen use but also if you suffer from headaches this is a good thing to try. I will be buying the adult version for myself !,human
Very poor quality and poor packaging. Ask did not include 2 of the attachments in the image,human
"I used it on my DRY hair and after one section, the light turned red again. So I had to wait for it to reheat. It happened after every single section. I guess the technology with the cordless flatirons is not where it needs to be yet.",human
Love these for my business,human
"When I ordered these, they were color coded. They arrived with no color coding. These types of packs usually have separate compartments for morning, afternoon… well, the compartments are there, but backwards. They read right to left, not left to right. Evening is first, then afternoon…..moving to morning last. This is for a person with dementia that has different caregivers coming in to help with meds. The labeling is designed to cause confusion and subsequent mistakes in medicating the patient.",human
"I thought description said 11 shoe size fit. Maybe fits small.. Very nice very soft cushioned feel, wish they were a little closer to size 11 fit.",human
Love this stuff!,human
Great price for a great product! They work very well,human
"Nice massager. Sometimes it does randomly shut off, but it does get used a lot.",human
"This is refreshing drink in place of say a pop type drink. Something to cool you off on a hot day. Boone, Iowa",human
"I would have to use 3 of these for this to help route my standard surgical mask more comfortably. Maybe my head is just too big, but I didn't find these all that helpful. For children, this may be perfect and keep them from having the mask hooked by the ears only.",human
"This automotive heavy duty radar flush and cleaner is good. i received a set of six bottles of this product, and overall it works well. This is a good radiator cleaner overall.",human
Used for help with lowering bad cholesterol,human
Perfect for what I needed.,human
Very good for insect bites,human
It's best to take battery out when you're not using it. It runs battery fast,human
Great oinment,human
Ok to use with adult supervision in case kids wanted to step on. Fragile cause glass!!!,human
"I started using this after my doctor told me I needed a hip replacement.  I was in pain all the time, especially during sleep hours.  This unit is expensive but worth it.  Pain has been significantly reduced, and I postponed surgery.  I’m able to ride a bike and hike in the mountains.  What was once horrible pain is now just some discomfort.  My doctor thinks it is quack, but my results tell me otherwise.",human
Used them to fill up with stuff from the piñata.They are of cheap quality and ripped easily.,human
"I bought this item to use for wrinkle prevention. I saw the ingredient on the Dr. Oz show. I mix it with face cream after my sunscreen (or at night) and apply it to my current wrinkles and where wrinkles like to go, then let dry--forehead, nose, eye area, around mouth, cheeks, neck, chest. It does not sting. It's suppose to keep the skin healthier, thus preventing wrinkles--do some reseach on it. I guess the jury is still out because this product is suppose to help you over time, but I gave it 5 stars because I have hope!Cons: This product smells very bad! I mix it with face cream with a scent to cover up the smell.",human
It all arrived on time and I really like the product.,human
Berry good quality,human
It was the cheapest I could find. Works very well.,human
Great on my fine hair! Easy to use and fast!,human
"There are actually somethings I like to research when I buy them. Rachaa is a product that I know Im going to love taking because i am a woman of a certain age and menopause is beginning to sneak up on me. This product main ingredient also helps with early stage of meno. Although it is being sold as an upper region enhancement pill which is awesome. You get two for one, no more mommy sag from feeding the kids and a relief from private summers. This is a 2 month supply only 1 pill a day before or after dinner, its a small capsule easy to swallow. The seller was quick with shipping and professional.I did receive this product for my honest review.☆UPDATE☆very happy to say my &#34;Aunt Flow&#34; came to visit, she usually stays for 7 days, but out of nowhere it was only 4 days. Id still be taking out the trash every two hours if she was here !...Just thought I'd share, I know it's bc of these pills the ingredients has a lot to do with &#34;Aunt Flow&#34; leaving so suddenly.",human
Lasts for 2 years in my high-mineral-content water. Recommended.,human
I used to buy this when I lived in Japan and I am so happy I finally found it on Amazon! It’s my favorite scent. I can’t wait to buy more!,human
I’m pretty upset that it looks nothing like the stone in the picture. Not only did I order this piece because of its healing properties but also because it was truly visually appealing. The stone I revived is a muddy brown color ... not even remotely red... super super disappointed.,human
Gives you that extra kick you need when working out,human
