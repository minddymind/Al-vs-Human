"GREAT BAGS FOR OLDER TYPE COMPACTORS, ( 18 GALLONS), VERY STRONG NO RIP.  HARD TO FIND THIS BAG IN STORES",human
Pros-pit does the job at keeping you straight.Cons-Aruba horribly on your shoulders. Gave me a horrible headache.,human
Compacts easy to store and great for larger or large quantity of pills. Got it for my husband as a weekly pill organizer since all others were not working for the amount he takes on a day to day,human
"[[VIDEOID:a68d86215ccd16a8bf49ee6069682ac]] Trigger warning: video contains my earwaxes. Skip the videopart if you are easily triggered. I did it for review purposes so people know what they‚Äôre buying. Okay so this product contained the main tool that you turn on and off, comes with a cord for charging. It also comes with different sizes of scope, also included are metal instruments that you use separately. They don‚Äôt attach to the otoscope. There‚Äôs also a bunch of cottonbuds included. So you have to download the app, took forever to download it. Once done, I started geeking out my ear. Mind you, this is the first time I used anuthing like this, I just use a q-tip to clean the outer part as instructed by doctors but I‚Äôm curious. So i turned it on, there‚Äôs microlight surrounding the tip of the pen, then i attached the scope. It‚Äôs a bit blurred at first but i just though okay, it will get clear once I put it in my ear. Good grief! You can‚Äôt really see what you‚Äôre dealing with here. I even tried it with husband and i can‚Äôt see a damn thing. **see video if you‚Äôre brave. Plus i got scared when I saw my eardrum. This is cool but I‚Äôll probably not gonna use it again. It scared the **** out of me plus the camera is not clear at all even if it‚Äôs on focus mode.",human
"I own 4 different dust masks that I keep onin various mowerstractors on a ranch, and I‚Äôve replaced the filtration-bypass valves in the past with other products that fit and worked perfectly, but these DO NOT WORK because they won‚Äôt fit, as others have stated in the numerous one star reviews for this lousy product.Additionally, shipping from China took two months for this garbage to get here.",human
So so,human
"Description said yellow, photo shows gold. I contacted them prior to ordering asking specifically if this ribbon was yellow or gold as we want them for wrapping around trees for a returning soldier in our neighborhood so needs to be yellow. Received a response stating they are yellow so I ordered a roll. Received the order and they are not gold they are not even yellow but BEIGE, TAN, I guess you could say LIGHT GOLD. First photo is to show real yellow vs what I received, second photo to show yellow ribbon I had on hand.",human
Difficult to see the the star fish,human
Worked great only a couple times then stopped working. Tried everything to fix it! Emailed the company and received no reply. So unhappy.,human
definitely helps keep my spare bathroom sink from smelling like mildew. Helps keep the kitchen smelling  fresh as well.,human
Didn‚Äôt work,human
"I bought this because I have been having trouble with hair loss. I've only been using it about a month, so it's too early to say if it will help with that but I can say my hair looks better (not as dull looking.) It does seem to have helped with my fatigue, too. (Probably the Vitamin Bs??) Overall, so far, I like this. I'll continue to use it.",human

"I had an Omron that stopped working after quite a few years and was looking for a deal on another bp monitor.  Kroger had one for under $30, but the readings are at least 25-30 points above my normal systolic number and about 10 points above my diastolic number.  I kept taking it during the day and the numbers just kept getting higher.  It was very alarming, and I would love to bring it back.",human
Bought this for my husband who has a lot of neck problems from wearing heavy flight helmets. This works great. It lifts his neck gently and relieves the pressure causing the pain.I 've had 3 neck surgeries and am loaded in metal so it's definitely not for me but perfect on husband who won't have surgery.,human
"At the beginning I was reluctant to believe that omega-3 will help directly in my dry eyes but I am glad to say that actually works. I have Sjogrens and my eyes are very dry during the flare ups. I have being using this for 15 days already and it is working. I am happy with the quality of the product. The pills are dark, and I think this retards oxidation of the oil and I don't have fish-burps afterwards. Thank you!",human
"The Denas device works just fine. These pads, however, don't work at all. And they're quite expensive. And if you open them to actually use them, then your up sh*t creek because they won't accept returns. Pass on these pads.",human
"I opted for this scalp massager to use with my argan oil and rosemary oil to help stimulate hair growth. The brush has an ergonomic handle that fits well in between your fingers and rests well in the palm of your hand. The silicone bristles are soft and not abrasive when you use them on your scalp, but yet firm enough that when used in circular motions on your scalp, I personally feel confident in its ability to stimulate hair growth. Time will tell though. It's fortunate that it came with two; I made a mistake in showing these to my cat and gently rubbing it on her head (of course not with any oils on it). She closed her eyes and kept rubbing her face all over it and proceeded to drool, lol. So now she has claimed the second one as hers, but that's ok. Human approved and Cat approved.",human
I have had a few of these. This brand is the best. The feeling on the lips is nice and smooth with a nice thickness.  It enhances your natural tone and it looks completely natural. This is my second tube!,human
Reordered tape... First time I received the correct items....The second order I received dish scrubbing brushes. Wth??!??!?,human
"My son is almost 9yrs old.  He had been wet EVERY single night since birth. He would often wet through pull-ups.  It was really starting to effect his self-esteem.  Sleep-overs and scout trips were difficult.  We had tried limiting fluids, waking him during night to use bathroom, we had even tried Prescription medication.  We had also tried another ""alarm"" called the Potty Pager.  It was difficult to use, uncomfortable, and ineffective.We started using this wireless alarm since comfort was a big deal for my son.  It worked in just a few weeks.  When he did wet, it was usually just a few drops and it woke him and he could finish in toilet.  Usually even the sheets were still dry - just put new underwear on and back to bed.  It made the whole process not disruptive at all!  I know it sounds cliche but I wish I had gotten this system a LONG time ago.As product stated, the first few nights my son slept through alarm.  His room is 2 doors down from mine.  I am a fairly light sleeper and it would awaken me, and I would go wake him up.  After just 2-3 times, the alarm would wake him up.",human
"Our 8 year old son is a very heavy sleeper and had only been dry a dozen or so times in his life.  Our pediatrician recommended the Nite Train-r, and our son was really excited about the idea of the alarm.  He didn't have any problems or discomfort from the pad.  We did have a couple of false alarms, but it just shows you how sensitive the pads are -- meaning that at the first dribble, the alarm will sound.  It took less than 10 days and my son has been dry and wearing underwear every night since -- not one accident!  The alarm only sounded probably 3 out of those 10 nights, and that's all it took for his sleeping brain to get it.  I wish we would have known about thistried this sooner!  It does seem kind of expensive for what it is, but I figure that we have saved a bundle in pull-ups, and it can easily be re-used or re-sold as used.  All you would need are the inexpensive replacement pads for either male or female.  Amazing product!!",human
Me.gusta porque los he usado pero no puedo enconcontrar los palos de la base,human
"These lenses are very well made. They are quite clear and the magnification is true out to the very edges of the lens. They are genuinely spring hinged, not like some of the cheap ""spring hinge"" frames which aren't ""springy"" at all and will break if you apply any pressure. I actually stepped on these and didn't ruin them. My biggest complaint is that they are heavy. They hurt the bridge of my nose if I wear them for long periods of time. Other than that, I think they are very good.",human
Wish had come already assembled and with 14&#34; connections instead of 12&#34; connection because  it's a bitch to put together and it requires that you put it together after the hoses are feed through the counter. Almost sent it back because of how difficult it is to assemble. Had to turn the water down to prevent it from hitting the front of the sink. Now that it is in and the adjustments have been made is awesome. Love It,human
"Fantastic little boxes! Holds a week's worth of my pills, plus a lot of extras, even for someone like me that takes a lot of meds. Closes securely, no fears of spilling, and I can lift the entire inner lid off to easily refill them for the week.",human
stepping my conc. game up a few notches-I have had this a while and it still works as new-it has stayed firmly secured to the kettle-adjusting temps is easy and quick. Thank you Heatvac-your products and service after the sale is second to none.,human
This product was purchased by another company.  It has different ingredients from what is on the label of Traumeel Oral Drops.  Really disappointed...LOVED Traumeel Oral Drops which are no longer manufactured. :(,human
"This works great, as long as you don't try to reapply after sweating. If so, then it will streak, and you'll end up with streaky burns from the sun. See, this stuff is so hydrophobic that sweat or moisture actually beads up on your skin (think of a waxed car). This also means that it's very tough to get off in the shower, and it clogs the heck out of your pores. I ended up having to use astringent after showering to keep from looking like a teenager.",human
Perfect size. Perfect fit. LOVE!,human
"Having lived through so many devastating wildfires in the past several years along with weeks of breathing the smoke from the ""smoldering woods"", who would want air freshener that reminds them of these tragedies?  It's not the scent I'm concerned about; I haven't yet smelled it.  It's the description that is so disturbing. Somebody dropped the ball.",human

"Finding funny cards is difficult depending on who you send them to.  I bought these to send notes to my sister and cousin.  I love the non offensive animal humor.  It lightens up the mood and gets a chuckle out of them.  Perfect.  Great price, too.",human
the wife loves this product,human
"I love the curls texture, just a little a sticky residue but a little coconut oil can did that.",human
Scent doesn't last too long and it's pricey,human
"After a couple nights of getting used to the pressure on my chin, I slept better and my partner tells me there is no more snoring sounds. Further, I feel that this deals with my sleep apnea without wearing the mask and having the machine running all night. Thank you for this product that really works.",human
This kit are great value and quality are great as well.,human
My mom last month had to use this to keep her swallow properly and this product does not change the taste of her drinks as much as some of the others.  She preferred this,human
"Great for camping or your purse for any cleanups. I don't think it's worth the money though - they're not SO high quality that it's worth it. Individual packing and natural is why I liked them, but won't be repurchasing.",human
Great quality!,human
"This type of silicone sponge does not work very well in scrubbing action.  The silicone ""teeth"" tend to break off too easily when scrubbing stubborn items stuck to pots and pans.  It is ok for light duty dish washing but that would defeat the purpose of a scrubbing sponge in the sink.  Overall it is not very durable and is not recommended.",human
"I was hesitant about buying theses after reading reviews stating they did not stay on.  I put them on 3 pairs of cheap plastic readers over a month ago and they have not budged.  Trim them to fit before you remove the backing,",human
There's a small learning curve here but otherwise works as advertised,human
"Used this product with my coil cleaning solution and couldn‚Äôt be happier. The first one I received was not fitting together and still had solution residue and Amazon quickly replaced it and the new one worked flawlessly. Easy to set your dilution ratio, easy to use and the 100 percent money back from the company sold me in comparison to the other brands.",human
I put the gel on my feet and within 30 minutes my feet was burning so bad I immediately tried to take it off. It is definite NO-NO for me. I do not recommend this gel to anyone. It felt like acid on my feet and I am solely disappointed in this product.,human
"I was really impressed by the price and the quality of this cutlery. I would definitely recommend it. I used these forks, knives, and spoons for my wedding, and guests loved them! I wanted an eco-friendly option that was cheaper than renting silverware, and these were a perfect solution.",human

Works great as described in detailz. I had a small version and loved it so much i had to try to big boy.... yup just as i thought. ...i love it.,human
"This is very poor compared to the GAF product.  It is thinner, tears easily, the peel off backing shreds making it extremely difficult to lay down the underlayment while peeling, all while in an awkward spot on a roof.  The overall quality is very poor.",human
The sleeve is shitty. Couldnt even fit my cock through it. The suction is shitty for dicks but does wonders if you want fat fingers. Only fingerling potato dicks can benefit from this product. I watch Marcus and dont get fooled by camera tricks. Secondly the measure is off by an inch exactly. Its 9 inches not eight. Ive measured myself enough to know that. This shit can suction properly to give you girth cuz thats maily what it will do before you see any length. Penis Exercises have worked better so far. Jelq away review readers.,human
Super fun!,human
"Nice looking, great option for personal hand towels for guests during Covid.Your guests don‚Äôt have to share a common hand towel.They are nice looking napkin option as well. Good quality.",human

"good bite, good price, good quality. Am happier than my nipples are thats for sure ;)",human
"I liked this hand lotion a lot. It has a 'waxy' feel to it, not greasy at all.  When you rub your hands with it, your hands don't slip at all. What I'm trying to say that while it is a hand cream to be rubbed in, it appears to absorb quickly and you're not left rolling your hands trying to get the lotion to disappear.It's so hard to describe smells. I liked the smell of this, it's lightly fruity. And a test I have with lotions is to rub it on at night and then see if the scent drifts over when I wake up. This lotion passed my sniff test, and I am very picky about perfumed products.",human
"Really like the clippers, strong enough for thicker nails.",human
"They are great when they work, but don't last long. One died after the first few uses. the second one had amazing battery life and I loved it. But after about the 3rd charge, it died faster than it had the first few times and wont take a charge anymore.",human
The very first time I used them the clipping lever came off and it continues to come off.  I would not recommend these clippers.,human
It‚Äôs soft and gently exfoliates dry skin!,human

"12242019 UPDATE: After just 10 minutes of using this gamma brainwave entrainment device, my tinnitus (which I have had for years, but which has never been a bother) was amplified ten fold to the point where it is distressing and headache inducing and has already prevented me from sleeping a night.  The product comes with disclaimers warning against seizures for those who are prone (I am not), but there is no warning about tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and so I feel compelled to issue one here should anyone else be subject to this symptom.  I'm worried enough about it that I've already booked an appointment with a neurologist to get a brain map done in hopes of finding a countervailing frequency that can remedy this awful ringing in my head.  I noticed this effect almost immediately and should have heeded it; should this happen to you, do yourself a favor and discontinue use at once!On top of this, the charging cable has a short in it and the unit cannot be reliably charged, so I am returning it based on this alone.  If only that were my only issue!  Be forewarned.------------------------------Original Review:I suppose this does what it says it will do: it plays an audible tone (maybe 1khz?) pulsing at 40 cycles per second.  It looks like a tiny (one inch square) ipod player, replete with standard headphone jack, usb micro port, and a mini SD card.  For some reason, they include ear buds with the unit; I'd have preferred they saved the money on the buds (which are common enough) and spent a bit more on the quality of the unit.  I'm tempted to see if I can transfer whatever audio file is on the SD card to my phone.  Or just download a binaural brain app that will play the same cycles... but typically, a gamma wave of 40 hz is inaudible.  I'm assuming the 1khz tone cycled 40 times per second matches what was performed in the gamma wave entrainment studies.I plan to use this nightly along with the 40hz lights to see if it has any noticeable affect on my cognitive state.  Time will tell.",human
These are very substantial and hold the shoes on securely. I use them for dancing in heels.,human

This product is nasty and has a very sour taste. Just gross get Lit if you want good pre-work out,human
This Bandage is excellent to use for people with very sensitive skin. The bandages sent to me were not this exact bandage i ordered and I had to send back for a credit.,human
"This is a great concept, it just doesn't deliver like you'd hope. It's not completely useless though. The problem is that the removable tips just don't get hot enough. If it was one solid piece rather than removable silicone tips I think the heat would transfer a lot better. Also, the entire thing is plastic versus metal heating elements on standard heated curlers. The plastic doesn't transmit heat well and doesn't retain it AT ALL. You spend so much time on one eye that it shuts off and gets cold before you can start on the other so you have to start all over and let it heat up again and even that takes way longer than with standard curlers. It's a good thing it's rechargeable too because you might get 3 uses before it has to be charged again, or at least it's that way for me because it has to go through multiple heat ups with each use so maybe someone else would get more uses. If this thing had the heat retention and distribution of a metal heating coil it would be nearly perfect. Adding a battery and temp display would make it 100%. All that said, I have straight, long lashes so I need a tool that is really going to curl. If you already have mildly curled lashes, or at least ones that don't point down (like mine) you might have better luck. It would probably work better on shorter lashes too. I really, really like the design of this curler, I just wish it worked better for me.",human
Love product.took time for feet to get uesd to. But I love these insoles.,human
"In our small second place, which is a condo in the city, and in which the way the water is shared single meter, we have no way to put in a water softener. We have river sourced water in a 100-year-old distribution system, which is among the hardest type of water typical of city water systems. Our washing machine requires 2x  detergent. Calcium deposits kill our faucets, toilet mechanics, and water heaters prematurely. Glass doors of our showers get cloudy. And of course our  dishwasher, without max setting of rinse aid, and unless using specialized hardwater detergent leaves the dishes, and especially glasses and utensils with serious hard water spots.We have been using another quite expensive per pod specialized hardwater dishwasher detergent and it is ok. But this Finish ""Quantum"" works as well, or better, at a lower cost.Give it a try.",human

Losing a little weight now. Thank you very much. Easy to take and does not upset my stomach.,human
I wear petite size small and regular hangers do not fit my shirts. These curved seamless shirt hangers are excellent for my shirts and for sweaters of all sizes. They were worth the wait (shipping time was about 3 weeks). Unfortunately they do not come in white and are rather expensive (probably because they are shipped from Korea).,human
"Quality product but in hindsight an expensive storage solution.  There well-made and durable and in my opinion they‚Äôre ideal for transporting batteries i use them for keeping battery‚Äôs in my pocket etc in the smaller sizes 4 ,6 or even 8. however when it comes to long-term and larger volume storage  there are many less expensive options that are more practical",human
"Although the first arrived with a jammed on button, the replacement worked fine.  The price was considerably less than either almost or in fact identical wands.  As described, it came with an excellent case, safety glasses and a convenient plug in charger.  I would have given it five stars but  because of the first shipment being defective and not at this point knowing its longevity.  Also some of the documentation is wrong concerning the battery, if one should want to get a spare.  But certainly worth buying with the Amazon guarantee.",human
Didn‚Äôt have glucose testing,human
I am not happy with the product for two things: I ordered a medium size and I recived a XL instead and the first two days I sweat a little but on the third day after I washed and I wear it again I did not sweat anymore ... No good at all !!!,human
Love the colors,human
"This product contains not only omega 3, but also omega 6 that most other omega supplement does not offer. My son likes the taste even it smells fishy (of course) to adult but I never try it.",human

"Fabulous, just a great product. I have an eighty year old grandmother who recently hurt her back. My mother and I after much searching decided to give this a try. Perfect fit for both bowl and my grandmother. The handles are the perfect height and don't hinder the seat at all. Very sturdy and so far easy to clean.",human
"Everything seems great... I've never used anything like this before and when I have them in, it doesnt really feel like they're heavy enough? I'm not sure... like I have no problem keeping them in.

"This dvd is really freaking awesome. One scene after the other it just keeps you mesmerized and fixated on the television. Very vividly beauitful and the music is wonderfully relaxing. I'd becareful watching this dvd though - it does relax you completely... so maybe you'd want to do it when you need a break from reality or just want to nod off while watching something on the tele. My friends love it, I love it.. definately 2 thumps up and a booty shake.",human

The stickiness is good and I love the green color.  But the smell is horrible!  It smells like chemicals and I'm hoping this will disappear as I use it. But it makes me wonder what detrimental health effects will come as result - offsetting the benefits of yoga!",human

Has always worked well to protect my face without greasiness or whiteness.,human
Nice item. Works as described.  Nice quality. Smooth texture. Easy to use. Love that it is rechargeable. Have had mine for about a year now prior to making this review and it still works as if it were brand new so excellent quality with a nice lifespan thus far!

However, it is so small that it cut the circulation off in my arm.

"I was diagnosed with neuropathy earlier this year and was told there was NO treatment for it, the symptoms would not improve, and the feeling would never return. One of my symptoms, which I hate more than anything, is the feeling that I have something thick and stiff strapped to my feet. If nothing else, I hoped for improvement for this alone, anything else would be an added benefit.I received these right before I left on vacation, tried them out for a couple of days, three treatments a day, but it was nowhere near enough time. When I returned, I started daily treatments, shooting for three times a day every day, however I have missed weekends a lot and had a few days where I did not get all my treatments in. I have felt the ""thick sensation"" for so long I can barely recall a time when I have not felt it. This morning, I took my dogs out and while walking down the stairs noticed my feet felt different (I do not think this was an overnight, flip the switch, they suddenly felt different, just the first time I noticed). The sensation of a what I guess you could call leather, or to me sometimes it feels like I have plywood in my feet, is changing.I still feel like something is there, but today, for the first time, I noticed it feels lighter, more flexible. Is it a huge difference? No, I would say subtle, but a definite improvement all the same. If this trend continues, I will be overjoyed, if this is best result - it is still enough difference to make my feet feel better and make the treatments worthwhile.I went into this believing I was stuck, and these might help. Are they a miracle? No. Are they helping? Yes. Would I recommend you try them? I would. Am I hopeful for more progress? Certainly am.

"I accept we need to wear masks in public. That's fine, I don't mind. I have some breathing issues (COPD) but I don't run around with fake notes from fake government sites trying to get away with not wearing a mask.These seemed like a good idea for five or ten minutes then someone took a closer look. Other styles of these inserts have clips or hooks molded into them so they can easily be attached to the disposable paper style of mask. These inserts lack any means to hold them in place. You're expected to stuff this under your mask and wish or hope it stays in place. It won't, it's going to slide around while your mask goes another way. If you're lucky it won't pop out and fall to the ground.Breathing while wearing a mask isn't fun. You can do it. Doctor's do it with much more restrictive masks for half a day or longer. but this insert. . . you're literally blocking off 50+% of the surface area inside the mask with plastic that blocks air flow. I sat quietly for five minutes trying this mask out, it became uncomfortably warm inside the mask. I started to sweat. When I tried to talk the insert slid about under my mask. I had to take this off. It was horrible. According to one of the product images in the listing This product will:Realive you from the Bellow Problerms‚Ä¢ Mask Stick to Lipstick - Did not test, probably works.‚Ä¢ Not Breathing Smoothly - This hindered smooth breathing.‚Ä¢ Fogging of Glasses - If anything these worsen how badly glasses fog.‚Ä¢ Sultry Wearing a Mask - This insulates and blocks airflow.

"Even though the reviews were good I was skeptical that it would work. To my surprise it works very well with virtually no side effects. My only problem with this is that it contains DHEA. It has been well documented over the years that this can raise blood pressure. Also there have been many warnings from doctors not to take DHEA regularly. Nevertheless, for occasional use, I suppose it can not do any harm (hopefully). Anyway, to enjoy better sex just take 1 tablet with a glass of water about 45 minutes before sex and it will definitely increase pleasure and hardness of your erection. This is one of the few products of this type that I highly recommend. I'd give it a 5 star for sure if it didn't contain DHEA. If you go to the website WEBMD you can read more about DHEA.

"I use lip balm on a daily basis. I've tried Chapstick, Bath & Body works products, lip butter from The Body Shop, Blistex, Neutrogena, Aquafina lip balm, and Aquaphor ointment. These products all did okay, but what I am really going for is a lip moisturizer, not a ""lip protectant"" with sunscreen. The Aquaphor ointment is good stuff, but a little to heavy for me to use during the day (sometimes I'll leave it on overnight). The Aquafina lip balm I bought in a 4 pack on a whim, but I really liked it and I used every stick to the end. It's very lightweight and not waxy (more like an oil), moisturizing and has a refreshing peppermint smell.After I had used up the Aquafina lip balm, I went to the same store looking for more. They didn't have any, so I started looking at the ingredients of the other products because I remembered that the Aquafina labeled jojoba oil as one of the first ingredients.I found this Green by Nature Lip Butter in a 3 pack, and after reading the ingredients (first 3: beeswax, jojoba oil, shea butter) I bought it. I love this stuff! I think the only reason I like it more than the Aquafina lip balm is because it's slightly thicker (from the shea butter?) and I only have to apply it 2 times in a day, and I've even started applying it before bed! It moisturizes so well that it makes exfoliating a breeze (I exfoliate with a washcloth once a week, after showering, to prevent peely cracked skin).Take note, though, that it does not contain any sunscreen, if that makes a difference to you",human

"This product is too cumbersome to effectively support the wrist. The thumb hole is too small and the fabric is too big. There is not enough strap to isolate the wrist and too much for the hand. It secures as a straight line, and the wrist is loose which is not effective. The other problem is that the material is too slick, so when I try to stand up, there is no support if I use the brace on my wrist, and without the brace my shoulder hurts.The only real as on I gave this a two is because the tourmaline part is stuck on with Velcro and I was able to stick it onto my old brace and use it.

This product is different.  My husband and I thought we would give this a try just to see how it would make things when we make love.  It's ok I guess.  Don't use much because it will affect him as well.  You have to use this a little while before you do anything with your partner.  I was not &#34;loose&#34; before.  This did not really tighten me much.  If you use too much it will affect his size as well.  For best results you will need to rub some inside of you as well as at the vaginal opening.,human

"I would love to give this massager a 5 star review but there is one major reason I did not. More on that in a second.This massager has 1 lone button. Hold it down for a few seconds to turn it on, then tap it to cycle through the speeds. Hold it down again to turn it on. Pretty easy which is good. I mean, who wants complicated when they're in the mood to use one of these? It is powerful, and has a bending head to positioning it is never awkward. The only other thing I can really say is, it got the job done. :)Now for that 1 thing that I had to take a star off for. The battery compartment is not at all user friendly. The cover is difficult to take off and put back on. When there are batteries in it, it's even harder. I feel like they could have designed that aspect of it much better.I received this massager at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.

"I've been using probiotics for years and have appreciated the benefits. This version didn't offer any significantly different benefits in terms of probiotic activity for me, but it does come with one big plus: they taste great!I normally use pills for probiotics since the chews I've tried were not all that appealing in terms of taste. These are much different -- they are round balls about the same size as a typical malted milk ball. It has a waxy coating so it does not melt in your hand. The dark chocolate taste is excellent. It does not have the same texture as actual chocolate (it's a bit more grainy), but it is very tasty.Probiotics are great to keep everything running smoothly in your gut, and this is the best tasting option I've come across. The only downside is that the cost per dose is higher than many of the capsule-based probiotics. Still, it's a great way to encourage probiotic usage since taking one can be considered a treat rather than a chore, and easily earns this 5-stars.",human

My clenching hasn't stopped completely but, the Guard wakes me up if I'm really putting a lot of pressure on my teeth.

I have to say, the warmth feels so nice and soothing.You heat the compress for 20 seconds and then you put it on your eyes for 3-5 minutes once a day.  So, it is very easy to do and it feels great!The warmth is supposed to stimulate the glands in the eyes to release the protective oils that keep the eyes from drying out. As the instructions said I might experience, my vision was a little blurry (due to the oil being released, I guess) for a few minutes after the treatment, but it wasn't too bad and cleared fairly quickly.",human

I have more energy, less irritability and over all just feel better.  I am excited to see how my lab work has improved when I return for the next visit. I highly recommend this if you think or have been tested for adrenal needs. Seems like many moms are taxed in this area, and for good reason, stress, sleepless nights, transition with babies, toddlers, etc.  I don't want to stop taking this unless I have to, the results have been staggering. Highly recommend.UPDATE: This continues to manage my adrenal fatigue and once this was balanced my MD was able to see clearly the functioning of my thyroid which also needed a boost so I am taking this permanently to manage adrenals and other items to take care of thyroid. Can't recommend this enough.",human

Thank you,human
"Raphanus Sativus is a very helpful homeopathic remedy to alleviate a common cause of pain from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), trapped intestinal gas. Gas is one of the major causes of bloating and pain that people with IBS endure. Trapped bowel gas can also develop after surgery. General anesthesia causes the bowels to ‚Äúgo to sleep,‚Äù and the first step in them ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù is to release painfully entrapped gas. Raphanus Sativus can strongly assist the bowels in that recovery.There are other excellent sources of homeopathic remedies besides Boiron, including Hyland's and Dolisos. I tend to choose Hyland's when possible because of their easy-open bottles and quick-dissolve tablets.I have included below some important general information on how to take homeopathic medications for those who might need it.Preparing for Taking HomeopathicsIt is a good idea before using homeopathics to brush your teeth well with baking soda, which has no odor of its own and removes any food odors from the mouth. It is important to avoid mint toothpaste because mint negates the benefits of homeopathics. Do not put anything else, including water, into your mouth for 20 minutes after placing a homeopathic remedy under your tongue. It is also a good idea to avoid food and drink with a strong taste, such as garlic and spicy food, for as long as possible after dosing with a homeopathic remedy, ideally waiting at least an hour.There are two ways to take homeopathics, dry dose and wet dose. Below are instructions for both.Dry doseNote that when taking homeopathic medication, the compounds are volatile, so you should not touch these tablets with your hands. Instead, shake 2-3 tablets into the bottle‚Äôs cap and drop them under your tongue. Be very careful to not touch the cap to your lips or tongue such that saliva gets on the cap, and from there contaminate the remaining pellets in the bottle. Placing the remedy under the tongue allows it to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the thin membrane there. Hold the remedy there for several minutes without swallowing until it completely dissolves.Wet Dose1. Use a clean, dark-glass, 2-ounce dropper bottle or spray bottle.2. Place 3-4 homeopathic tablets in the bottle.3. Add 12 ounce (14 of the glass bottle) of vodka or rum as a preservative. Screw on the cap and shake well until the pellets are dissolved.4. Add 1-14 ounce pure distilled water (that is, fill the bottle about 12 inch from the top). Screw on the cap and shake well, and shake each time before you take a dose.5. A dose is 1 dropperful or, if a spray bottle, one spray. Drop or spray the liquid under the tongue and hold it there for several minutes.",human

"Positives- It worked well in removing contaminates for 1 year.Negatives- There is not enough  threading that attaches the head to the handle, it is very easy to pop off the shower head when turning it for a different massage setting and very difficult to get it back on.It started leaking from the hose connections, and then a few days later the hose detached from the tubing and there is no way of reattaching it! We are handy and it just can't be done.Very disappointing to spend this $$ on a product that lasts only a year! And of course it can't be returned. So now off to try to find a better brand.",human
"I was looking for a nice smelling cream to help with periodic pain in my hand. I didn't want anything that would numb my lips if I accidentally touched my hand to my mouth. This cream is perfect, exactly what I wanted! I massage some in whenever my hand hurts, and it starts feeling better fairly quickly.",human
My body tend to become really dry during summer since I do lots of outdoor activities under the sun. I tried this lotion and it's great. Very moisturizing. Definitely worth the buy!,human
I have bought these before.  They fit just like the other ones did.  They stay on tight and does not loose up.  Great product and great service.,human
It‚Äôs not overwhelming and works,human
"Slim case, great Velcro plenty of room for my curling iron",human
"I'm a diabetic so I can't have sugar. Energy drink has only 70 cal. and no sugar. It is loaded with vitamins and minerals. I add skim.  milk, ripe banana and sweetener, put it in my Magic Bullet. Tastes great and very filling! Great buy at Amazon. Hard to find where I live.",human
Nice,human
Work's great,human
It‚Äôs okay but too pricey,human
I love the size of it bc it is able to fit all of my vitamins etc but the locking feature is difficult to use,human
These are exactly what I was looking for. The description is perfect.,human
"good quality, I think",human
The times are printed backward and the compartments range from ‚Äúimpossible to open‚Äù to ‚Äúdoes not close.‚Äù Honestly the worst organizer I‚Äôve used.,human
The best hair straightener i ever had. Leaves my hair soft and beautiful.,human

Once a year and for inconvenient food illness...amazing results in a two week span. A+,human
I'll keep working on it.  Need something for back pain.,human
Great flavor,human
cheap and see through,human
"Smells good enough, but taking the plastic inner cap off to be able to access the product with a pipette was way too difficult. Broke nails and spilled some trying to get that darn thing off. Won‚Äôt be buying again.",human
Fit perfectly in my momcozy S9 pro,human
I had to go into the Internet to find out how to use this product because the instructions it came with did not help at all.,human
The only result for review is because of bags quality.,human
These came in a timely manner.,human
Bought these cute plates for a picnic.,human
"My whole family loves these immunity bites. My 2 year old daughter says they're so delicious and gets so excited for her daily dose. As a parent, I love that these are made of real fruit, don't have added sugar, are organic, and that I don't have to force my daughter to eat them. Thank you Llama Naturals for another great product :)",human
"Super easy to use, works great. With just one time use I see a big difference. It made my teeth 2 shades whiter with just one time use. Great product.",human
What arrived was not what is illustrated. Also the material and construction is cheap. Total deception and it was immediately returned for a refund. I only gave it one star for that is the lowest rating I can give it here.,human
Good product for a great price. Fits my electric toothbrush perfectly.,human
Great product.  Used for years and glad Amazon seller had in stock as local stores were out.  Will buy online from no on.,human
Very thin bags. They can tear if not pulled right from the roll.,human
Very handy. Four stars because it is expensive.  I'd give it six for utility. Keeps the drawers tidy and enables keeping track of how many are where.  This would make a great promotion for a battery company. We have some for most all the sizes and I can't make sense of the pricing algorithms other than to say all are priced way more than intrinsic value would suggest. But as far as disposable income goes we have burned through a lot more elsewhere and gotten way less use.  When these get loss leadered or misprinted I will stock up big time.,human
Love these brushes for my electric tooth brush,human
For the arches on my feet when I where high heels,human
"By far the best toothpicks out there. I‚Äôve been using them to not chew tobacco. The best I can tell they are made in the USA, my only complaint is that some of them don‚Äôt hold up and break easily.Overall a solid investment",human
Best products and smells good,human
This is the best Wintergreen alcohol I have come across.  This is very authentic and you can definitely smell the mint. It took a little while to receive because it came from Jamaica but it was worth the wait.  I had a minor issue but the seller responded quickly and resolved my issue.  I do recommend this product to anyone who wants an authentic product that works.  This is much better than what's sold in the US.,human
"I‚Äôve bought Rise multiple times and it‚Äôs a phenomenal product. Tastes great but more importantly, it works. The coconut powder and salts are a great added benefit to an amino product. Always feel better after drinking it",human
"My nails are so soft I can bend them right over the tip of my finger and they grow very slowly. I read biotin can help and these are a high dose, which is why I picked them. Thicker hair would be a bonus. I've been taking them for 6 weeks.So far there's zero improvement in my nails. And my hair has been falling out. That could be a side effect of anesthesia from two eye surgeries in two weeks, and it has finally slowed. There's new hair growth, so we'll see. I'll give it until the bottles run out.FYI, this stuff stinks. Like grass clippings, but not fresh, like they got left in the garage for a month. It helps some to leave the cap off.",human
Very helpful in giving me genealogy leads and identifying various people with my same last name who may well be my ancestors.,human
"nice, really cute print.",human
This came faster than expected and the bamboo is nice and sturdy. I like the Japanese practice of starting the day with warming up the feet on these and thus the whole body; however I did not think the reflexology nubs were necessary. I have a fairly small foot and the width of this bamboo was already too wide so adding extra bumps actually didn't accommodate my foot well. I will order a plain bamboo item next time and suggest a  more precise instruments to focus on reflexology separately.,human
The best deodorant ever! I'll need to buy more !!!,human
So far we love these toothbrushes. Good value for the price. And we really like the various settings. Our favorite is the two minute timer that pauses a quick moment every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch to another quadrant of your mouth. Very cool!,human
This is a UV-C for heating and air conditioning. It is installed in the area where the ductwork goes before it gets into your home. I have been using the smaller UV portable units but I have to be careful to not run it with the animals around or humans. This will prevent me having to do the getting everyone out of the house for a while and running the other ones.,human
"Great call, buck come running",human
"I like toothpaste, it what I was expected !Shipping not so long time",human

Great for the money,human
"They look better in the photo. Very bland, very cheap looking. Had to add my own nail polish to spice them up. But couldn't go a day without them popping off. Going to try a different nail glue. But won't buy again.",human
We have been using kinesiology tape for many years.  Most of the tapes are much more expensive and their small size means we end up wasting some at the end of the roll.  The quality of this tape and the fact that it is in a large roll make it the perfect tape for our use.  We highly recommend it.,human
Package arrived ahead of time.  Well packaged but easy to open.  (A plus in my book) Life Extension  Zinc tabs are a daily addition to my vitamin regime.,human
I have gotten other pillows like this and this one is firmer than most. It does a good job at keeping your knees separated while sleeping. I also use these types of pillows on the couch to keep my neck in a comfortable position. Most of the other pillows are on the squishy side used as a pillow and this one is quite firm.,human
It was in excellant condition alot better than I expected. Was everything I thought it would be. i have ordered a second one already,human
Premium Amazing lights sooo bright,human
Decent back packing kit. Has all essentials needed if problem arrives. Comes in very good portable case that makes transport easy.,human

"Great, light, slightly tinted. I'm going to run out of this quickly!",human
"The product already had the protective seal peeled back, and it looks like a portion of it was missing.",human
First day using it literally the 1st time blowing it up it had a hole in the top and  went down . The base was filled with ice and drinks not moved at all and it just went flat over time too . Waste of money . No refund given because I didn‚Äôt bother sending it back since it was wet and flat not worth the hassle .,human
My kids did not like it,human
"Great Product, Perfect Seller A+",human
Its trash the handle is the only part that vibrates so its a regular toothbrush with a vibrating handle.,human
The tablets did not give off much of anyscent at all in the shower. Will not buy again,human
I was looking for a super glue type cut closer. This stuff hardens very slow. And it washes off in the shower. waste of money,human
"Item came promptly & packaged well. It looks even better in person & has great volume. I seen all the negative reviews for this which aren't all correct. The waves sounds just like white noise to me. Sadly it needs to be plugged into a power source to function but for the $4.99 I paid, I can't complain.",human
"Must be working. No longer have to get up multiple times to use the bathroom during my sleep time.As with all there products I love the bottles, Not an embarrassment. Can display with ease.I purchased this for free or a discounted price to use, and to give my unbiased opinion.",human
Works nicely but only for 30 minutes...,human
Works great,human
These were all very sturdy and pretty. I was happy with them. Worked great for the baby shower!,human

"B vitamins are needed when you are on a vegetarian diet or when you are just stressed out by life's challenges. These easy-to-use tubes are portable and travel well. They save you from having to swallow more pills. These are pleasantly strawberry flavored and provide B3, B6, B7, B9 and B12. The other ingredients include distilled water, vegetable glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate and natural flavorings. They taste great. To your health...please consult with a doctor before taking supplements. Personally these make me feel calmer and less anxious.~The Rebecca Review",human
"These are ... OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I like the leather, but that's about all that distinguishes these from other similar products, and frankly, I like some of the other Dr. Scholl's insoles much better in terms of comfort.I tried them in two different pairs of shoes.  Yes, the bottom of the insole is &#34;sticky,&#34; but it's more &#34;tacky&#34; than &#34;sticky,&#34; and I think the purpose is to keep the insole from shifting position.  I had no trouble moving them from one pair to the other.  I first tried them on an older pair of high-end flats that are almost past their expiration date.  Noticed a little more &#34;squishy&#34; feeling, but other than that, nothing.  Moved them to an el cheapo pair of flats with almost no cushioning in the soles.  Again, a slight feeling of &#34;squishiness,&#34; but nothing that I'd say was praise-worthy.For me, then, they're OK.  Nothing great, nothing really wrong with them.  They just didn't make enough of a difference for me to recommend them enthusiastically.  3 stars ...",human
It worked great,human
"I like this vegan omega 3 because I don‚Äôt get any after taste. Not the easiest to swallow, but I don‚Äôt care as long as don‚Äôt get algae flavor after!",human

Great Santa hat. Wore it for company holiday party and received many compliments!,human
I was concerned that the black quilted material may look a bit feminine as I had purchased two of these for Christmas gifts for men. My husband said they were fine. Perhaps it was the sleeve it was packaged in which is pinkish and lavender. That being said it's a nice kit with all the essential tools and would work for either a male or female.,human
"Supplements were a great deal, cheaper than the local nutrition store.  Plan to order again in the future.  No complaints at all but just so everyone knows, Amino Acids taste TERRIBLE!  They also give you terrible breathe while you're eatingdrinking it.  Just a heads up, I wasn't aware of this until after I started them.",human
Ok,human
Have to be up late studying on the computer and these have made sleeping afterwards a LOT easier!,human
I'm kind of between a 6 and a 6 12 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose.  These pads help with the 6 12 for the ones that are a little loose. Adds a bit more comfort for long wear.,human

"My poor girl dog has a yeast infection affecting her vulva and surrounding tissues. These worked immediately to soothe and cleanse the area.

I‚Äôve been fighting with my daughter trying to get her to take other brands. There is no way to cover up the iron smell and flavor of iron. She seams not to fight as much when we started with this brand.,human
"A great product, not too easy to open for older people",human
Works great as instructed.  Heating &#60;2 minutes and lasts 20-30 minutes.  Very gentle gradual heat release.  Size is just right for all body locations.  Great for period cramps back pain and other. Great packaging and fast shipping.  Recommend.  Thanks!,human
"It's an effective moisture barrier for at night, but I don't think it does anything but seal in moisture because I know that collagen is too big of a molecule to pass through the skin's barrier. Still super cute and great for dry skin that needs help helping itself. If your skin is so dry that it's flaking off, sleep with this on and it won't be when you wake up. However, don't put it too close to your eyes because they will water a bit.",human
"I really like this unit, so far. Just got it, set it up and tried it out. The low price kinda scared me but figured I've thrown enough of these little trimmer away at least I won't have a big investment. Unit seems fairly solid built. Love the little stand everything fits in. Remember the instructions suggest NO rechargeable battery. Tried the nose clipper and the eyebrow trimmer attachment. Both worked really well. A little nervous about taking it in the shower but if I run into a problem I'll update the review. So far so good.",human
"These things are great. My daughter loves yogurt and this adds some texture, extra flavor and extra protein to her diet. She says they're tasty enough to eat alone.",human

For the price, there are many good alternatives.",human

Still not working. i called the store and they told me to hold the brake levers in for about 30 seconds, Everything went to working then. The store gets a 5.

I use it in the shower and like it a lot.  My husband is letting me use it for awhile to see if it holds up.  If it does he will get his own.  ****Update**  I purchased another and both died before a year.  Just stopped working without any warning at all.  When it worked they worked great but they die early.  Disappointed,human

"This shaver is good but not great. Due to some medical issues, my husband needs a razor that is very simple to operate and charge.  This one is good for that.  However, it feels pretty flimsy.  The plastic cover will not snap on and stay on.  When I remove the head to clean the inside, it‚Äôs hard to get it back on correctly.  But overall, for the price, this is a pretty good razor, gets a reasonably close shave, is easy enough to clean, and holds it‚Äôs charge for a good long time.  I am pretty happy with it for my husband.I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you!",human
Not worth it.. Good old water bottle works just as fine and way better.,human

These don‚Äôt feel like they are wrapped quite as tightly as my old set, but I fully expect them to last over a year. They don‚Äôt leave any fuzz behind on my clothes and they don‚Äôt have any weird chemicals. This is a very affordable option to substitute for dryer sheets.",human
These are cute and there are a lot of them!  Sturdy and a nice variety. Pay close attention to the size.  There is a photo that looks like girls are holding the signs ... they aren't... signs are not that big.,human

"I developed an eczema on my eye lids as a result of sun exposure.  My usual eye creams do not work for me anymore as they irritate my extremely sensitive skin and cause new flare-ups.  While I found a few eye products that do not sting or cause more irritation, I am constantly searching for more and kind of obsessed right now to get more relief from itching and redness.  So among other eye products I ordered Body Tonique Repair and Replenish Facial and Body Oil.  It arrived promptly in a sealed 4 ounce plastic bottle.  The twist on and off lid is convenient for precise dispensing.  The oil is a mixture of several carrier oils with mostly oils that are found in the kitchen.  It also has a blend of essential oils that is kept a secret by manufacturer.  I was able to recognize lemon and lavender oils in it.  I applied this oil under my eyes only where I have eczema.  It was absorbed some but left a very noticeable greasy residue.  It felt okay on the lower lids but the oil got on my eye lashes and into my eyes and caused some eye irritation and blurred vision.  It made me blink constantly.  I should put less oil and even lower next time to prevent this from happening.  I already used jojoba, argan, moringa seed, rose hip and sea buckthorn oils and found them to work better and not leave so much greasy residue on my lids.  It is probably better to use it on the body than on the face, and definitely away from the eyes.  However, the biggest issue I have with the price.  While I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I think the regular price is extremely high for what it is and I will not repurchase this product in the future.",human

I am always on the lookout for some good mangesium powders.  I use them at night before I go to sleep.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a glass jar and is well packed.FULL?The jar in the photo was taken after I only took two scoops of product.  The fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is.  It really should be a bit fuller than it was.EASY TO TAKE?This is not difficult to take.  It is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink it.FLAVOR?I did not find the flavor offensive.  Some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag.  This one was not like that for me at all.  It is actually pleasant to take uncluttered with sweetners.DOES IT HELPThis is really helpful to relax me at night.THE BOTTOM LINEThis powder is pleasant to take.  It is not cluttered with stevia or other additives.MY RATINGFIVE STARS. I am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added.  I only wish it was a little fuller.,human
Perfect for our rotary toothbrush. Tastes great and gentle on the enamel.,human
"For Christmas, I bought nine grandchildren a [[ASIN:B0007UO4V4 Big Tex Pistol]]. It's cast metal, realistic toy revolver. It appears sturdy, but it breaks like a shotgun, and if a kid ""breaks"" it a lot, it eventually won't stay fastened. Since I didn't want to spend upwards of $50 or $60 on replica guns for preteen kids, I found this gun to be an excellent step up. It is heavy plastic with a revolving cylinder. It is single action and will only fire if the hammer is cocked. My 3-year-old grandsons can accomplish this. The gun I received has a handle that looks like a modern .357 or .44 revolver - not like the handle pictured. Although the gun looks modern, it has a thumb release door to allow one cylinder bore at a time for loading - like an old single action cowboy gun. I bought [[ASIN:B004CWFV42 BlackHawk Hip Hip Holster Right Hand Black 5 3 5 Barrel SA Revolver Nylon 73NH12BK-R]] to go with it. My 3-year-old and 4-year-old grandson love this gun.

"$40 for 160-sheets of &#34;waste&#34; paper. Before you order this, just think for a minute...Everytime you go to grab 1-sheet to wipe-up some mess or to dry your hands, it's going to cost you a quarter. If it's a big mess and 'God forbid' you need to use 4-sheets, that's a buck. My question is: Is it worth it? Is it worth the expense of &#34;temporarily&#34; having a colored towel on the counter, only to end up in your &#34;waste&#34; can? I don't think so...To me, that's just a &#34;waste&#34;. But, then again...I'm not a &#34;wasteful&#34; or wealthy person.",human

"Being gifted with very straight, blonde lashes, I've found it necessary to curl them so they show up at all.  I've used the regular CG curler, various super-cheap brands, and also the Shu Uemura one that is generally accepted as the greatest thing to ever happen to eyelashes.  (Don't get me wrong, it really is good.)  But this one is better.  I loooooove this eyelash curler for it's ease of use, long-lasting curl, softness and best of all, NO EYELID PINCHING.  Highly recommended.",human

I absolutely love these masks. The design and colors are attractive to me. The material is thick and layered and they are comfortable to wear. These are perfect for the fall or the winter. They are made of 100% cotton and the current price of $14.99 for these two masks are a reasonable price at $7.50 each.,human
"The product itself is excellent and works very well on heavily stained items, whether alone or with an additive like extra oxyclean, laundry sterilizer, etc... the container though, has a problem with oozing soap around the cup holder, and bends a bit too easily when held anywhere except the handle.",human
"One of them came with a little whole. So it was starting to spread. Besides that everything was perfect, it was delivered on time.",human
"The Herbon lozenges are by far the best my family has ever used. I won't name brands, but we have tried them all.  Many are nasty tasting or are little more than candy wearing a mask.These lozenges soothe even the most raging sore throat and itch.  You know, the one when you are on day three and you think you coughed up at the very least 75% of your lungs. They calm that dry hitching feeling as well.My family adores these and I keep them on hand year round. They are excellent when you travel.  Airports and airplanes, and cars too, are often dry.I wish my coop still carried them, but now I buy them over the internet. I usually buy a case so we always have been.",human
"Good ingredients, but hard to stay put on the gum... ends up just a sawdust mouth experience where you have to spit it all out and rinse ... hmm... wish they made this in a gel form or paste or something other than powdered herbs...",human
Did not read label before buying but doctor recommended it.  I do not know why because she knows I have PMR which is an automimune disease.  I feel like I want her to reimburse me.  I read on the label not to be used by someone with AI disease.,human

Anyone camping or traveling should carry this in their pack. It is a life saver when no soap is available and great when the only soap available has perfume that gives you a headache. This is head ache free as far as I can tell.,human
Amazing soap in every way. If it were a little cheaper it would be in every bathroom in the house.,human
Too short,human
"I used these for a craft project. Some of them came split and broken. (It wasn't a big deal for me since I wasn't using them for liquids). However, if you are planning on drinking out of these, just be prepared for 20% of them to be split in someway or another.",human

Would love to leave a 5 star but sadly I tried this airbrush kit with my Mac airbrush make up and it would not work with it was so ever . However it‚Äôs great for rose water I‚Äôll be using mine for skin care but I‚Äôm going to try different brands for airbrush foundation . Also missing the big clear container I got the metal and the smaller clear container . Note shows not verified buyer due to the fact my husband bought it for me for Christmas and I‚Äôm using my own account to review it . 1010 recommend but just know not all airbrush make up will work with this machine . It‚Äôs also very cute obsessed with how cute it is ü•∫üòç,human

"EASY TO USE, DOES THE JOB.",human
"I don't know what I expected from these, but it was something more delicious than what I got. Let's be real: these are seaweed granules. And that's just what they taste like. I mix them into my daily bone broth, but they generally sink to the bottom right away. So the last bit of broth is always full of gritty granules that taste like the ocean floor. Not great, but hopefully they're at least good for me.",human
No problem noted,human
"The case leaves lots to be desired but the actual sounds are solid, sturdy, and easy to sanitize.",human
I really think these help with wrinkles and drying time. They're cute too!,human
"These are THE BEST. They are vegan friendly, have three of the best immune boosting ingredients (elderberry + zinc and vitamin C) and my kids actually enjoy them! They taste really good- I have taken them myself and I only wish my vitamins tasted this good. Much easier to give daily vs the syrups and I love that I can just hand them to my kids and thats it. They take them without issue. Great price as well and I like that the packaging is less wasteful (still think that could be worked on, but to keep costs low I understand this packaging.)",human

My local pharmacy stopped carrying an equivalent to these flavored 500 mg vitamin C tablets. Some flavored C's are like chewing chalk and some are flavored but are still bitter. These tropical fruit flavored vitamin C's are easy to chew and swallow. Glad I found a source.,human

This product was recommended by a friend who had major heart surgery.  My husband had been on a blood thinner and bruised easily - he is no longer bruising.  Articles recommend magnesium for every over 60.  We are so glad we are taking chelated magnesium!,human
I am very disappointed with this product.  I really thought it would help me be able to use my phone independently but it does not.  I have two major complaints about it.  First this product only works if you have enough movement in your wrist to turn your hand all the way around until your palm is facing upwards.  I only have enough movement in my wrist to do with halfway and unfortunately I cannot fit my hand around it.  This makes it impossible for me to use it the way it was intended.  The second problem I have with it is the Velcro strap slides up and down my phone too easily. It is hard to keep the device in place. The bottom line if you have limited wrist movement I would not recommend this product.,human
The vitamin D tablet that I was taking was like a horse pill. It was huge and not coated. Very hard to get down. This tiny gel type pill is a wonder! It is so small and coated. Very easy to swallow. No after taste.These I look forward to taking!,human

The material is very sturdy at the same time it feels very good when you walk on these.Customer service is great. I had an issue and they resolved it immediately.I also feel a big difference in my back. I had a Spinal Cord tumor surgery and ultimately had a spinal cord damage so after walking and standing even for a bit, my feet‚Äôs over pronation really affects my knees.These insoles made a big difference in my overall ability to stand and walk for a bit longer now.",human

Keep the heat on low.  The picture is 5 days after I used the product for the first time.  I didn't know what it was supposed to feel like so the pain I attributed to the good suction power and not my skin being burnt. I did have the heat on the 3rd setting.  I still wouldn't expect a burn like this.,human

"I‚Äôve used about 4 kinds of these extenders. One was flimsy and contorted under hot water. One was short and made everything extremely tight. Another had smaller prongs which made it difficult to impossible to use it with masks with thicker earloops.  This one is a nice material and I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs ripping my hair when I take it off, it holds earloops of thin and thick mask and has well placed adjustment points.",human

I have not used this specific for me.  I used the Peaceful sleep for Everyone Cd and still do when I M tired and can't sleep.  I specifically like theist hypnotic suggestion that you can use when you wake up in the night. It helped even when I thought I was 100% awake.Because I loved that cd I had no problem recommending this one to a pregnant women.  She had never had problems with sleep before but was sleeping half of the night.  She used it successful through the rest of the pregnancy and described it as a God send.,human

"Taste like mint toothpaste, but does not whiten teeth.",human
"Overall, this is an okay toothpaste. Not the best. Not the worst, and overpriced for what it claims (and fails) to do. I've been using it for several weeks and haven't noticed any significant improvement in my oral health, tartar levels, or whiteness. It's minty and on the thinner side. It's not meant to foam, but I feel I need more than average amounts to properly brush my teeth. My teeth feel clean, but not moreso than they do with other toothpastes. I'll stick with the Periogen mouth rinse.",human
21320  I had concerns about the shape of the head being effective. My concerns were not valid. The trimmer works with no issues and is quieter than my old AA battery unit.

There were complaints that it wouldn't take a charge but I can't comment on that at this point.  I will revisit this review when I have more information.,human

First of all these come in a thin black plastic bag inside a plastic mailer. There are no instructions included. After doing some research I found they need to be renewed approximately once a month in sunlight for 2 hours. So first I placed one in each room. Not that I had any glaring odors. I did have a bag of yarn that I was given that has the person's perfume scent on it that gives me asthma. Put the largest bag in with the open bag. No change. Going to put the whole set in with it and see if it helps but not holding my breath. The two with buttons and attached loops are my favorites. Updated: they totally worked in the yarn bag. I can now use the yarn.Be careful if you cut open the bag. I cut both bags.,human

With all of the others, even if I kind of liked it at first, after a few months I could not even stand the smell of it anymore let alone drinking it a couple times a day.

The packets are really convenient to shove into a purse or backpack or something with a blender cup full of cold water and ice for on-the-go.",human

"I bought this for my great niece for the next time she stays overnight with me.  We haven't opened this yet, but looks like it was described.",human
"There is no material to block light at the nose bridge. So, if you have no or a very small nose bridge, this mask will block most or all of the light and is very soft.  If you have a larger nose bridge, light will leak through.Loops behind the ear hold the mask in place.  Whether you find that comfortable or not is personal preference, especially compared to the behind the head style bands.",human
was not impressed with using this. Wasn't able to scrub things and have it remove the food.,human
"Oh. My. Gosh!! I absolutely love these oil‚Äôs!! My favorite is this Orange oil, when I use it it smells like orange zest all in my house! &lt;3 I‚Äôve used all of these oil‚Äôs in the little time that I‚Äôve had them. The Peppermint would be my 2nd favorite oil. Awesome product!!",human
"I change my brush heads all the time.  If we get sick, I immediately toss out the old brush heads and put new ones on once we're over the illness.Otherwise I change out our brush heads every other month.  So, it can get expensive.Great deal with these brush heads.  They fit the Oral B perfectly.  They aren't too hard or too soft.I like that I'm able to find cheaper brush heads that are compatible with the Oral B.",human
Great product. Great price. Only partial bottle.,human
"[[VIDEOID:1d893bb2ba9130c4d500e23882dcee42]] i‚Äôve went through about 4 foot spa machines and this by far is the best and i will surely keep. it is big. enough space for my husband who is a size 11 and he says he still has a lot of room. second, i love the remote control AND drain. something i‚Äôve not really considered and am glad i got this. honestly, i got this on a whim. thinking i‚Äôd just return it if I end up not liking it. did not read that it had a remote lol. as you see in the video it works so hooray! the drain is kinda slow BUT dont let that stop you. if spillage is your concern, this drains slowly and no spills. third, the heater works!! unlike some that only retain the heat, this one really heats up the water for you. I know because i put cold tap water and heated it to 40. fourth‚Ä¶ i loooove the rollers at the bottom. this made filling up and then moving it near the couch so easy. NO carrying for me, less mess, less spillage. fifth, the cover and the tools that came with it. they are useful bonuses. if you are like me who like to keep things dust free, the cover is something that you will surely appreciate. and of course the tools.. at first i didnt use them but they helped to get the smaller areas of my husband‚Äôs feet. i dont know how to use all of them but im sure they will all play a role someday lol. overall, recommend. steep price BUT it isn‚Äôt your regular foot spa. it is worth it i promise!",human
"What you see in the picture is not what you get it's actually much smaller as if it was made for my six-year-old child pretty much what you're getting is so velcro straps to wrap your shoulders in very very short no support and it actually comes half the distance down your back as the one shown exclamation point was excited to find one at such a bargain price, yet I guess it's as they say you get what you pay for very displeased once again pictures and descriptions mislead the consumers once again",human

"I bought this on a whim.  I have been to the ENT and she advised me should would not ablate the crypts causing the tonsil stones.  She suggested a waterpik with some special tip.  I have a waterpik but this doesn't work that well to get the stones removed.  The Tonsil Stone Removal Tool with LED is really a blessing.  If you have tonsil stones that drive you nuts, this is the tool for you!",human
Works great,human
I bought 2 pairs. I loved them at first. First pair broke fairly quick. I chalked it up as o well. Ordered a 2nd pair. Yup they broke. Should have purchased a more expensive brand.,human
This one doesn't have the zapping power that my other one had but it is useable should have ordered the higher priced one,human
Good product -- always has been. I always keep some in my vehicle. My local stores don't carry it anymore.,human
The worst..,human
"I have very oily skin, and had to wash my cushion daily and change it monthly or it wouldn't seal. I thought I would try these to see if they would help. So far they are working well, there is a bit of air leakage and I have to have the straps tighter, but there is none of the annoying noise associated with the leakage. I also haven't had the skin irritation I sometimes get with the silicone cushions. They seem like a less expensive alternative to changing my expensive cushions. My only criticism is that they are not custom made to a particular mask, and that the opening must be hand cut. It would be nice if they would custom make them to fit the popular masks.",human
"Very nice box of bath bombs. They smell so beautiful, and work well in your bathtub. They do not leave your skin dry at all. My daughter really likes them.",human
"This thing is great! Once you figure out proper placement, it offers great pelvic stability and a great glutethigh workout!! Someone should teach a class, the men would be jealous!! I'm ordering another one. Easy to clean, I take it in the shower with me. A must have, like any good foundation garment. Wear it under your dress!!",human
"This works great. it's gentle and a slower process, but doesn't seem to ""wear out"" like the sand-paper types you buy.  It really smoothed out some very rough skin I had!",human
It's good for the first two uses but it loses its scrub,human
They are thin in the front & really thick on the sides & back. It would have been okay if they were actually comfortable. Didn‚Äôt fit it my shoe sides are too big.,human
These colorful water proof ear plugs are great to use. They protect my ear that has an ear tube to be able to shower or swim. I love swimming in summer and these allow me to do this. I highly recommend this product.,human
"item as described, great for fitting into children's pocketed cloth masks. My daughters favorite is jojo siwa masks from target, they are breathable, easy on her skin and fit well, but they are alittle thin and this gives a nice layer of protection since she's not eligible for vaccination yet",human
I like that the silicone back scrubber and body scrubber do not hold any bacteria and are easier to rinse out than the net ones. They lather well and feel nice with a gentle stimulating sensation. I do wish the head of the back scrubber was a little larger but it does works well.,human
Awesome buy!!! Will buy more when I ran out,human
Can be used normally,human
Wonderful amount and quality of crystals.,human
I am giving this hat 4 stars because the draw string doesn't make it fit proper.  Other than that I love it,human
I cut them smaller and they truly clean and can be used as often as I need them. I only wash them and leave them to dry on a chair. Great buy.,human
Works great!!!  Highly recommend!!!!,human
No need to spend more on other brushes these will do the job. Bristles last and their design avoids scratches. Only four stars cause I‚Äôve only used for a couple months.,human
this is just okay!,human

"I don't love holding heavy weights that are being supported by my shoulders and full arms (and recruiting additional muscles beyond the forearms as well).  So I decided to add a bar and bearings and other stuff to make it a fixed forearm roller.  That was great but MADRE DI DIO!!!!  It added like a hundred buckaroos to the final cost... :)That all said, it works great as a McGyvered fixed forearm roller and I am glad I bought it (and all the other accoutrements...).",human
Just what I was hoping for,human
My daughter loved it!,human
"I bought these for my business. As a pure romance consultant I use this for my sample goody bags that I give out. It includes a couple samples, my business card and a couple pieces of candy!

Hubs and I have been taking a blend of mushroom powder everyday for months and I think it has really helped with our immune system. When this mushroom supplement came up on my list of items I could review I instantly selected it. I like the variety of mushrooms included in this mushroom supplement and am always glad to see Chaga mushroom included.  I buy Chaga separately as a powder because it is so incredibly good for the immune system. All of these mushrooms in this supplement are extremely good for health and there is nothing I can find negative to say about it.,human
Did not like the shape of this balloon.  It looked like a giant penis and did not use it.,human

"Now, these are awesome sponges. I had to replace a sponge I had for a while and these have been awesome. I love the two different sides because you have the normal washing sponge part but then the top side is a rough exfoliating side and it works great for those rough areas and getting off all the dead skin that's built up from the winter. I am loving these and they are making my skin feel amazing.",human

NO2 supplements with all the added ingredients are a definite boost. This formulation includes some primo ingredients. Quite happy with the assay.Better than advertised. Tastes fine.,human
It works the way it's supposed to..My only problem is that there too thick to put up under jeans for  women and a little tight not much  Tolerable A for small duration of time may be 3 to 4 hours. I'd  buy again,human
"It works. Just not on demand. It take a little bit to turn on. Sometimes you have to get off and get back on for it to work. I weight 170 and I heard some cracking noise when I first used it but it didn't break. My wife is fatter than I am, I'm afraid if she uses it, it will break.",human
My hair gets wet:( not happy with this cap.,human
It was smaller than I expected and the clear panel on one side reveals the contents.,human
"Great product from a truly exceptional company! So transparent about where the ingredients come from (their family farm in Kansas USA) and how they are grown! I haven‚Äôt found that with very many other companies that produce this type of product! It tastes great and I take it in the morning on an empty stomach. I don‚Äôt have my coffee for like half hour after. It tastes great (even if it didn‚Äôt I would still use it for the health benefits)!  It keeps me super regular, in a non-harsh way, not like laxatives but like I‚Äôm giving my body what it needs to gently stay regular. I love this product and I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to live  a healthier life. I used to have IBS and get horrible trapped gas and was usually in pain with digestive issues and believe me when I say I rarely now have episodes like that since I started using this product. It is truly remarkable and I believe it‚Äôs because of the quality and care that goes into making this Detox & Digest product, and all the Amazing Grass products as I have tried several and they are all a healthy addition to any diet. Well worth the money as you are investing in your health and I cannot think of a better way to spend my money. Our health is so important...just think of times when you were sick and miserable and how good it feels to be healthy!  I am buying more today, and just wanted to post this review to help others!",human
"I like the idea and it really does help but it is really rough and painful on my delicate underarm area. Also, water gets stuck inside the brush every time I use it in the shower and doesn‚Äôt come out on its own so that‚Äôs a little inconvenient for me.",human
"After a month the battery stop charging, waste of money!",human
"Nowhere in the description does it say you only get one mask. Looking at the pictures, you would think it came with four. But it's only one. You can buy a multi pack of really nice, silky, adjustable masks for the same money.This mask is made out of fleece that will pill and get less soft with time. It also has ear loops instead of a strap behind your head. I can't imagine that will be comfortable, and it definitely won't fit everyone. It's too tight on me (an adult woman) and too loose on my 9-year-old son (who it was intended for).",human
"I like the version of the product that is a keychain with the separate cord that attaches to the activation pin. I got 3 of those. The 4th one is a different model, and it appears the key ring is the activation pin. I don‚Äôt like that I got two different styles.",human
"If you can keep them in your ears, they work well, but if you have any ear wax or moisture, coating your ear canal, they tend to expand and slide out. I found it hard to keep them in. I have better results with the 3M ear plugs.",human

A well being feel good supplement.,human
Sexy for the moment.. But we only used this thing once or twice at most.. Kind of cheap.. but thats what we paid for!,human
"These gloves are okay for thickness and durability, I have had better and worse.  The main problem is they are not size small as printed on the site or the box. They are huge, more like a medium or large.  I'm disappointed because I wear gloves a lot, and having the right size really reduces hand fatigue and increases precision and dexterity. I will not order these again.",human
"It fits the face cleansing brush, but the movable part is too snug and doesn't allow vibration. Not an adequate replacement brush head.",human
"Am using in lieu of harmful big Pharma products. I actually have had some success getting off big Pharma poisons with Bach flower remedies!!!  I‚Äôve also found them helpful in withdrawals from various big Pharma drugs! Gotta love that.I don‚Äôt care for the alcohol in these products, just started using them and some of them seem to help.  Not sure but think the alcohol might be causing minor headaches and upset stomach when are using straight from the bottle as suggested. Better 2 put into water.Amazon does have some of these without alcohol, so please check especially if they have worked for you.  BEWARE:  apparently Amazon does not stock these regularly in the warehouses, so the deliveries are very very late even if you are a prime member.Also beware of third-party sellers who use USPS, since it could sit in your mailbox for several days if you‚Äôre not OCD about your mail, which I am not. Ergo, one seller sent during sub freezing temperatures and bottles were broken. Strangely I received the refund and ‚ÄúSomebody‚Äù sent new bottles within 48 hour?????  Not sure exactly how that works when it took so long to get here in the first place???This is energy medicine and is more subtle than some remedies. I highly suggest the encyclopedia of Bach flower therapy by MECHTHILD SCHEFFER as a research source on Amazon used.  Very thorough book with pictures of the plants and definitely a plus if you find success with the BACH Flower essences.  You will love this book and the way it‚Äôs written and laid out. And you‚Äôll definitely need to study up on how to heal thyself, and she gives you lots of options. So many that sometimes it‚Äôs overwhelming. But there‚Äôs a flower essence for that!!Wishing you the best of health and connection to the planet& all beings in a brand new way your spirit will relish along with flower essence.  U R worth it.  Definitely definitely recommend trying several different specifically BACH remedies still created in the UK with original recipes and plantstreesbushes.",human
great for use .  we are decorating with them.,human
"If you have to wear a mask, these are the ones I liked best!",human
surprisingly well made and sturdy--avail strengths were hard to find elsewhere,human

I thought this would be perfect to scrub my back in the shower.  It is useful but hard to soap up.  Kind o heavy to use. It does work okay but I‚Äôm not totally in love with this scrubby. I read the reviews & I thought this would be perfect but it‚Äôs just okay in my option.,human
"I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water, but not too long ago, I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two, then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet, just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener, and the dropper has measuring lines on it.HOW TO USE THIS?I was so run down when I got thinking about it, I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having ""the runs"".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.By the end of the morning, I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.THE BOTTOM LINEThis is not hard to take, has just a bit of raspberry flavor, but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with ""the runs""  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.MY RATINGFOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.  I also experienced good from it so far, so I am leaving it at FOUR STARS, but REALLY IT IS FOUR AND A HALF.",human
It does the job and my eyelashes don't get stuck in it like they did with my old school curler.  I'm wondering how I clean the mascara out that inevitably accumulates around the heating element though?,human
This foam padding makes the mask more comfortable and helps the mask stay in place better.  I put the foam adhesive pad over a piece of aluminum.  then stitch a small piece of fabric over them to secure them in place.  I also think it helps decrease my glasses fogging.,human
"And i'm not heavy...Just used it on a daily basis to monitor our weight.  Liked it, but in the end it turned out to be a very expensive product.",human
I absoultely love it!!! As described and its definitely a $40 well spent :-),human
"Buena compra, cumpli√≥ su objetivo",human
Just wish it was a little bigger. But is good quality. Holds what I need for the day.,human

"Super cute but after blowing air in it the hard way I noticed some of the balloons were pretty dirty. Like brown stuff on them, I instantly mouth washed....",human
Does not work for cleaning,human
"Although natural and very pretty, some had holes in the middle, not a big deal as it still keeps the glass of the table.  The clear rubber sticky feet you put on the bottom so it doesn't scratch the table are small and great size.  Unfortunately there weren't nearly enough for me to use so I had to go to the store and find my own (but couldn't find ones of the same size).",human
"Update on review.  Seller is being difficult on return of an item that doesn't fit.They do fit, although they do tend to need pulled up somewhat frequently.  They do provide good support, but they are a bit of a challenge to put on.",human
They do exactly what you want. They beat alot of the wrinkles out in the dryer.,human
They hurt your feet,human
Arrived in great condition and on time.  We used this to make tissue paper flowers as decorations for my mother's 80th birthday and everyone loved them.  Great and inexpensive way to totally decorate a home and matchuse any color you need.,human

"The instructions refer to a spray bottle that seems to be made for this product.  Says to fill water to the line....well, there is no spray bottle included with this product.  First step was to scrounge around to find an appropriate size sprayer, then mix the product.First we cleaned the counter tops in the kitchen, did a descent job, it removed the obvious and kiddie fingerprints quite well.  In the bathroom we could see a great job on the chrome faucets, shower head etc.  Just wish this stuff was ready to go out of the box.",human
Don't stay on for long,human
"Very inexpensive for what you get. Seems well constructed and high quality for the price, and the ribbon to hang it is quite sturdy.",human
Very easy to use. Not bad for the price at all. Will definitely buy again if needed.,human
great safety item for elderly person or single people... alarm is very loud and would scare anyone away,human

"not as strong as other brands, but OK",human
"Great little tool for feet, hands and a good back rub.Wasn't sure they would be soft enough for a foot rub but oh yes they are great.the teal color balls are softer than the black so start with them.This is so good on your feet, just set it on the floor and put your foot on the ball,roll it around in circles or back and forth. Feels so good.Thanks for this deal. Also shipping was good as usual.",human
"I really wanted to love this product for international long haul flights. Unfortunately, the foot hammock doesn‚Äôt actually separate your feet and put didn‚Äôt do much in the way of elevating them either. I ended up just putting my feet up on the bag under my seat",human
So the white one worked for 4 days and never turned back on after that. Charged the toothbrush and it still won‚Äôt work. The black one is working okay. I would not buy again unfortunately.,human
There's no clear directions on the proper way to use it,human
"The advertisement states that this filter will last 10,000 litres2,500 gallons. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING! This is a big as a lie as &#34;Macs don't get viruses&#34;.  I've gone through 4 of these, and with only 1 person showering, it will not last for more than a month!",human

The balls at the ends a a little small but work perfectly,human
"The part was what I wanted, but it came in a paper envelope with NO protective padding.  I was fortunate it was in one piece.",human
"These were given to me. They fit my size 6 feet perfectly. Probably best for narrow feet, as the person who gave them to me has wider, swollen ankles and could not wear them.",human
"This works Amazing! Use a light spray though, I was a little too liberal and over sprayed. Tiny bottle but I can see it will last a good long time. No smearing of smudging and yes NO FOGGING! Finally found a anti fog spray that actually works.",human

Way smaller then I thought it would be,human
There is really no point in this product. It does not clean your teeth so it just feels like you didn‚Äôt brush your teeth at all.,human

"Do use this till you are very sure of what your doing.... this could severely damage your partner.That being said, NOTHING is sexier than this, OH and a warning (semi serious) make sure the floor under her is not slippery when wet....  .... because it will get wet.I don't suggest you secure this to anything external to her mass, meaning make sure that this thing doesn't end up hooking her like a fish.....  .... but yet, this thing brings instant submission without any real pain.",human

Taste good,human
The shampoo is very good. The lid is a bit shaky as I'm sure other reviews probably state but the shampoo is very good. It gets right into your scalp and works so well on all that annoying dandruff. My scalp is very dry and upset with pretty much any type of weather all year round. Currently it's mad at the sun and the end of summer weather. I used this and after three uses if felt and looked quite a bit better. I still have dandruff but it's an ongoing battle and this shampoo is really helping in the fight!I would recommend giving this a shot if you are having some issues. It does help. The lid is not the best made and it can leak a little but it's still worth it. Just be careful with the lid.,human
They suck,human
"For the price point, this is an excellent cuticle nipper. The edge is shard and precise. Comparable in quality to a $20 nipper.",human
This messager works really well.  It has a lot of torque and doesn't slow down when  trying to get those deep aches. It's super easy to use with 1button that controls the functions. it has 9 setting to cover any range of power that I need .  It relieves my back pain.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.,human
"I'm giving this product three stars, primarily due to the fact it is a knee scooter. And the pad where you put your knee is not very much padding at all in fact it's a willful attempted being a good pad and the covering that covers that is even worse. With very little use my wife having had foot surgery, the pad felt inadequate to begin and degrades very rapidly, and the fake leather whatever the covering is on it is made of is like starting to crack and maybe as durable as a wet paper towel maybe.That's the bad stuff now the good stuff is in terms of mobility and functionality this thing offers quick release adjustment on the handlebars which is far far superior to most of the other brands which you have to take the pin all the way out unscrew it all the way take it all the way out adjust the handlebars and then you have to store it somewhere not very Mobile in my opinion so this one's light years ahead of all of those.  Overall I have to say compared to what else is on the market this thing is a pretty good value for the money but it still leaves a lot to be desired. Having said that it is the one that we finally purchased. Similar to how we vote in the United States, sadly we had to choose between the better piece of garbage.",human

"I was abroad on business and with mere hours to go before my departing flight  I succumbed to temptation and purchased several pairs of a designer shoe, utterly gorgeous which had caught my eye several days previously.  I did not even have the time to try them on. Even the clerk's doubtful glances at my American size 8B feet failed to deter me. When I got home I had a formal event to attend and one of the shoes--as I thought it would--matched perfectly a gown I had decided to wear. Suffice to say that I had a bleeding heel at the end of the evening because I  had misread the Italian size charts.  The wound would not heal and was so sore it would wake me up at night. My dermatologist was on vacation but she had prescribed a self-adhesive foam dressing that  I used  up while she was away-- so I went on Amazon and using &#34;self adhesive foam dressing&#34; as my search term I came across this product. It specifically states it is for the heel so, expensive though it is, I bought it. It came promptly but even before I had tried it I had misplaced it  so I bought another.  Pardon this lengthy opening statement: I found the first box and took out the first sheet of the product---each dressing is sandwiched between two clean sheets of a plastic type material. I pulled out the first and removed the material protecting the adhesive, applied it to me heel and IT FELL OFF! There was no adhesive, none, nada zilch. I tried every dressing in the box and they were all the same--no adhesive! I then opened the second box and there was no adhesive on any of them.  I had spent $120 on nothing. A friend told me that the two boxes had different batch numbers so this is no isolated event (I had thrown the boxes away--my friend fished them out of the trash and told me about the batch numbers) Please do not buy this product.",human

"I bought this product at a golf shop, but feel compelled to provide this review on Amazon as a service to fellow golfers who travel by air ... this bag is incredible.  This bag is an exact fit for a complete set of clubs and their head covers.  It is light and balanced ... you will not believe how much easier it is to bring your golf clubs on a flight with this bag.  They fit easy in the trunk of the car with the rest of your luggage.  They are easy to carry around the airport.  They are easy to bring in and out of the hotel.There is a downside ... the clubs are tightly packed in the bag when it is on the back of the cart.  I solve this by keeping my putter and wedges out of the bag but inside the strap that holds the bag.  Not as convenient as a full size bag, but the convenience of getting your clubs around on the rest of your vacation far outweighs this inconvenience.  I do wish they would leave a little extra space at the top, though.In any case, well worth the price.",human

Potential Covid exposure due to failure of strings.I bought a lot of these. Halfway through the second package the strings are falling off. I had to stitch them before going out.

The picture on the left is my hand pump that produced just shy of 3.5oz pumped in 15 minutes immediately after using the hands free pump.

I recently purchased an outdoor canopy for my patio.  I knew I wanted to get LED lighting for the inside.  None of the local stores had anything that I wanted - a variable battery powered top ceiling light with a remote control.  I was happy when I found the Kruhlstein model online.  After I installed it I had an event that would test it's use with discerning friends.  Not only is the unit balanced using its built in hanging mount... but I only needed the center LED for normal use on a table 5' below.  When all the LED are on it was more than I expected.  It brought a very even bright light over the entire canopy area.  At first I thought the unit was smaller than I imagined.  But after experiencing the results I was happy it was the efficient size that it was.  I'd recommend this product for any use in outdoor canopies or areas you are able to hang this over.,human

"We actually bought this for my space- obsessed son to use as his ""tooth fairy box"" for lost teeth.  We used it for the first time this weekend and I can report that the box closed tightly and securely enough that the tooth was safe despite a lot of jostling around by a very excited 5-year-old, yet still easy enough to open that the fairy had no trouble recovering the tooth with her tiny delicate hands.I guess you could also use it for medication without worrying about it coming open in your bag.

"What a great idea to place all you would need in a bundle‚Ä¶  This Blackhead and Blemish Remover Bundle - includes a 5 piece stainless steel Comedone extractor kit, deep cleansing peel off mask, and a charcoal Konjac sponge.  The kit contains a spoon shaped extractor, a lancet, a thin angled curette (looped shape) extractor, a curve angled curette (looped shape) extractor, and other angled curette extractors of different shapes and sizes for hard to reach and delicate areas.  It also comes with clear instructions on how to use each piece.  Before using the kit your face should be really clean and I used the deep cleansing peel off black mud face mask the night before.  I applied the mask and left it on for about 30 minutes and then peeled it off.  My skin has a little tingle sensation and felt cleaner and I also applied toner afterwards.  This bundle pack also comes with a charcoal Konjac sponge which is extremely hard, but once it is wet is softens and you use it to exfoliate the oily areas on your skin.  It‚Äôs hard to describe but my face felt completely fresh and clean after this treatment and I did have a little redness but it didn‚Äôt last long.  I did not use all of the extractors but tried some.  It will take a little practice getting use to using tools to extract blackheads and blemishes.  I think this is a great bundle pack at a very reasonable price and I will purchase more of the black mud face mask and more of the Konjac sponges.Disclosure:  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and the opinions are my own.",human

"My uncle lost his vision almost overnight to a genetic disorder. That he is in his 60's and has suffered from many years of surgeries and dialysis procedures, he has severe neuropathy in his hands and is unable to learn braille. When he received the Talking Money Identifier, it put a bounce in his voice! He likes to tease now that he knows what his wife is taking from him when she asks for money. For the fact that it can read the bill for him when he's out on a date, and no longer has to rely on his wife to tell him what he's receiving or giving in cash when he's out and about, this product more than paid for itself the day he opened the box.

"It happens every few months that I cave in to the little merry maid on my back and buy something touted as being 'revolutionary' for storage.  I believe it has to do with the happy-dancing-singing-frolicking-""I can't believe how much better my life is now that I have a place for all of my crab dip""-type advertisements that inundate my subconscious when I fall asleep in front of the tv in the ""paid presentation"" hours of the morning.  But I digress.Colors are good.  The idea has merit.  The execution, however, could use some massaging.My first issue:  The carousel system is chintzy.  In particular, the container supports.  I almost sheered a couple off in my methodical scramble to assemble it and have a better life.My second issue:  The container caps don't really fit into the alotted slot.  Perhaps I was misinterpreting the diagram that showed them fitting into their container stall.  Maybe they just sent me a rowdy bunch of non-conformists.  I'm not sure.  But they just don't seem to be happy fitting in where they should.My third issue:  I almost poked an eye out when the ""flip-out"" function deployed unexpectedly and caught me by surprise.  While I was putting it in my cabinet and anticipating all of the happiness my impending purchase would bring to me, the containers shifted and attacked me.  Be wary.  They're wiley.All-in-all, the idea is pretty good.  Maybe it just takes more than colored, spinnning, plastic containers to bring true bliss to my life.",human

"As I work outside in cold and windy weather for my falls, I wanted to get these to help try to keep me warm. The idea is good, but this product has its issues.First off, I have paired the remote several times and it just flat out does not work. At all. Ever. Kinda defeats the point of having a remote at all.I wear a size 11.5 shoe, but got the Large size and cut it to fit a 12, and that somehow is still to small? My toes hang over the edge of the insert.So barring that the remote does not work, I have been turning them on manually with the button. But they just turn themselves off kind of whenever they feel like it. I have set a timer to see if it is a timed off thing and it is very clearly not. I can‚Äôt even make a remark about the battery life because I don‚Äôt even know when they are on and off.All the bad stuff said, when they are actually on and work they do work well and are fairly comfortable to wear.A small note is that you should check to see if you have the clearance for an insert in your shoes. Luckily the insert in my shoes was really beat up and needed to be taken out anyways. They are a little thicker than normal inserts so there is some food for thought.",human

Even the peach hairs you can't see very well....SHAVE THEM. The prep lotion helps but not as much as you would think. Great product, covers very well.",human
WORKS GREAT,human
Works great!,human
"What a difference! I can't believe anybody has lived at all without one. A little cumbersome sitting down, but great to sue.",human
A good dietary supplement to help with fat loss. Best used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise program.,human
"Very good shisha. First time trying fantasia. Love it, especially the rainbow flavor",human
"Thin but very opaque. Nice long hadles like a plastic grocery bag. Packaging is all in chinese but its not important. Anyone who has used a small garbage bag will be able to figure out what to do. You have to completely unwrap one of the 3 rolls so you can unroll each bag from the outside of the roll. It will have a perforated area at the bottom of the bag where it connects to the bag that comes after. Like i said, its very thin but fully useable. I like them.",human
"I like that I can use these bottles and they wrap up with the safety catch, like a brand new bottle of whatever.",human
"This is a unique type of floss dispenser. I like that it is refillable. It came with an extra 100 meter refill which is a lot of floss. The floss is high quality and tastes like natural mint. It is strong and easy to use. The metal container is cute too. Everything is made in Germany. I was happy about that since I have noticed that many floss companies have moved their manufacturing to polluted China. I would highly recommend this for its cuteness, quality, function and having less going into landfills.",human
Great purchase!,human
"great product, very fine &#34;grit&#34; leaves skin feeling very smooth",human
"I seriously love it. It's small enough for travel. It only has one vibe, but I honestly feel as though it's all you'll need. Not to mention the fact that it comes with four caps to change the sensation that you feel. Those are great. My only issue was that it wasn't as quiet as I thought it would be, but it's already so good that you wouldn't want anyone else around anyways. Unless you have a partner X3.I'm also pretty happy with the delivery speed as well.",human
I like the tint on lenses ...takes some pressure off vision,human
I have tried 5 different body soaps on this silicone back scrubber but none of them really get to my skin and lather nicely. I have to put it on my back then press against my tile walls just to get the soap to touch my back. Other then that it works amazing and shipping was fast!,human
"Very good hot water bottle plus handsome sleeve with reindeers ‚Äì gives very Christmas-y mood, especially when you feel the warmth from this bottle. The only thing is missing is spiced rum punch.My hands and feet are often cold - no matter what. I was very excited to see this hot water bottle pack. We used to have one many years ago but then fancy electrical came and nobody used such hot water bottles anymore. The order arrived very fast and was packaged very nicely. The package came with instructions about how to fill the water bottle and close it properly - it also came with warnings about extremely hot water and using this item with children.  It was so easy to fill the water bottle and the cap was very secure upon closing the water bottle - no leaksspills so far!! The covers are very soft and cozy - but I did notice that the covers did take away from a bit of the warmth that the bottle gave off. I filled the bottle as instructed and it very nicely warmed up my feet - but I chose to take off the cover first. It really is all about preference and how hot the water is that you place in the bottle. Such a warm, cozy, adorable and cost efficient way to stay warm! Please click Yes if my review was helpful for you.",human
perfect quality,human
"My children broke two in the girst 24 hours, one was broke when they were delivered.",human

Fun,human
Great for getting my pans to look new again.,human
"This is absolute garage. Directions are in Chinese only, pretty self-explanatory! Didn't even remove fine small scratches. Complete waste of money.",human
feel great,human
I didn‚Äôt like that it comes completely separated. Very time consuming,human
"Simple, but works wonderfully.",human
Just as great as the original in my FLX Ride Rocky boots. Those lasted a year of super heavy use (horse trainer in MN). Hopefully these will last as long..so far a month in and still great.,human
was great,human
Great product to use between details. Keeps that classic shine going.,human
This ribbon is just what I wanted for my outdoor wreath.,human
"I recently had an pen break in my jeans pocket, so I went onto Amazon and purchased Quick N Brite Ink Stain remover.  I followed the instructions on the bottle and then threw my jeans in the wash.  Came out with no stain.  Great bargain, the brush and microfiber cloth alone are worth the ten bucks!  Way cheaper than buying new jeans!",human
"Looks good, quality is good but it's way too big ( i ordered size S for my newborn) but this wearable blanket is way-way too big ( size S is about 35 inches long) . Have to return it.",human
This was a gift for a friend,human
"Goes on effortlessly, really pleased with the results, i highly recommend,",human
"I gave it 5 stars on all but ""ergonomic."" Maybe they're taking that but weird thing to review. I used it on a healing tattoo and the itchiness was immediately gone.  It didn't sit on my skin like aloe products do.",human
"A little too hard, not sexflesh so the head isn't flexible at all.",human
The sticker quality is great! My laptop case is cute and it officially looks mine!,human
No me agrado que se haya desparramado todo y pues uno paga por recibir lo que ordena,human
Good quality for the price,human
Best pair of toenail clippers ever.  I will have to hide these beauties. Not kidding.,human
