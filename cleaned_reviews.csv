Very prett but delicate!!,human
"Not kidding. This product (Swanson branded Chicken Sternum Cartilage Collage tabs) took the better part of half a day to make walking easier and pain-free.I'll try to keep this short.There is this gonzo medic person who wrote a book and gives lectures titled ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie"". He mentioned in one of his semars that someone figured out to fix damaged joints you need to take chicken bones and cut off the ends. The joint ends. Then grind that down to a powder and feed it to people with joint issues, will work wonders. So I went looking on Amazon for 'chicken bone' product, closest I came to was Swanson's chicken sternum cartilage collagen product..I had previous knee wear damage from an overly enthusiastic exercise regimen (no pain, no gain), being old and overweight made it get worse with time. When I took the Swanson product I felt relief within the day. Can't recommend it enought.Thank you for reading this.",human
Exactly what I know from France and needed,human
Nice tattoo. It lasted a few days even with showers. Would definitely consider repurchasing.,human
"I used their blue wax last time, I ordered this one to try a gentler one but it came damaged and spilled, there was no replacement option.",human
Always liked this brush,human
Wonderful Pink Floyd hat. My husband loves it! Perfect fit. Thank you.,human
Love the smell!! Glade I tried them.  They make my entire house smell very wonderful.Will order again.,human
"the supplement had the same exact wrapping on the supplement os the one I thought I was ordering and after receiving  it read the ingredients and it was the wrong sup. the app did not have where I could read the ingredients. that if it had I wouldn't have ordered it. Sarah Bruno, I reported them to the company that i wanted the supplement to come  from.",human
"If you like snacking Yacon Slices are ideal.  Slightly moist and chewy and sweet.  I, however, am not a 'snacker'.  I bought them for the gut benefits.  Yacon contains a prebiotic, Inulin, which breaks down into a probiotic, fructoogligosaccharides, which helps promote a healthy, happy gut.  Yacon is a pleasant way to keep your microbiome happy.",human
"Based on a reputable review, I chose this product and I have no complaints or concerns. The capsule is reasonably easy to swallow. There is a bit of orange dust in the bottle which apparently shakes out of the capsules. The formulation includes bioprene to enhance absorption. The price is very competitive for the quality.",human
"This has been a pretty nice hookah so far! I love the design and it’s something new and fun compared to the typical hookah design. I really like the heat management device and it works great and evenly disturbs the heat and airflow throughout the device. The top of the hookah is acrylic and scathes so easily, so be careful when washing or using it. The hose is alright, nothing special but gets the job done. I can only imagine that cleaning is going to be a bit difficult based on the shape of the device, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get to it.",human
"I've been buying this for a long time, it does everything it says it will.  It cleans up pet stains, and other stains too!  It takes care of odours well!  I discovered this at a cat show years ago, and loved it right away.  Yes, it's a bit expensive, it also takes very little to do the job.",human
"Very nice, can't wait to finish my current journal to get to use this one!",human
worthless,human
I use it all time to get rid of the dogs smell in my house.  It works and the unscented version doesn't bother my nose or theirs.,human
It is very pretty and came quickly. The one I received had a loose door that with too much movement would pop open. I was able to bend the clasp some to keep it from flying open but is does still &#34;clink&#34; when moving as the door does not stay tight. I do really enjoy the fragrance and the ability to wear it wherever I go.,human
This is a great product.  Definitely helps in healing the skin.  I recommend it!,human
I got this because my home water flosser decided it didn’t want to work anymore. I’m so glad I did!! I also have braces and this helps me get in those hard to clean areas. I like that it’s not bulky and I can take it anywhere I go!,human
"I really liked this product because you can use it on ANY jewelry ( although I haven’t tried marcasite because of the liquid properties) so I bought it again. It is not chemical I believe and does not harm pearls or costume jewelry ( fashion) yet you can do gold and diamonds.  I clean quite a bit of jewelry. I still recommend a silver polishing cloth( jewelry polishing cloth) for most silver to keep the natural beauty of the oxidation, or “ tarnish” that is sometimes intentionally put there. This is very gentle on silver though, unlike the dips and cleaners that strip away the beauty of the silver.",human
Very handy!  I did not like the sponge a curved handle would have been nice.  The shoe horn and item pickup were very helpful!,human
"It was just too complex for me to figure out how to do. But, just because I couldn't figure it out, doesn't mean you won't. I give it a rating of 2 stars",human
It's exactly as pictured and described. I can't find any fault in the container.,human
Awesome product!,human
Work 12 hours on my feet with planters fasciitis but since inserting into my shoesThe pain is now a 1 rather than a 8 its been 3 weeks of pleasant happy feet.,human
They don’t stay put and move around and stretch,human
"As someone who does their own nails ... these are COARSE buffers for regular, gel, or acrylic nails.However, I really got them for my rough feet. I live in the desert and most of the time I wear flip-flops out. That results in rough, dry, scaly feet. Not even scrubs work. So, I choose a coarse grit buffer andor file.That does the job! These are also way easier to hold than a file. And, I get into most of the places.Pretty happy with them. Packaging could be better for storage though.",human
Absolutely didn’t help or feel comfortable at all.,human
We all know that beauty comes from the inside and adding this to your routine it’s going to benefit you a lot.,human
"I have used a few different brands of CBD skin salves, and this one works the best. Relief is temporary no matter what product you use, but I have found the effects of Hemp Salvation last the longest. I like the way the salve gradually creates a warming sensation on the skin. I have terrible back pain, and this gets me through some of the worst moments.",human
Very cheap. Do not recommend.,human
Not well made  material is a hard itchy plastic blend. Oddly designed and fits even stranger. Spend some more money and get a better quality and designed piece. Your body will thank you for it.,human
Had a small problem wiring because the wiring diagram was not included. Watched video on you tube  to address the problem. Other than that it works and solved the problem we had withe the button remote that came with our unit originally. We like the dual functionality of a card pass or pin.,human
I bought this to exfoliate my skin and it does a great job.  No surprises here.  It is exactly what I needed.,human
The splint holds the foot in place without placing too much stress on it. It has a good amount of padding so it is very comfortable to wear and doesn't hurt the skin. I could actually see a change and benefit of wearing it after just 4 days of wearing it nightly. Price is good so it is great value especially if you are trying a splint for the first time.,human
These are a life saver!  Working as a teacher these have helped tremendously with being able to breath all day in my mask. Definitely recommend these.,human
This works good. Usually have to buy just the eyebrow shaver for more and I have to worry about finding a battery. This has more attachments and a USB charger. Glad I got it!,human
"It's very cushioning; however, it's very slippery, it made my heels slip out with every step I take.",human
Like how it charges instead of battery usage. Texture is like very strong foam. Very durable.  The lowest setting seems a little strong however works good for me.,human
"A great product at a great price. Delivery was the very next day, I couldn't believe it.",human
"All natural, no harmful side effects, love it!!!!  Will always buy this. If you have not tried it, you should.",human
Wonderful Iron tablets for menstruating women. gives you the energy and replaces the iron lost on your cycles heaviest days!,human
Excellent toothpaste. Especially like the clove flavor and being free of artificial sweeteners,human
Product passes undigested. Do not use,human
Perfect fit! and water tight. Best ear plugs for swimming I've ever bought.,human
It works great. Feels good. I was able to wear it all day within a week.,human
"This product is too cumbersome to effectively support the wrist. The thumb hole is too small and the fabric is too big. There is not enough strap to isolate the wrist and too much for the hand. It secures as a straight line, and the wrist is loose which is not effective. The other problem is that the material is too slick, so when I try to stand up, there is no support if I use the brace on my wrist, and without the brace my shoulder hurts.The only real as on I gave this a two is because the tourmaline part is stuck on with Velcro and I was able to stick it onto my old brace and use it. The tourmaline layer was the reason I chose this brace.",human
Works as expected. Very good value.,human
"I like the look and feel of these glasses. Lense is as clear as you'll get without prescription. A little wide, even for my round face. They get the job done but definitely aren't my favorite pair.",human
Good quality and like being able to reach across the back.,human
These are awesome for thirsty and hot feet. The feel of the squishiness is very comforting.  Wonderful relief.,human
"I had a few of these with the hex head stripped off.  These things were not easy to find.  I was very pleased that they are identical to the ones I had and fit perfectly.  The original ones I had were used a few years ago to install a mesh cover made by Anchor (I believe).  One recommendation is to keep them clean and lubed every season.  The hex heads will strip very easy if using a drill bit to work with and they're stuck due to dirt or other debris that can get in there over a few seasons.  I nearly rated them a 4 due to how easy the hex head became striped, but they are brass, and brass is soft.  Keep them clean and lubed and this shouldn't happen.  Workmanship on these are very good.",human
Super cute and great material. My son is 2 and wiling to wear it so must be comfortable,human
"The cider vinegar does seem to improve digestion. Not that I have a particular problem. The Cider Vinegar gets me through the day without noticing digestive nuance.They taste good at the end of my supplement taking session. I like them. Try them for a week, and you might notice a benefit.",human
"I'm pleased with the bikini shaver.  It doesn't  pinch or scrape my skin.  I will be using the other tools that it came with and expect I will like those as well!  Blessings,  Linda",human
Arrived with a large puncture whole in the side of the box and when I opened it there were several broken pieces.,human
"This is working out well for me. It's very thin material so it doesn't add bulk to the chair arm. The top of it is flat and you could put a mug or glass on it, but it doesn't seem too substantial (sort of like there is stiff cardboard under the material). I have used it, adding a coaster under the glass. I like the pocket arrangement, the three small ones are the right size for a cell phone, TV remote, or pill bottles. No complaints; while it is thin, it does not seem cheap to me.",human
I take these amino acids as well as the Essential VitaminsMinerals from TrueHope to help taper off benzodiazepines and they are incredible. I feel better within an hour having more energy and a more positive outlook. I truly can say I love this product.,human
"The food is really good, I was surprised. The shakes are tasty and filling with a little boost of energy.",human
"Collagen is a fantastic supplement for so many reasons! It's great for your hair, skin, nails, gut, immune system, and more! This powder is super easy to incorporate into your diet. My favorite way to take it is to blend it into my morning protein smoothie. It virtually disappears and you'd have no idea it was even there. You can also add it to both hot and cold drinks, sprinkle it on your yogurt, add it to soup, bake with it, etc... It's super easy to sneak into almost anything. This powder is nice and fine and seems to be nice quality. This is a little more expensive than other varieties I've seen though. Usually you can get a 1lb tub of collagen powder for about the same price as this and this is only 10 ounces, so it's not the best deal, but it does seem to be good quality.",human
I have used this product for at least 12 years and would be devastated if I couldn’t continue to purchase it. It helps so much with digestion - I’m gluten intolerant and take one when ever I cheat. It settles my stomach very quickly.,human
"Hands down, the most effective foot file I’ve ever owned. I’m all set with the cheese graters. This is metal, but gentle and it rules!",human
Great for my daughters birthday.  She loved them.,human
"I've been a KT tape user for years and like that product quite well but as time has gone on it has gotten more and more expensive so I looked for an alternative and found Oribi. I have to say I like it better than my previous tape. It allows you to reposition, if necessary, without compromising the adhesion, stays stuck really well even after running, sweating and showering for days and still removes easily without the red irritated skin. You do need to follow the directive of rubbing it to create heat to activate the adhesive but once that's done it really performs well. Great product at a reasonable price.",human
Love these tiny toothbrush they are Just  amazing swishthem back and forth and teeth from front to back are clean!,human
These customizable labels are perfect! We ordered them and got them very quickly for our son’s graduation party. They’re very sturdy as well.,human
"Simple, no-nonsense hot tub pillow, and the &#34;notch&#34; in the back works great in many places in the hot tub. Love the fact that suction cups stay on when you need them to, but the pillow can be moved easily. This is a small pillow - which is great for going in the crook of your neck and staring at the stars! I don't like the color though. But at the time it was the only color I could find. I would buy it again though.",human
Great feeling to please,human
"What a practical item.  I just received the log book today and it is just as I expected it would be, practical and easy to use.  I log all my expenses into the book and I can be assured that I don't miss a payment on anything.  The book is a great tool to stay organized and in controll of your finances.  I would and will purchase another one of these books for future use.",human
just what I needed,human
"I like the style of this pocket diaper and it is a lot more trim than others that we have, the insert is just ok. It holds well as a day time diaper for 2 maybe 3 hours. Like the design though.",human
Its nice sticker,human
Product missing door anchors so it’s useless.,human
Good quality bit small definatly for a kid,human
Served the purpose for what they were purchased for.,human
Good quality.,human
These were ok. Served the purpose okay but not great.,human
"Product is super close to expiration date, not acceptable specially for a product that is for babies! Additionally seller did not even bother to answer my message! Don't buy anything from this seller!",human
This stuff unclogged my heater core when nothing else would.  Says not to leave it in more that 2.5 hours so I did that the firat time but the core was still clogged.  So I did a second round and left it in 5 hours and it worked!,human
Friends coming to visit are amazed with this scent,human
This works awesome no mice or any critters in my rv so far.,human
"I ordered this for my  grandson.He loves it.Scooby Doo is one of his favorite shows, so he was excited to receive this activity bookI also liked that it came with a set of coloring crayons and a growth chart.",human
"Update: I just used less & now it taste decent didn’t want it to go to waste so I have been experimenting with the amount.I have tried other Matchas, but this is too strong & has no flavor of matcha",human
Warning this is not a two pack. You only get one of them but it has a bar code on the back that says two pack.,human
I love this pill organizer! The shape and size makes it way easier to put in a purse or other bag and I like that it’s a hard case that won’t get damaged as easily as some of the cutesy fabric bags. The “handle” of the case is how it closes and I can’t get over how adorable that is.,human
"Bought this for a friend who suffers from sever chronic migraines - she enjoys it a lot, but I also got one for myself cause it feels awesome. Then again, I'll buy anything that comes in that color...",human
This stuff really does keep your glasses on. I use it daily. It's especially good for workouts and when I run outside I use it on my sunglass. The only drawback is that the wax leaves a film if you get it on your lenses and you'll need a towel to get it off.,human
Works as advertized!,human
"Freaking love these.  They cost more than ones in the grocery store, but they do not hurt my head.  I can barely feel them on.  Would buy again and again and again.",human
"AUNTIE TAKING AS ANTI-CANCER  TREATMENT. SHE IS NOT GETTING WORSE, DOCTORS HAD NO TREATMENTS !",human
They're too thick.  This will only work if the shoe is too big.  I needed something to keep my toes from sliding into the point of the shoe and when I insert the toe plug I can't put my shoe on.  What a waste.,human
Got this as a potential replacement for my Philips trimmer... wanted something more narrow.  But this one didn’t work as well and hurt my sensitive skin far more than my Philips 😟,human
Always a great product. Smells good. Eliminates odor well.,human
This product is smaller then want I was expecting. Cool little device that can pump out powders with ease. Does make a lot of dust in the air when using,human
"Perfect, heavy duty.",human
Great noise reduction in bulk for a great price; highly recommend them if you are responsible for firing range activities,human
"Arrived on time and no jars were cracked or broken.  I love this stuff for skin care and massaging.  It takes a long time to rub it in, so unless you are using it for massage...apply sparingly.  It smells amazing and everyone I have used it on agrees.",human
"Perfect for my wedding chairs! It matched my alter splendidly ❤️ They are very fragile, be careful. I did actually prefer the darker side of these, but couldn’t flip them to use that color. Still perfect though!",human
"Product is quality but I didn’t use it consistently and didn’t see a difference so stopped using. I think long term is the way to use it, after writing this will attempt to use again and will update my review.",human
Beautiful and good condition.,human
Many of my bags had holes in them at the bottom and could not be fixed so I didn't have enough for what I needed them for.,human
This was expired when I received it. Given the nature of the product I don't feel comfortable testing it fully. It's unscented and feels pretty silky. Would be a good gag gift.,human
I love it is def helping with back and sciatic issues,human
"Really sad this heating pad didn't heat. Very soft and packaged with it's own nylon sleeve, but that doesn't bring relief to achy muscles. Sadly had to return.",human
for work and it works,human
"Haven't used yet,  but appears to be good quality. Arrived with no damage to package or contents.  Battery was at 85% , which is great! Currently on charger for use this evening.  Updated: shaver isn't the quietest.  Shaving head protective cover is a bit difficult to snap in place.  The shaver does work well,  and shaves pretty close.  I  like it.  Knocked one star for the cover",human
"Forget about this if you have trouble with big pills. It's shorter but almost round and the gelcap is sticky. It got stuck and I was choking. I just ordered the liquid. I hadn't been taking omega 3's and my husband kinda pushed it on me. So yes, I should take it, but forget trying to swallow something like this. Mini? nope.",human
Perfect size. Leaves residue on hands after handling.,human
"Not very comfortable,  cant keep it on to long",human
This is a rip-off do not purchase. They advertise two bottles of vitamins but only send one bottle,human
This is a great product just as advertised,human
"I use the RustGo a lot and love it so I assumed this would be as good, it wasn't. I followed the directions clearly and have yet to be able to remove ink from anything.",human
"This is a decent water floss, but the real pro here is that this is portable and definitely easy to travel with. If you’re looking for something that meets this criteria, I would highly recommend.",human
I have no idea how to use this. There’s no power button on the curler or any indicator on where to turn it on. The box it came in was a little smashed but the rest of the things are okay.,human
"A little heavy, but its great.",human
This body wash smells wonderful. The foam makes it feel luxurious too.,human
Love this stuff. Works wondefully.,human
"Warning this product may be adulterated. I’ve taken fermented glutamine almost my entire life because of ongoing stomach issues. This is not 100% pure L glutamine. First of all it taste like chalk and is sour tasting.  Second, look at the pictures uploaded to Amazon’s website compared to the photo I have uploaded.  It lists other ingredients as gelatin glycerin enteric coating and purified water. Are you kidding me? This is not 100% pure glutamine.",human
"well made, good price, and quick service on delivery",human
"They do ok for the price, I have to fold down the top unless I want a cowlick in the morning. They are easily snagged so I have to trim the edges every so often.",human
This scale is accurate for weight and as far as body fat goes nothing is perfect but it does give you a guide. I am updating this review after only 3 months. Scale no longer works. The set button does not function. Scale is stuck in setup mode and just keeps flashing. Set button will not work so scale is no longer functional. I would buy another model or brand.,human
Great after broken wrist and pulled tendon,human
this was requested with the starter kit and is used regularly.,human
I have seen a tremendous difference in my hair and the shine,human
"The bottom is starting to leak. The first 50 cups we didn't have a problem with, but now I'm hesitant to use the rest of them.",human
"These do not fit my face as well as other goggles, but I won't hold that against them.  They're just not the right shape for me.  They might work great for you.  The polarized lenses seem to do the trick, though I have only tested them in a sunlit, indoor pool and not in the open water.  They definitely fog up like crazy, even moreso than my other goggles, so that feature disappointed me enough to reduce them to 3 stars.",human
These work well if you can’t reach your back in the shower 🚿.,human
"This is not a one size fits all. The head either aligns perfectly with the notches, or it doesn't fit right. Additionally, getting the blindfold part perfectly aligned with the ball gag is another impossibility (again, unless the wearer is perfectly aligned with the notches). Of course, throw in hair and this third complication makes for a unit that doesn't fit right...meaning the eyes aren't covered, the mouth isn't silenced, and the sub can just literally slip out of it like Houdini. This just tries to be too many things and doesn't do anything right in the process.",human
I got six essential oils for a really good price but the smell doesn’t last very long but they do smell really good worth of money,human
Didn't notice any significant changes in my appetite.,human
No more problems with hats being a little too tight. Fixed 3 ball caps so far. Love it!,human
"The five star rating is because they are so cute and a fun item to use on letters, packages, and the like.  I love to display my favorite animal on my cosrrrespondence to family and friends.  (Business correspondence - well, no.)  I'm an adult that has loved the panda since childhood and still collect figurines,  pictures, etc.  This tape is useable in any length of  tape or individuallly by cutting what is wanted.  Makes me smile when I see and use the tape. I definitely would recommend this prduct to anyone who loves pandas or just animals for a fun item to use.  I like the tape period.",human
This curler for eyelashes is amazing.  It doesn't burn you if used appropriately.  Make sure you are wearing mascara when you use it.  Reapply another coat of mascara after you curl eyelash.  I find it even keeps a slight curl after removing mascara.,human
Says for men or women however the package states men’s compression socks,human
"These are not the same width as E track. They're narrower. So they do nothing. In addition to that, these are not ABS - they're some weaker plastic that feels cheap. I returned them.",human
This is my third try with a battery powered nail tool and I finally found the one that works best for me.  The callus remover works beautifully.,human
"Great service! Fast delivery! Just what I wanted, Thamks, again!",human
Amazing product! Real sea moss! Will purchase again!,human
"I have ordered 4 of this type vacuum grab bars, the first two were sold as I each and the first one I opened was screwed up by the packaging in that the vacuum part had been made ""out of round"" so didn't fit flat to the surface. Returned that one for credit and found that the second one works pretty well.  Needing more, I ordered this 2 pack but find that they also do not work as advertised and could not be trusted by someone needing help to get in or out of a bathtub.",human
"I love the lavender color. It is soooo cute. Also, it works well on curling the hair. 💕",human
I did not get any of the gold balloons as pictured. Some balloons had holes in them which means it could not be inflated. The balloon glue was a joke and did not stick at all.,human
Work as described,human
"It provided no results after 30 days, and caused nauseousness while taking. Had to stop taking. I do not recommend this product.",human
I can't have menthol.  These are the only drops I can find without menthol or soy additives which I also can't have.The honey in the drops is very soothing for my throat.,human
"We unfortunately watched a youtube video of a tonsil stone and now my husband is obsessed with them! He purchased this remover (toothbrush and flosser weren't cutting it anymore) and is not super happy with it.  It does work for removing stones, but is cheaply made and the light does not work on it.  The storage case is nice, but would not purchase it again.....In face would have returned it, but didn't want to pay shipping on it :.NOT RECOMMENDED!",human
"I live in an apartment with a tiny catio, but with I planted a whole flat of marigolds in one of these that really makes my neighbors happy -- something I didn't even know was a thing. Sturdy, sleek, strong, and it arrived in a timely manner which is not what usually happens these days. Very, very good deal.",human
"Purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder.  It IS less messy than regular powder, however, it doesn't work as well.  And it is oddly... greasy?  He reports that it is lotiony in a weird way.  Since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry.  If it's lotiony or greasy, not so much.If you're hoping for a replacement for powder - this isn't it - at least in my husband's opinion.",human
"I was very impressed with this product as I have never used anything Like this before. The balls were comfortable, packaged discreetly and very easy to clean. I think its best with you start with the smallest and work your way up to the biggest one. I liked how comfortable they were as well. Totally Recommended!",human
"I have had this chair since it first came out.  I could not live as I do without it.  It gives me the ability to live alone and still take care of all my needs--especially in the kitchen.  It's rather large and I have done considerable damage to my house because it requires a lot of room to turn. The lift motor did fail, but fortunately for me, it was in the warranty period and they replaced the motor at no cost to me.  I think I'm going to have to replace the batteries soon as they don't hold a charge very long as they did at first.  Even with it's shortfalls, I love this chair for the freedom it gives me to remain independent and not have to beg help from anyone else.",human
Good quality and work as well as name brand.,human
NOT WOT WORTH THE COST!!!,human
Lovely fragrance and helps with pain control.,human
"The design of this device is simple, but it works very well. It takes a little getting used to, but has kept me from having cramps in my hands. After being on the computer all day at work I couldn't keep up with crocheting, my favorite hobby. Now I can!",human
Loved everything about it except that it broke after 2 months so I returned it.,human
thank you,human
"I ve tried other brands, this one does good brushing and clean my teeth. One tablet is a little too spare, two are perfect. Wish the peppermint is stronger though. Easy to use, and appreciated its friendly packaging.",human
Didn't seem to do anything for me.,human
Good enough for kids to play!!,human
Good product but doesn't work as well as advertized,human
"Following the instruction on the item, poured whole bottle into the slow drain at my shower, waited for 8 hours. The slow drain is still slow as before. This product does not work at all. Do not get cheated by the 'Guaranteed to work' on the bottle.",human
This is my favorite shaving foam and I've tried all kind of gels and creams and everything and I love the smell of this as well and I get a good close shave,human
"The part with the heel back doesn’t stick at all...works to add a little padding but won’t stick to shoes...therefore inferior product. Since they don't stick, it's very difficult to step into your shoes without the product coming loose and bunching up in shoes.",human
I have a phillips Sonicare - Flex care and this toothbrush head is perfect .......and I also really appreciate the price.,human
"WOW!Okay so it says &#34;discretely packaged&#34; which is true to an extent as Chinese customs lists the product on the label as &#34;sex toys&#34; - Aside from that, you get the standard dark grey plastic - Be cautious when opening as the products (bondage set) came shipped in a zip-lock type bag which fits exactly to the shipping package.Full disclosure... Yes, I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review - I've worked with several review groups through the years and work with sellers directly. I am not compensated for my review & am proud to maintain a high level in the &#34;review&#34; rankings.Now here's the 2nd part to full disclosure - Total newbie. No, not a virgin type of newbie (2 kids) but to this type of product and associated behavior, yes, a total newbie.Not only am I really looking forward to the surprise but I've had to ensure I could actually use them... So:The feather handle is a little short so he had a sense of where I was standing.The blind fold goes on but doesn't stay in place. The lining is soft to the touch and prevents redness. I haven't gotten the gag or tying up parts yet...Maybe this weekend.Since there wasn't any literature - pictures or otherwise that came with the set I've got to do a little research... That's really the only reason I've given it a 4-star review - I don't want to do the research - Give me a couple examples and I'd have been at 5 stars. Great set for a newbie.  It's definitely piqued my interest in further exploration ~ And wondering if this is something that is introduced in small doses or one goes &#34;all out&#34; when they do?

"A safe way to keep my nitroglycerin with me. Gives me peace of mind to have a bottle with at all times, but I don't want the bottle just in my purse as it is glass and nitroglycerin so having it securely on my keys is perfect.I would repurchase this item.",human

"Useless; the spring is bigger and coarser than other brands I've tried, and didn't even epilate.  I felt nothing pulling or epilating when I used it, but did when I  immediately tried  my older wand from another company.  I threw these 2 away.  Thankfully, they were not expensive.

Bought this for my boyfriend since he travels a lot for work. He loves it and says he likes how precise the trimmer gets. I also bought it in conjunction with the aftershave balm which he LOVES and helps with shave bumps and it’s non greasy. Plus it smells so good!,human

Theses are  okay..,human
"It's Perfect. If you need to monitor your BPHR etc, this is all you need. Exceeded expectations; quality, features, look and ease of use. On point measuring accuracy; Side by side pulse-Ox comp.done. Appreciated the Fast shipping and careful packaging. At the price it's a sure bargain. I definitely recommend for purchase.",human
this thing is huge.. so I'm disappointed and now I'll be sending it back.  The problem I had was it is NOT as well built as people said on here. The actual sides are each ok and seem to be solid..however the hinge is cheap and doesn't line up the 'cups' so it's just very annoying and seems like it'll fall apart easily.Sending Back!!!,human
The spray is not as good as the balm for pain ant cramp relief. Also the relief is not as long lasting.,human

Assembling the peddler was very easy, and did not require much time.Although there are not many levels of resistance,  l simply LOVE this peddler. It is a great tool for those sitting behind desks most of the day...incorporates motion and gets the blood flowing!The unit is light enough to carry, but heavy enough to keep it from sliding when using it on tile flooring.I purchased the white unit which has a unique  appreciated hand grip to carry. It's actually a conversation piece, and I do not mind having it displayed in my space.Thank YOU, Goredi!",human

"Having occipital neuralgia is crazy painful. It hurts to lay on a pillow. Having POTS can make heat too hot and cold too cold. Like, Goldilocks, this was just right.

Best to use only until you get relief, which doesn’t take long.Smart design that resembles a bicycle seat on one side. Thankful for my hands free acupressure.",human

"Seriously, don't buy this wig! It looks nothing like the one shown on Amazon! When it was delivered to me, the long part was in a pony tail. While this was probably to make shipping it easier, it ended up ruining the wig, because the part that was in a pony tail was tangled so bad that I had to throw it out. I mean, I know wigs can get tangled but they should not get tangled as badly as this one. Especially sense all I did was put it on a wig head and brush it out.",human

"The scrubber is great quality and easy to use. I am a rather small flexible human who doesn't have any issues situating the scrubber in order to scrub my back, however I'm sure those with low flexibility or a large backshoulders could still have some issues.

"I wasn't sure about these things so I just bought the cheapest one I could find even though it had very low ratings. Couple days later, and I've got dramatically cleaner windows. The magnets are strong and could smash your fingers if you're not careful, but following the instructions makes the easy enough to avoid. There are $40 options that may be better, but this worked well enough.",human

Great pump! So easy to use and has very strong suction features and modes. Love the fact that it’s made differently than other wearable pumps and it doesn’t make your boob look weird.

"I have small ear canals; thin foam earplugs are what I usually use.

"My husband and I both suffer from stomach issues, these are truly the best and purest probiotics we have found. We decided to try them since they are made in a GMP facility, our close friend a Scientist has informed us it is always better to purchase all supplements from this type of facility. The addition of these probiotics, taken at night on an empty stomach, keeps our digestive system healthy and we do not experience the painful symptoms we would otherwise have. Highly recommend these probiotics!",human
"I love love love these. They are so fun and work great. They are well-made and are quite secure. You have to pull fairly hard to get the two parts apart, which is nice because it does not slide off when you have weight in the bottom from the loose-leaf tea. It also grips the cupmug very well and stays put. One thing to note is that it is quite big, so you may have a small space to sip from, but it's still do-able. Another important thing to note is that the shark tail goes up fairly high on the mug, so once the water gets past the tail, you won't really get any infusing so you have to fill the mug up fairly high. However, that is also not a big deal (just something to be aware of). I love my two shark infusers so much, they are simply adorable and make me smile every time I use them (and they work really well)! :)*I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review*",human
"I have never been a fan or believer in Chinese herbs and medicines, however, when my service dog was diagnosed with an agressive cancer I was willing to try just about anything. I'm not sure how much this worked alone, but in combination with a few other herbal supplements it prolonged the life, and quality there of much longer than had I not given her these herbs. Out of the several brands I tried, this is my favorite because they are small hard gel ballscapsules which are much easier to get down. Because they are sealed they also don't smell or taste as bad as the other brands contained in the veggies capsules.",human
"I just received this item and I hadn't even tried it on, but I could tell from the feel of it I made an excellent choice. If you need a head strap for plastic frames that slide down your nose (as mine always do), get this product! It is even better than I had hoped: the strap is very lightweight, you won't even know you have it on. I wear behind-the-ear hearing aids -- the pieces that attach to my frames are very thin and pliable and fit nicely in my crowded ear space! The part that goes behind your head has a velcro fastener with the very cool company name on it. The strap sits low on my neck and is hardly noticeable, even with a shaved head. This strap is well worth your money and will do the job perfectly! The only available color is black -- I would have preferred some other -- but because of how well it works, I can easily overlook the matter. Order today!",human
Now signs of wear and tearing as Expected. Yes I got my money worth.THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE VALUE.,human
"LOVE IT! I've been using this for about a couple of months now and it has been working amazing. The craftsmanship is very solid and I expect this to last for many years to come.Pros: No shedding, solid handle, works up a great lather,soft feel, animal friendly (no animals killed in the making of this brush,) no plastic on the brush at all and the box that it comes in is recyclable.Con: Slight horse smell for the first 2-3 shaves. That doesn't bother me at all..i actually kinda like it. But for those who don't like smell of horse wash it a couple times and the slight smell will be gone.How I use it: I'm female so no beard to shave here. I use this when shaving my legs and arms pits.",human

"These do have a pretty green glitter to them. However, they have a very &#34;silicone&#34; feel to them, almost sticky even after they have been in the uv light. Don't get me wrong they are dry, they just feel weird. They also don't chip like many of the other uv polishes that I have. If these get caught on something or pushed on too hard they wrinkle up or start to peel. For me that just drives me nuts and I have to peel it off wherever it occurs. This is very annoying when I am out and about. I would rather it just have a small chip taken off of it, then snag and have some just flapping there.On the good side it does look very pretty. The sparkles are very bright and noticeable after just two coats. If you don't mind the &#34;non-slip&#34; type feel that these have then I'm sure they would work just fine. It may just be a pet peeve for me, but that is enough for me to say that the product is just okay. I think there are others that have a nicer sheen to them and a harder coat. It's just a shame, because the polish is pretty and there doesn't seem to be too many pretty greens out there.",human

"It's harder to use and slower than traditional curling iron. I'm a pro with the curling iron and this takes practice.  Curls arent as tight as I'd like...more loose curls even when following the directions. Smaller sections and pulling hair tight when pulling down helps...but doesnt glide nicely, and if you stop it makes a crease in your hair. Maybe with more practice I'll get better and will like it more but so far unimpressive, will prob go back to my curling iron. Does work as a straightener though.",human

They are durable, made of a think card stock, and the butter on the popcorn doesn't leak through.We used them on halloween night for just the 5 of us and we had a blast. We watch scary movies and ate popcorn out of them. Compared to the thin paper kind, these are much better.► I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",human

I think this product is great in several different ways it's got the velcro in the back which makes it so that you can adjust it I wish the adjustment wish the velcro was a little bit longer on each side that would make it to be able to just much better for smaller heads the eye part is perfect because it doesn't push on your eyeball like most masks push on your eyeballs and then you wake up and your eyes hurt in the morning so this I would recommend it to anybody who has to sleep during the day and wake up without puffy eyes the only thing that that was wrong with it was there's a small stretchy piece of material that goes from that goes over the nose Ridge and for people who actually have a nose unlike where this product comes from you have to cut the material because when the material is the way that they live they have it it doesn't mold to your nose it stretches over which then let's in a lot of light so just I just cut it that way it fits a nose that's a,human
"I originally ordered this as gift for my mother as a replacement for the “Wearable Nail Soaker Acrylic Polish Remover Tool” that melted as soon as the acetone touched it. I was hopefully that these would work but also worried history would repeat itself, but boy was I wrong. These are AMAZING at taking off gel polish and I am very well versed in gel polish removal methods. I have soaked, I have used cotton and tinfoil, the pre-done cotton pad and foil etc, and these are by far the BEST and EASIEST I have ever used.  I would HIGHLY recommend these for anyone who uses gel polish.",human

"I needed a reliable PSA (portable sound amplifier) and I didn't want to settle for cheap imitations.  I wanted to buy top of the line.  Finally I found this product; it had great reviews and the price of $229.00.  I didn't mind because I needed the best there was.  I followed the directions; kept it charged well and took good care of it.  Seven months after the purchase it still worked great and was strong enough for large audiences (over a hundred people).  However, a year after I bought it, it gave up on me in the middle of the performance.  The device was charged, the microphone worked (I tested it on someone else's device), but the sound coming out of the speaker was weak and distorted.  Nothing can bring it to back to life.  I took good care of it and always kept it in a safe dry place, out of the sun.  I always charged it the night before the event.  But it died exactly a year after I bought it.  It's too late to return it.  $229.00 down the drain.",human
Good for scrubbing your back and ideal for cleaning all parts of the body. Easy to clean. I would highly recommend.,human
"This filter has about 12 the pleats of prior filters I've used.  With fewer pleats there is less surface area for filtering so I suspect it will get dirtier sooner and I will have to change filters more frequently. Also, I have no idea how that affects performance. Maybe I should have looked at the picture more carefully because it is an adequate reflection of number of pleats though spacing it not as uniform. This filter was in a nondescript box with the filter itself covered in plain plastic.  There wasn't any info on manufacturer or Merv rating. Maybe contractors are their most likely consumer?  I would feel more comfortable being able to read about the product.",human

"These are well made readers, with the extra benefit of blue-light blocking. I've tried some other blue-light blocking regular glasses, but they had far too much yellow in the lenses, and made everything pale. These don't over-do it with the yellow, so they're much better on color accuracy. The readers are right-on. Nice they provide a good variety of powers, and they're not distorted like some cheap lenses are.

"This kit is pretty pricey but it also contains almost all you need for a solid detail. I used it on my Black BMW Z4 with the Zymol Lehm Klay III System to begin with. This kit has all yo need to make your car shine. I would recommend picking up some extra microfiber towels but that's it. Wax is the best you will use for the price, the Detail is great on the trim, and it has everything to detail the inside of your car. I would highly recommend. A professional detail with lesser quality product would cost about the same so if you have the time, you might as well do it yourself with a quality product. A professional detail with these products would cost twice as much as this kit.Worth every penny.",human
I liked that these stay in place better than disposable pads. They also are much more absorbant. I wash them by hand immediately after use. Soaking them for a few minutes can help.

"I am really excited to find a non-fish source of omega 3s! And in a gelatin-free gummy too! As a vegetarian, this is a huge discovery. I am bewildered at the reviewers who mention anything about a fishy taste or smell. This is an entirely plant-based product. It tastes like a fruity gummy vitamin. The only thing I would change is the quantity in the bottle. This may not make a difference to many consumers, but I bought this in conjunction with another WOW supplement. This bottle contains 30 servings, while the other product contains 50 servings. It would be far more convenient if the products contained the same number of servings so they are on the same refill schedule. Otherwise, I'm very enthusiastic about this new supplement discovery. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",human

"I got these for a baby shower where they just asked for diapers (it was their 2nd kid in quick succession, so they were all set with everything else).  The person I bought them for never said they leaked or the kid blew out the sides, so I'm gonna call that a win.",human

Product won't turn on.  The instructions don't indicate what type batteries to use.  It was very difficult to open and close the battery compartment.  Maybe batteries should be included.  Package was a little beat up.  Not gift presentable.  There is QC PASS tape on the package.  I guess QC doesn't mean Quality Control.,human

We like to return the customers vehicles better than when they dropped them off. So we wash windows, vacuum the floors and we thought wiping he dash down would be nice.

"I’m a huge fan of bath bombs and I have reviewed my fair share. It’s not hard for me to rank them highly because I genuinely enjoy them (regardless of brand). These are a different story. Right off the bat, from reading the back of the box, I saw they were made in China and not organic. The page says they are handmade with the freshest ingredients and organic. It also states they use essential oils. No where on the box do I see an essential oil listed as an ingredient.Once opening the box, the smell was STRONG. Very strong of perfume. Not like a fun minty smell, like cheap perfume. Additionally, there was a rolled up wrapper (see photo) and one bomb was completely missing. So I only got 15. I am not sure what happened to that bomb, but the piece of paper that held it was in there. Poor quality control.I wouldn’t purchase again.",human

These were terrible. As soon as I put them on my computer screen was blurry and I couldn't read anything.I thought there was plastic on the lenses that's how bad it was. If I put my face an inch or 2 from the screen I was then able to read but it looked like I was in a fish bowl. Definitely returned them.,human

Horrible quality. Looked sun bleached from the moment I took it out of the bag. Very dull printing. You can do much better than this sign.,human
I like them a lot The only down side is that they do not have the spring hinges. I knew that when I purchased them so I was expecting that to be the case but didn't realize how much I liked that feature until I didn't have it. Otherwise I like them a lot and they look great!,human

"On a recent trip to Cabo San Lucas I went to the Yhi Spa at ME Cabo for one of their treatments and there they served glasses of a very refreshing and unique chlorophyll tea which I loved. When I returned home I just had to order some for myself. When I perused the tea section of Amazon I was elated to see this type of tea was available and in anticipation of what I had in Cabo, I ordered it. This tea is palatable and actually tastes similar to cantaloupe rather than chlorophyll tea. I haven't consumed enough of it to experience the many benefits that drinking chlorophyll tea boasts. I probably won't buy it again because the price is quite high for 15 packets. I'll just go back to green tea and mint tea bagged water.",human

"While recuperating from Ankle Surgery.  This scooter allowed me to get out and about.  Very easy to use, stable and easy to transport.

Product is deceptively small. I thought for $11 there would be more. I should’ve read the fine print. Doesn’t really make a huge difference. When I have safety glasses in and a mask and come in from outside glasses still fog but not 100% more like 60%. I thought it would work better.,human

"UPDATED REVIEW (changed 3*'s to 5*'s):You need this item in your life. One day you too will eat some sketchy gas station bbq, and you will be sitting on the toilet, crying, praying, and probably wishing you'd just go ahead and die and get it over with. Even the good toilet tissue will feel like rough-grain sandpaper. At some point you will stop caring if you're actually clean or not, you'll just want to go back to bed, to die in peace. And then you'll remember that you bought this item, pull it out from under the sink, knock the cobwebs off, and use it. And you too will cry in relief. Pro tip: warm water to get you clean, then coolcold water for relief. You're welcome.---Ok, I'm not sure how to write a review about an item that sprays water up your butt, and not be totally gross, but I'm going to try.First of all, the big question: DOES IT WORK? Answer? Eh... Ish. If you lived through the great toilet tissue shortage of 2020, and you were hoping for an item that would completely replace the need for toilet tissue, you're going to be sorely disappointed. HOWEVER! It does greatly reduce the amount of toilet tissue that you'll need. Also, if you think that one bottle will be enough, you're going to be even more disappointed.I read a lot of reviews of people complaining about the air-hole at the bottom leaking. Either those people got defective bottles, or they've improved the design, because I don't even put a finger over the hole, and mine has never leaked a single drop of water. I did once accidentally knock the arm (with the sprayer head), back into the bottle, and ended up with water EVERYWHERE... soaked my shirt, the floor, pants, everything. At least it was warm water!My main issue is that it doesn't spray hard enough to actually get you clean. What I end up doing is use the bidet, then wipe, and repeat about 3 times, until the tissue is clean. I get pretty much the same results from using wet wipes, but at least the bidet is cheaper than wipes and tissue, and  doesn't clog the pipes like wipes do.Because of damaged nerves in my back, the motion of twisting around to wipe is incredibly painful for me, so I appreciate that I don't have to wipe as much. And it's convenient for me to use multiple times, because the sink is right next to me. So it works for what I need. Whether it works for you or not, you'll have to decide. Hope this was helpful. Y'all be blessed.",human
These feel like they have tiny steel balls that jab into your skin. I would not recommend these.,human
Great product but I can’t find these replacement heads anymore,human
"These clippers are not bad for the money but I would not consider them Professional quality. I bought them to use on dogs that don’t like the noise from my go to cordless clipper which is an Aesculap Durati (they power through any coat but they can be noisy at times depending on the blade)Right out of the box, these were quieter and they worked great on the first few dogs I groomed but after a few days in the salon, these clippers started to slow down and drag on the dog’s coats so I had to abandon them (the clipper blade was new and oiled regularly)They should work well for at home grooming on dogs that aren’t heavily matted and they are relatively quiet but I cannot recommend them for daily use in a professional salon as they wear out and slow down rather quickly.",human
Very small. doesn’t hold suction,human

"I love Under the Nile products and I thought this one was an excellent price for any liner but it is barely even a liner. I boiled it to soften it up but it is really scratchy, not very absorbent and very small. I used to use these as the end-of-the drawer, laundry day liners but they just aren't even worth the space they take up in the drawer. Now they are rags.Sorry, Under the Nile, most of your products are a hit but this one was way off the mark for me.",human
Does not stay in place. Waste of money. Do Not recommend,human

"This is a perfect little set to become familiar with this ethical and organic brand.It's even made in small batches, in order to ensure that you get a fresh product that hasn't been sitting around in some warehouse forever.The toner is refreshing, and preps your skin for the vitamin C serum. Both have a pleasing fragrance, especially the serum which is citrusy.Wonderful natural ingredients like berries and aloe vera.Afterwards, skin feels clean and not bogged down by chemicals. It even helped calm down a rosacea flare up.Skin care you can feel good about, in every way.",human
Always disappointed when you find out they lie about their size ... lol.  This is NOT 7 inches... more like 3.  This is definitely a mini massager.,human
Love the product however my dislike would be able to purchase it off here they want $25 for two Walmart carries this and you can get three for that price,human
"****WARNING*****  First off let me start by saying I never write reviews.  If something is substandard I just keep my opinion to myself but this is an extreme rip off and I want to warn you against spending a dime.  First off all the bling fell off mine during shipping, second I had to pay for shipping and the other 5 things I ordered on the same day shipped after this and beat it by a week.  It came a day after it was supposed to be here. The plastic is so thin that it only looks black in a dark room.  Any light hits it and it turns gray.  the little pimp tag on the bottom is a little piece of card board attached w a little plastic clothing tagzip tie.  So don't plan on keeping that on there unless you plan to never wash it which you probably won't be able to do anyway cause the rest of the remaining &#34;bling&#34; will come off.  This is basically not functional and not even good for a one night thing.  I bought this ready for a party tomorrow and now have no time to replace it.  Way to ruin a party!  It's a LIMP CUP not a Pimp Cup.",human
On a full charge you will get about 3 uses. Good product though,human
These things kind of suck.,human
"I've gotten a couple different types of xylitol tablets online, and found one kind (Xyloburst sours) that my toddler really liked-- then I later discovered that the 2nd ingredient is citric acid which is of course bad for teeth, so that seems to contradict the purpose of taking xylitol tablets. I finally bought these since there's such a limited selection here, whereas in other countries like Japan, products with xylitol are everywhere. Since it's being shipped from Japan it took about 2 weeks to get here, but my toddler really likes these--it has a pleasant peach flavor and it doesn't dissolve right away like the other tablets I've tried. The packaging and instructions are all in Japanese, but there's a lot to like about these-- they're sugarless and made for babies and toddlers, & there's roughly 0.4 grams of xylitol in each tablet, which is pretty much the same amount in most child-friendly xylitol tablets I've seen. I give my child about 3 of these a day, since she thinks they're candy but they're actually doing her teeth good. I thought these were a bit on the pricey side, but I guess it is about the same cost for any xylitol product in the US. Until I find something better closer to me, I'll continue getting these--maybe trying out some of the other flavor options as well.",human

"I had to write a review for these glasses. If you have small children who need glasses, then these are a must have! My son is 4. These glasses fit perfectly, and he throws them around.

Envision an Altoid smalls tin, but one and a half times as deep front to back.I purchased this case for assorted medications. Upon receipt, I immediately ditched the cheap plastic divider inside.

"OK look - its advertised as a flame less candle. So, thus,  I foolishly expected it to look a LITTLE bit like a CANDLE.Much like other reviewers have stated, the biggest issue I have with this is the electric plug. I cant even create the illusion of a candle with that thing attached.The look is bad, the cord is a bad idea, and it in no way resembles a candle so much as a badly lit lamp of some sort.At least the smell is good, when you stand really close to it.Do NOT buy this if you value your money. Check out the other - ANY other version by any other company that does not have a cord attached. At least then you can pretend its a candle instead of some lame lamp that doesn't even light the area around itself enough to find the on and off switch.",human

Serves the purpose.  Material could be a little better quality.,human
Bought these for our guest bathroom. They look nice and are sturdy.,human
These wraps stick to themselves no need for extra tape. There's alot in the box they do come in 2 colors and each roll is individual wrapped. Well worth the money. 6-14-2020,human

"You can always crumble your GGs, but you can't make this into crackers.  Just saying, I struggled to find reasons to use up the whole bag.  If you have reasons you want a lot of crumbles, this can be good, otherwise just buy the crackers and crumble when you need to.",human
"This is a good quality basic screen protector. I had a little bit of trouble getting it, with keeping bits of lint and hair off, getting no bubbles. Even with the cleaning cloth, sticky paper and alcohol pad. They helped, but I was still have difficulties. (I personally believe you should be able to clean your device and apply this type of item in one try, that is ideally how it SHOULD work.)I wish someone would develop a better way to apply screen protectors, so it is always even, no bubbles and completely free of debris.It does seem a little thick, but with my phone case on, you can't even tell.I have not been able to test it's stability. I will return if my results change.I do like the packaging it comes in, it is a nice little container to keep everything in, instead of out where things can get seperated from each other and lost.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",human

"I received this little gem yesterday and put it to the test last night.  After the first drink, it came back with no reading.  I was skeptical.  However, after the second drink it jumped up to 0.01.  I only had three drinks and it jumped to 0.03 after the third.  This will be a great little gadget to use at parties!",human
I thought I was getting what is pictured.  Just one block came and it took a long time to arrive.,human
I bought this for my mother-in-law as we like to give each other kooky kitchen gifts for Christmas.  She loves the thing.  It's not just a display thing for her.  She actually uses it regularly.  It does exactly as expected and her microwave to always clean.  She admits it's the best kitchen gadget I've ever given her.,human
Cannot get it to stick to wall. Was hoping it would not be so soft. Very flimsy,human

Works amazing I have hard to straighten hair and it's straighteb beautiful  and it's so soft silky and smooth definitely worth buying very satisfied with five stars,human
I bought this for facial pain and these are a super fit. I use flour sack clothes as a cover for these. They are super soft and the clothes provide a long length to wrap around my head to hold the cold pack in place. I have migraines and these make my life so much better! I'm glad I bought these.,human
"Received the product when expected, looked the way I expected it to and I really like it but the chain broke on it within a week and it broke off so short that cannot wear around ankle because the chain broke short, but could possibly wear as bracelet.",human
Rebuilt for engines using these they work out good so far,human
[[VIDEOID:95de89a23cef6550eb1fff74c68c222f]] Its more compact than I expected. It has a sleek and simple design. It’s not too loud. The clean up is pretty easy. You just make the top off and the rubber that catches the hair can be taken out and cleaned pretty easy. It has a side burn trimmer which is a bonus.,human

"I really like dryer balls. They shorten drying time and soften clothes. BUT these particular drying balls are the smallest I’ve ever had. I recommend you browse this site for other wool dryer balls and get some bigger ones. Also, these are imported and made of New Zealand wool, but there is no indication they were made there. I’m disappointed that information isn’t given. Four stars.",human
"Pleasantly surprised by these clips!  At first glance I thought they looked cheap and that the black part was just slipped over the white clip.  However after using these clips while doing my hair, my views quickly changed.  The clips firmly clasp the hair without tugging or pulling the hair.  I used multiple clips while doing my hair and I was able to move quickly through my hair because the clips were easy to remove and did not snag my hair like other clips. I give these clips five stars because I have very thick hair, and other clips that I’ve used in the past snap while holding my hair, but these stay put the first time.",human

When I forget to take it for a while, 1 tab a day, my hair starts falling out noticeably and my nails flake and tear so badly that I have to keep them clipped all the way to the skin.

Great.,human
Not a great fit. Beautiful patterns.,human
"With a stressful job, I thought I would try flower essences again, after dabbling in them many many years ago when I offered Rescue Remedy to animals.  I was super pleased to feel an absolute difference in my day.  I made a big jug of water for my 10-11 hr work day, and added several drops of each.  Whenever things start to get fraught, I take some sips, and feel so much better!! It is also encouraging more water consumption during the day which helps keep me grounded and more in touch with my intuition.  Wonderful!  Important to our clients (who are mostly 4-legged) and their people!",human
She loves it!,human

"Most local suppliers used to carry this brush.  The supply seems to have dried up, so I was glad to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price.  I prefer using these natural bristles to plastic ones, since natural bristles are gentler on skin. They also seem to last longer than plastic bristle brushes.  I will continue to order this item at this price, as needed.",human
"Used the beige color for a Pickleball  Basketball court in driveway… liked the results… it is noticeably cooler and doesn’t radiate as much heat as regular black driveway sealer… so, another plus when using for a recreational sports area.",human
"Very stylish, medium-sized. Frame not too ""heavy"" in feel or look. Very good progressive with zero magnification on top and I got 1.00 on bottom. Truly a quality frame and lens. Perfect post-cataract. Recommend for women. Good chic style.",human
"It has a good suction power, it worked good! I was able to see some blackheads come out. My skin got a bit red, which I think is normal because it is a little vacuum, I am planning to use it once per week.",human
The handles pop off very easily. They don't seal out water well. I only use these in the shower and they're poorly made.,human
It works as advertised,human
"Works great for vitamins, Rx's, and even cough medicine (you can throw away that cap on bottle after first use!). Cups are pliable - no hard edges, easy to help administer meds on a daily basis, easy to place meds in mouth. Will purchase again from seller.",human

nice and heavy,human
"a total fail, threw most of the bottle away.  Simply going for acupuncture was enough, no need to buy every herb they recommend.",human
Been using this for about 3 weeks. Hair definitely is coming in slower and lighter. It gets better after each 7 day cycle.,human
Good price,human
Never worked. Uncomfortable also. it was useless. SCAM,human
It’s made from silicone and has nothing inside to allow it to be easily inserted. The one I returned started to bulge on the side after two squeezes of the inflator bulb. Very poor quality. Don’t waste your money on this piece of junk!,human
Good for wavy hair and body. I was surprised I like it.,human
"Got these to lift a pair of plastic frame bifocals that I ordered online and hate to ask someone local to adjust.  They raised them up to the perfect height for reading.  I don't think they're very noticeable, and almost a year later, they're still stuck on.  I will admit that I don't wear that pair very much, but they have stayed on, even through cleanings.  They worked for my purpose, so I'm happy with them.",human
Not terribly excited about this product. A little too short and far too stiff,human
I spilled paint on a drop cloth & some leaked to the carpet.  This got the stain out but now there’s an oil spot there.,human
Absolutely garbage! I’ve only had these a few days and already they snapped in half. Very uncomfortable in your shoes no matter how you wear them and when you walk with shoes on while wearing these it sounds like you’re walking with boots on. I’m really disappointed to say the least and I never hardly write a bad review on anything I order. Hope to get my money back.,human

Love them and my car smells so wonderful,human
I honestly don’t know if these are working. I didn’t notice a difference. It might be cleaning ...it might just be a box with a light,human

"Like others have mentioned, it takes time for this type of product to work, ot to be able to evaluate to see if it works. I am test switching to this one because it seems to just contain collagens (variety) and not biotin products. My naturopath doesn't care for biotin hair, skin and nails products. I had been taking a powdered marine collagen, but stopped because the one I was taking was just too fishy smelling! (These capsules do not have too much of a smell.) I am wanting to try this, something different. I am sometimes losing hair, and my nails are brittle, so hopefully I can come back here in a month or so and report if anything has changed. My advice about this type of product is that you have to try and see what works best... we are all different, and these types of products work different on everyone as well. Hopefully a good review will be of help to the next person regarding collagen.",human
I ordered 3 and they all came in the same box wrapped together in plastic.  All 3 bottles had the same amount in them.  They were only half full.,human

"I am not convinced with the Brigham Rock Maple Pipe Filters. Maybe I draw to quickly, but I really don’t see much reduction in that dreaded gurgle when using them. They tend to get soaked fast and turn dark brown after just three bowls. I have tried smoking with and without them; I am leaning toward using without.",human
I never could figure out how to use them.,human
I have only tried a couple of the wands but they heat up very quickly and very hot. I ended up with an unfortunate hair cut and won't be able to use it for a while. 🙄,human

"This might make a good donut pillow for sitting on, but it's not shaped correctly for a sleeping pillow. The outer sides are so thick, my head just sort of hovered on top and couldn't reach the center portion. I think you would have to be at least 7 feet tall and have really broad shoulders for this pillow to fit properly under the neck.And it's so stiff! I tried to alter it by removing some of the batting, but the pillow shape was still too awkward. And I think there was enough batting inside to make 4 to 6 overstuffed throw pillows, so I'm going to repurpose it. The pillow fabric was really nice too, and sewn well.",human
"Not boho style, not as pictured. If you want rose and butterflies here you go.",human
They are difficult to install if you have big hands and the supplied screw drivers were difficult for my caregiver and impossible for me,human

Great kit for verifying your spectacle prescription.  Fun way to teach kids about optics.,human
"They're ok. Pleasant smell. My kids think they're fun. However, they are super slow to fizz. They just kind of sit there and dissolve. I'm assuming that's due to the fact that according to the box they're expired.",human
Compactor bags are sturdy and large enough,human
The battery compartment does not close and is not usable.,human

Quick delivery and boosted my energy level!,human
"AWESOME!!I used this to turn a tan soft top on a BMW Z4 to black. I did one 500ml bottle and it covered the whole thing, looks fine. I ordered another liter of each to make it super black.This product does the job VERY well, but I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend getting MORE than you think you need. Do two, three coats, you will appreciate it later.Would recommend to a friend.",human

"While YMMV, I found this unpleasant to use and very irritating to my sensitive teeth. I've tried others and had a similar problem but this was almost right out of the gate. The pen is harder to use than a tray or strips because it's hard to get into nooks and crannies but they generally do work. I just couldn't deal with the sensitivity. A hard no for me!",human
Pretty for wedding guests,human

"I have had several bottles throughout this past winter and have had great success fighting off colds before they start! I take this daily (1-2 pills) but when I start to feel cold coming on I ramp up to 3 pills a day. Has definitely reduced time a cold lasts. I also didnt get the flu this year (I usually get real sick for 3-4 days), and cant say that this product is the reason why, but I would still recommend for the winter months!",human
They are not universal. I tried to install them on my senior clippers and didn’t fit.,human

"These glasses are super cute and well made. However they are not as advertised. They do not have any blue light protection. I did several online tests and they did not hold up. There is also no yellow tint so even if the online tests were wrong I do not see how they could protect the eyes. I will be returning this product, but if you are not looking for protection and only want them for fashion purposes, I say go for it! They are comfortable and cute.",human
"So origionally I was Thrilled.  The packaging is beautiful and the scent is nice and earthy, smells very good, not ""perfumey'.  However, when applying it is VERY oily, which is a bit of a miss, and the scent is gone literally within the hour.  So unless you are reapplying all day Im not sure this is a keeper......",human

These are the best sweeteners in the world. They sweeten perfectly and come in a variety of conveniently sized containers. Nothing compares.,human
There is no claw as written in the description. It’s just 4 pick-up tools with magnets on the ends. No plunger to activate claw tool. Don’t buy it if you are looking for a claw.,human
Did not fit a 36 inch frame. Had to make a slit at one end for frame of dust mop to stick out.,human

"Darn it, I wasted my $$ for nothing. The suction is not enough to get my milk. If I go more than L4 it hurts even at L4 it’s uncomfortable for me. With my spectra I get 2 oz in 10,15 minutes (and that’s all I make which is not enough for my baby) with this I pumped for nearly 17 minutes I got 1 12 oz. and the worse thing happened when I tried to open it and pour milk into the bottle, the whole suction part came out resulting spilling all my milk.

The backside of the mask is basically the hook side of Velcro.  It's very scratchy and hard.  Making sleep very uncomfortable when it presses against your skin.  The foam loop that goes around your eyes easily falls off as well.,human
One Happy 6 Year Old!,human
I have 4 brakes in my humerus bone. Got surgery.  Now I’m out of my sling half the time so I thought maybe this would help hold my shoulder in place so that I could straighten out my arm more often. For my situation it’s not enough support. I certainly liked the concept though. Has a strong smell that needs out gassing as well. The company was great about refunding.,human
Great alternative soap.,human
Love this product for my mouth night guardretainer.  It is the best.,human

"The best of several wireless speakers with adjustable volume that I have tried. A second speaker allows two people to set the volume separately; headphones allow one person to listen without bothering the other. One important hint: before plugging in the headphones, be sure the speaker is turned off, then turn it back on; otherwise, the sound won't come through both earpieces, a fact not included in the instructions. (We discovered the solution to this quirk through trial and error, AFTER trying several different types of headphones, and even contacting technical support at the company.

It doesn't fit my husband's ankle the sides are for skinny legs not muscled ones (he doesn't work out just lots of walking on the job) it also doesn't fit my 11yo ankle which are the people I bought it for so it's just sitting on a shelf wasting space,human
This works,human
After my daughter in law had her twins she needed this badly. It had made such a big difference. She can use this twice a day to ease pain and discomfort. It's just as durable and has just as good quality as the ones the hospitals have. We looked at many of these even ones from the medical supplies companies and this one had the best price and looked more comfortable than the rest. Definitely glad we decided on this one. Great value.,human
The aroma is really great.  Have tried the spring time one and this is much better.,human
Def worth it.. and better than alot of whats Out there already.. just dont mix w saliva or semen or else it will get sticky,human
"I've purchased PillowPaws skid resistant socks before, in XXL (grey) and was very pleased.I decided to order a smaller size for my grandson but they didn't offer them in grey.I was disappointed in the quality of this order, though they are still comfy.I wear the 3 pair of irregular sizes and gave him the better 3 pairs.I won't order from this vendor again.",human
"These are very compact and great to have in my pocket when I go shopping, but at home I've got better reading glasses to use.The three-pack comes with the glasses in nice cases that close well.  The package also includes three cleaning cloths.The glasses are VERY small and, at least for me, best use for short time periods.  I use them primarily while shopping as they are helpful for reading ingredients and I keep a pair in the kitchen to read labels as well.  If I'm going to wear reading glasses to read a book or newspaper, I feel more comfortable with larger glasses that do a better job of staying on - these have short arms and don't do the best job of staying on if I am moving about.Overall, they function pretty well, but for short term use.",human
I dont have anything bad to say. My teeth and gum feel clean after use.,human
"I'm sure this would work if I could stomach it. The taste alone is so horrid I ended up mixing it with some other flavors to get it palatable.. which didn't work. The thought of the taste makes me gag... yes, it's that bad for me.Two stars for not adding a bunch of crap, but minus 3 stars because I'm going to throw it away since the taste makes me gag.",human
"Updated:At first I really liked these sleep masks. I had to make a small adjustment, but they seemed to work well so I gave them four stars. Well, now that I have used it for a while, the red sleep mask leaves black marks from the strap all over my sheets. The black dye will not wash all the way out, so I have ruined a nice set of sheets. I don't know if this is the case with all the masks from this company or just mine. So beware when you purchase.These sleep masks are pretty good, especially for the price. You get two masks, two sets of foam ear plugs (which I don't use), and a carrying case. I really like that these are contoured over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyelid. The only reason they didn't get five stars is the nosepiece. I found it to be a little too wide. I had to perform minor surgery and cut out a small v-shaped piece of material from the nosepiece in order to make the mask block out more light from the bottom and take pressure off the bridge of my nose. Now they work great, but I probably decreased the lifespan of the masks. But for the price, I don't think that will be problem Time will tell.",human
Put them in my boots and walked around Manhattan- awesome,human

Great price and working as expected.,human
This was not even sewn. It was pressed out of a sheet of fabric that felt like wearable rubber. Hard to breathe. I would not recommend,human
Well made. Pages are decently thick. I actually ordered 2 of these and they are great.,human
Really disappointed in these items.  Can't tell one bit of difference in how I feel.  Very expensive lesson.,human
Does exactly what it's marketed for! Nice light smell,human
"I like the fact that this is a SPF 30 lip balm, the main reason I purchased it!  The texture is smooth and glides on easily without being greasy or slick, perfect.  It's not thick, heavy, or ""grainy"" either, just the right consistency.  Very nice flavor without being overpowering or lingering too long!  I can easily suggest it for both men and women since it's not a shiny gloss!  It stays on for quite a while but if I do need to reapply I purchased the 24 pack (GREAT DEAL...only $1.00 per tube), so...I can do that freely, at will and as the mood strikes me with all I have to use...ha ha ha!  Very happy with my purchase, will purchase again when needed.",human
Works as it says,human
"I like this shoe inserts, supper comfortble.",human

"I have problems with my liver and gallbladder... It seems to wake me up a lot at night, especially around 3:00 AM.I have taken NAC off and on before, but had no idea it would help me sleep.  I actually started taking it to improve my immune function.. it was a nice surprise that it helped me sleep at night.The taste isn't great but I don't care about that, all I care is that it is helping my health and especially my sleep.",human
My son is 3 months old and we have been using these liners since birth. They are great and he is a very heavy wetter. They are so soft and snap into any cover. We have been using ramparooz covers more often and those don't have a snap but these liners stay in place.,human

Amazing hair dryer. It dries hair very quick. Perfect for traveling. I like it so much that I am buying another for everyday use.,human
"Gummy candy that is good for you?  Yes!  I have given these gummies to my kids and they love them.  I was worried the ""elderberry"" might be too grown up of a taste, but they really are just an interesting berry flavor. They taste great, my kids and I both agree.  They are definitely sweet, sugar coated, and more like candy than some other gummy vitamins, but, we don't mind :). They have a nice chew, and were not stuck together in the jar.My kids have not gotten sick since they started taking these gummies, which may be coincidence, or may be due to the immune boost, either way, it has been great to have everyone healthy, and we'll keep taking our daily candy :)",human
I really wanted to love this but had to return it after the 2nd. use. What a waste of my money.,human
I spray a few sprays directly into the hvac intake and the entire house smells great for a long time.,human
"12242019 UPDATE: After just 10 minutes of using this gamma brainwave entrainment device, my tinnitus (which I have had for years, but which has never been a bother) was amplified ten fold to the point where it is distressing and headache inducing and has already prevented me from sleeping a night.  The product comes with disclaimers warning against seizures for those who are prone (I am not), but there is no warning about tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and so I feel compelled to issue one here should anyone else be subject to this symptom.  I'm worried enough about it that I've already booked an appointment with a neurologist to get a brain map done in hopes of finding a countervailing frequency that can remedy this awful ringing in my head.  I noticed this effect almost immediately and should have heeded it; should this happen to you, do yourself a favor and discontinue use at once!On top of this, the charging cable has a short in it and the unit cannot be reliably charged, so I am returning it based on this alone.  If only that were my only issue!  Be forewarned.------------------------------Original Review:I suppose this does what it says it will do: it plays an audible tone (maybe 1khz?) pulsing at 40 cycles per second.  It looks like a tiny (one inch square) ipod player, replete with standard headphone jack, usb micro port, and a mini SD card.  For some reason, they include ear buds with the unit; I'd have preferred they saved the money on the buds (which are common enough) and spent a bit more on the quality of the unit.  I'm tempted to see if I can transfer whatever audio file is on the SD card to my phone.  Or just download a binaural brain app that will play the same cycles... but typically, a gamma wave of 40 hz is inaudible.  I'm assuming the 1khz tone cycled 40 times per second matches what was performed in the gamma wave entrainment studies.I plan to use this nightly along with the 40hz lights to see if it has any noticeable affect on my cognitive state.  Time will tell.",human

"I have been using the product for 3-4 months now, wish I had found them sooner, I am active,i do martial arts, that's when things start acting up. but this does the trick, it doesn't hold a lot so you might want to have one handy, also like the other reviews they can make you sore from the elastic so use some lotion (something) first, that helps........but as you can see I gave it 4 starts..BUT... they jumped the price by $5 in 1 month so they get 3 starts other than that they have been helpful in regaining my confidence and self-esteem",human

I was excited to find a low noise small trimmer to trim my Yorkie’s paw pads and around his face.  My clippers are too large and I dislike using scissors.The trimmer fits in between his paw pads and is also capable of trimming the hair inside his ears. I immediately charged it. The instructions indicated that a full charge takes 5 hours but after 12 hours on the charger the charging indicator light was still red. I can’t understand why the manufacturer decided to use a USB charger for clippers instead of the regular plug in charger that most dog clippers use.I decided to give it a quick test on my dog’s paw pad. I can’t imagine using this for actual grooming because it only cut a small amount of hair before the trimmer blade had to be cleaned to remove bits of hair. No professional would use this because it would take them all day to trim one paw.While I like the concept this trimmer is a total waste of money. I will replace this trimmer but have decided to go with a different brand.,human

"This is a small heating pad, 12 inches wide and 24 inches long. The box calls this an extra large, and I disagree with that. However, it's big enough to work quite well on my neck, shoulders (heating one at a time), the small of my back, or my abdomen. This pad heats up very quickly, and the heat levels are 1-6. There is also a timer function, offering 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min. When the heating pad is on, the LED display constantly goes back and forth between showing the current heat setting and showing the amount left on the timer, which I like. The control is super easy to use, with one button for turning the pad on and off, one for selecting the temperature level, and one for selecting the timer setting. The material is soft and plush, and feels very comfortable on my skin. I am pleased with both the looks and the function of this heating pad, and am glad I ordered it.",human
I’ve tried other brands and this one is the best. The bristles are not too long where the plate will slip or food can get stuck. Also the size is perfect for me. Not that big. Also I appreciate how the water temperature doesn’t effect me when I wear them!,human

"I like that in a pinch if I'm getting low on tubes and don't have time to travel nearby to get more, I can just order them online.  Also, it tends to be a large quantity for a fair price given the convenience.  They come sealed appropriately.  Periodically some of the tubes are crushed upon opening the box, but usually not so much that they're unusable, just gently smoothing them out with your finger does the trick.  It hasn't made me feel that this is a product to shy away from.  When actually smoking these, you get what you expect, no surprises.",human

I am in a better mood in general, like I don't get stressedfrustrated as easily with daily stuff. I get more restfulquality sleep.Cons:I don't really notice a boost or change in my libido. if you stop taking it for more than a week or so, your T-levels take a dip and slow to recover on it's own. The manufacturer recommends 1-month on and 1-month off cycles.Overall, decent product. I'm on my 3rd bottle.",human

I wouldnt be surprised if im paying to give myself some disease or deficiency because the animals were raised in crappy conditions.  Either way, theres nothing spectacular about this product.  Its simplly BCAAs, no flavor, no other additives.  I like it because i can add flacor to it myself, most other brands are just loaded with sugar.  This just happened to ne the cheapest one when i shopping for it.  Theres no brand loyalty here, same for drestine mono.  Doesnt matter what brand, its pretty much all the same.

"I love these things!  I've been using them for 14 years now and they are my &#34;go-to&#34; when it comes to pluckingshaping my eyebrows.The most important thing to note is that you must wash your face shortly before you use them.  Make sure your eyebrows are dry enough before you apply.  If you don't wash your face, the oils will prevent a proper hold for the adhesive to stick to and you won't have removed any strays.  Trust me, if you do wash your face first, you will not be disappointed in this product.  I love how short of a time it takes compared to plucking.",human

When I first put them in it was a bit uncomfortable I was going to return them. What I wanted was some padding. By the time I got the padding my footwear was no longer bothering me at all.

I am size 8 12 usually but my feet seem to shrink in the colder months so I keep slipping out of some of my shoes.  I cut them to fit into the back of my shoes and it works really well.  The material is a soft, slightly textured somewhat rubberized type that is comfortable and has enough grip to it to keep my heels from sliding around and causing blisters.

The shower bench is really nice and sturdy. I got it for my mother. I could've given it 5 stars but I give it a 4 because the tray didn't fit. I didn't want to go through all the hassle of returning the bench for an exchange for a fitting tray. It also came slightly chipped on one corner but not that noticeable. Delivered already assembled is a big plus. I hope in the future the sales people can make sure the tray measurements are accurate before shipping it to their customers. My mother is happy with it that's what matters. Thank you :-),human
"I bought this product on a cruise ship and love it. It smells fresh, it is very light and doesn't make the hair greasy and it protects the hair from drying out. I use it with a hot curling iron brush as my hair is curly. It makes it smooth and look lush.",human
It has helped me with urinary tract problems.,human
Works as expected.,human
"Good stuff!I'm not so keen on all the whey products that spike your AA levels and then fall off quickly, so Phase8 was perfect for me. It's also the best-tasting out of similar products I've tried from Muscle Milk (UGH), EAS, API, and Max Muscle.Unfortunately Amazon is running out of stock, Muscletech might have abandoned this product to focus on others with all kinds of silly extras.",human
Everything is what I expected. Fair price for the amount of product received.,human
They work okay,human
Great Product !!,human
These clippers are a strong sturdy and sharp but they’re a little tight to use I don’t have a lot of strength in my hands,human

"I have tried other products that seemed to tout the same results, but with limited success. I took one of these (in full blown party-drinking mode) and was MORE than ready to handle my business. Finally went to sleep after an hour of mind blowing sex. At least that was the term that she used......I would definitely recommend.Oh, and the effects seemed to last for a while.  My libido was through the roof for at least a few days.",human
"I have to give my pet daily meds in liquid form.  The plastic plungers the vet was giving me would stop gliding smoothly regardless of washing and the measurement lines would wash off.  It was well worth it for me to buy these glass syringes which are easy to clean and work every time. It's easy to fit the small tip into my cat's mouth and quickly dispense her meds.  The only thing I would point out is that these are very short (I suppose due to the small doses this is for).  So if you buy these for the same purpose, I would suggest buying a wide mouth short glass leakproof jar that you can get this small syringe into when extracting meds.",human
"I tried this out of the box and like others have said it does nothing. It needs open pores so best to try it out of the shower or steam your face before hand.That being said I did try it out of the shower too and still didn’t see that it was doing anything except irritating my skin. I kept it moving and did not pause on any part of my face, but I still feel like it left Red splotchy spots all over my face when done, and I didn’t notice a decrease in my black heads.I don’t think I’ll be using it again as it seems to do more harm then good. It comes with four different styles of the head piece. I didn’t notice a difference in the way any of them functioned.",human
very basic but serves it's purpose.  I keep it in the shower and I haven't had any issues with rust.,human
Placed this in a low airflow side of my apartment not far from the front door. I can tell it helps to keep the pollen and dust down. I don't have to dust my black glass furniture near as often as before.,human
"Great bulbs, great experience. I will buy from again.",human
"This is a good product for a smaller person or someone without broad shoulders.  The straps are kind of short and because of the design of the product can be very difficult to close.  This is not the product, in the present state,  for someone with shoulder or neck problems because of the way that the posture aid  fits.  I can see the potential of the product if changes are made.  I suggest that it be designed in different sizes to fit to the different body types.  This is a one size fits all product and it could be a great benefit if it was adjusted into sizes for the different body types.  I got this product at a discount and even though it is not a good fit for me, I would recommend it to a smaller person.  I would love to try the larger size product if it is ever produced and get the true benefit from it.",human
"Love it, I have used before.",human
This serum has such an overpowering smell of essential oils. It's also very oily and doesn't absorb well. I'm returning it.,human

I am always on the lookout for some good mangesium powders.  I use them at night before I go to sleep.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a glass jar and is well packed.FULL?The jar in the photo was taken after I only took two scoops of product.  The fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is.  It really should be a bit fuller than it was.EASY TO TAKE?This is not difficult to take.  It is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink it.FLAVOR?I did not find the flavor offensive.  Some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag.  This one was not like that for me at all.  It is actually pleasant to take uncluttered with sweetners.DOES IT HELPThis is really helpful to relax me at night.THE BOTTOM LINEThis powder is pleasant to take.  It is not cluttered with stevia or other additives.MY RATINGFIVE STARS. I am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added.  I only wish it was a little fuller.,human
My wife liked them ok.,human
"Kids LOVE these straws because not only are they STRAWS, but they're STRIPED. Not sure why this matters, but it seemed to strike them as fun and special. Great substitute for the plastic version, they last fine for a drink or two, so no complaints there at all.",human
Absolutely love these lashes. Perfect for everyday wear and easy to put on.,human
"Just what I wanted. Long enough to let my reading glasses hang at the right length and slip on and off over my head without binding. The rubber loops that install on the temple pieces are easily adjustable, unlike the Croakies I had.",human

Uncomfortable in shoes!,human
Not the solution for gravelly throat I hoped it would be.,human
Good but not what I needed.,human
Bought these for my 18 month old. She is in size 5 shoe now. I would say ideal for 12-24 months depending on your child's size. They come up and stay up. Like two layers. The bottom in thicker and they kept her feet warm in the Bavarian alps. Really liked thread.,human
It ripped after a couple of weeks,human
I’m so glad I bought these! I put my mask on and off throughout my day and now I don’t forget it because I’m “wearing” it. It’s perfect for me.,human

"When I heard about my parents' last set of good readers biting the dust.. I picked this set to get to them.  They arrived right away and they had no complaints about them. That means they're great or I'd have known if literally any little thing wasn't up to task.  Good lenses, undistorted performance and the spring hinges make for a great solution for them. I may even get myself some next time I need to replace mine.",human

Great item for the pricePrice.,human
"I just wish they would stop this one size fits all stuff. I like that you can put it from one hand on the other which is great since this way you can get one if you only have occasional pain in one hand or the other. It fits quite well and works well too providing support and pain relief.The biggest problem, it is quite snug and I wish it was a bit bigger. Not everyone's wrist is the same size and the strap that wraps around the wrist either needs to be longer or they need to have different sizes. Other than that this is great.",human
Excellent value.  Great tasting product.,human

"It’s almost mid November here in New England, time I would prefer to not be shaving. I was complaining to a friend about shaving bc it’s been in the 70’s the past few weeks and she told me about this product. I could not wait for it to come. It arrived right when it said it would. I did not follow the instructions and shower first I just went to it. I had both legs completely smooth in under 15 minutes. No burning or adverse affects. I had doubts but this is amazing. I’m getting everyone I know one for Christmas",human
Working as expected. Excellent.,human

"The medical alert wristband was just as described. It is a third party item. It took longer than two days, but it came a long time before it was promised. It is a silicone bracelet in white with red medical alert symbol and blue writing. It is large enough to fit over a medium sized wrist. If you need more than two and or you need a custom wristband, the URL for the manufacturer is on the inside of the wristband in raised letters. I have had this item for less than a week, but I've worn another wristband made by another manufacturer for over three years (it was discontinued) and this silicon wristband will not inhibit you.",human
My daughter loved it!,human

"I have been getting allergy injections for years. I'm allergic to my cats, dust mites, mold, and every tree and grass that grows in my area. The injections have helped, but when the pollen count is high, I take these. They aren't miracle workers for me, but they do help. My local natural grocer sells them under their own label, but these are the exact same product and are a few dollars less.",human
"I also pack a couple of these aluminum bottles in my bag during a long dirtbike practice session.  Not only have I noticed I am nowhere near as sore the next day, but as the previous reviewer stated, it keeps your body going much better than Gatorade.  Unlike Muscle Milk, it does not leave your mouth with that ""chalky"" aftertaste for a while.  I really hope the company is successful with this brand because it is one of the best protein drinks I have ever had.  Way to go Attitude Drinks!",human

I love these heel socks so much.  They have helped with my heels so much.  I wear them to bed every other night and I can’t believe the difference!!,human
The heating oil and its aroma is excellent. But the price is high and the bottle is small so I use it sparingly. Non staining Tiger Balm is still my favorite for its value.,human

"I will be buying more once this is out.It is like sugar putty. Mine is hard to squeeze out. I wonder if it is supposed to be that difficult, I'll see when I get my next tube!I do like putting bows or felt flowers on my little girl who has so little hair. I can be sure she won't brush it off. Taking it off appears to be a little like taking duct tape off skin, it takes a bit of a tug, but washes off so easily.I tried the earrings and they stuck, but not as well, but on a nursing two month old the ears get brushed at and rubbed a lot. I will hang on to those and start using them when she can sit up.",human
"Purchased this for work as we needed it for ADA purposes.  A co-worker put it together with ease however no wheels were included.

All about safety in the work place and lifting is frowned upon.",human

"I am impressed with the quality of this order.  The extra length on the back scrubber makes it really easy to use.  I bought it for the back scrubber, but all the pieces work great.  I took off a point because I would have liked the ""bristles"" to be a little stiffer. but all in all, it does a great job.",human
The battle brick figures were excellent.  It arrived just as advertised. Works with standard lego minifigs. My son loved them.,human
Arrived with bent corners and not explanation as to how to sting them together. I referenced the picture but I was at work and had to go outside to get a signal and screenshot the photo to go inside and piece the together for the office. (No signal inside). The material is flimsy so if you’re saving them for use next year You’ll need to store them in something sturdy,human

"I had high hopes for this bunion corrector.  I did not review it immediately because I wanted to see how well it performed over time.  It is easy enough to use and seems to be well made.  I have now used it for about a year, daily, without fail.  I can see no change at all in my bunion.  A year should be plenty of time to see at least some progress, but I have seen none at all.  I finally gave up.",human

"Forget about these powders....the only thing they are good for is washing your floors and other household chores.  As a shampoo....they dry your hair and leave reddish residue in your hair; I used another as a toothpaste and it was so strong that it broke the enamel on my tooth and my tooth broke, right up to the root; now I have to spend thousands of dollars on a tooth cap.  I will never buy any of these reddish powders again; oh, and they leave a color deposit in your hair as well.",human

"I found that these take a little while to adjust to. There a some nice advantages - lightweight, positioned OVER eyes (not on them) so you don't sweat beneath and you can move your eyelids, easily adjustable strap. The vent also helps keep it cooler. For some reason, though, I'm fidgety when I first put them on, taking a while adjusting them on my face each night. I also don't find the piece of fabric on the nose comfortable, so I cut that off.",human
"I put mouth wash in it, it works very well",human
These have helped my ears SO MUCH!  I wear glasses and between them and mask ear loops my ears can get very sore very quickly.  I can't begin to tell you how much these have helped!,human
"I bought this as I was looking for something without nasty chemicals. I am very very clean and like to freshen my bed linen before sleeping. This was a disaster. After a week, my whole place had this stinking smell which just wouldn't go! When I spray, it seemed ok right then, not great mind you, but okay - but then after a couple hours, the smell goes rotten! Then I finally traced it to this. After a month, there is still residual smell from this crap - I've washed my sheets, steamed mattress and duvet, but still a very nasty after smell remains. I bought two of them and dumped them both. Worst freshener I've come across so far",human
I expected better from the reviews. Really doesn't do much unless your hairs are so short you can barely see them anyway,human

"“WOWOW!! You know, I didn't know these existed when I started my search. I saw the Febreeze car air fresheners, and thought that it would clip to the little tower fan in my small room, but because the fins are vertical, not horizontal, the liquid ran out, all over everyyhinh! I started searching for a clip style Air freshener that could clip to a vertical fin, and when I saw that it used a pad instead of a reservoir of liquid, I know I had found &#34;the one&#34;. It had the clip that I needed, and it didn't have an &#34;UP&#34;, so nothing could leak out of it if clipped on sideways.&#34; When I received it, I clipped it to to the fan, and turned the fan on to make sure it worked...and IT DOES!! I AM so happy... now all I need to do is find just the right scent! Thank you, KOKO AROMA!!! It's Perfect!!!!!!!!!",human
Great for pain relief. Harder then tennis balls .,human
"For full disclosure, I must state that we used this pot 24 hours a day7 days a week. It was rarely unplugged.  For the first two years, this unit was awesome. It provided piping hot water without the need for a ""cozy"" to keep the unit insulated.  However, after two years, the manual pump function began failing. Each push on the pump only provided an ounce or so. Finally, I ordered a new gasket (the manual says it needs to be replaced once a year) for about $13... and nothing improved.  In taking apart the lid to replace the gasket, I saw there was some plastic that had become very brittle and broken, and a smell of burning plastic... while the electric pump feature is still fine, the manual pump is pretty much dead...",human

"The headgear sent is not real respironics headgear. It is a generic knock off made of inferior quality materials. The fabric is much thinner and does not stretch any to assist with taking the mask on and off. The headgear also did not come with the magnetic clips.

It has a lovely silky feel and a little while after you apply it, it feels very light weight- like it almost melts into your skin, but it tends to break me out a little- just a little, but I don't like that. It's too bad PX discontinued this line, I'd probably buy more if they had more colors to choose from.",human
