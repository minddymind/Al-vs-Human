i have nasal issues and like my mother boxes of tissue in every room and car  i dont have cup holders in my car but these would work perfectly there  they are not super soft and thick but not thin and rough either so theyre fine  my only recommendation is to look at the diagram on amazon on how to open it up i didnt and ripped off the top i taped it back together tougher and the canister works great one coming out after one is pulled up and out very easily
works great since they do you might ask yourself why do you need five case is great

the bath bombs all look and smell the same they are fairly largeabout the size of medium oranges not gift quality imo as the box doesnt scream luxuryrather it says utility plus it has a wide plastic wrap around it theres a bar code label firmly stuck on the box which says made in china i was unable to remove it without tearing the box so again an argument against giftingthe bombs are individually wrapped and are strong smelling just all the same which is a great pity there is a tiny variation in colour due to to the swirls but thats itbath bombs have become fancy these days and so these dont compare well they fizzed and floated for a while and kids love that but other than that nothing special overall the smell was too strong

one tabet is supposed to last 30 days not true 1 tab lasts 2 weeks i live alone and have marked the calendar to make sure i was correct disappointing
they smell amazing however you would probably need 20 of them to be able to consistently smell them here and there it will be noticeable but its amazing when it is
this product is amazing and i wouldnt be without it now

i have been taking carnitine capsules to help with fibro pain  lets see how these workedhow these comethese come in an orange plastic bottle with an orange childproof cap  the pills inside are pressed white powderare they hard to swallowthese tablets are a bit on the long side but they are not too big to swallow if you are sure to have a lot of water in your mouthany bad reactionsi have not had any burping or bad digestive reactions to thesedo they helpi find that taking these does help with fibro pain and energy about as well as the powder in gel caps that i normally take  they do help take a bit of the edge off of the painthe bottom linethese tablets are not the same as the powder in capsules i usually take but they seem to work as well to help with fibro pain and energy levels  the orange bottle is great to help me find it quicklymy ratingfive stars  i am glad that i got these  i was not sure when i first saw them but after taking them i think they work pretty well

ive been taking lions mane mushroom powder for about 2 months solid and find that it has basically no flavor at all i put it in my coffee or a turmeric tea it mixes in well and its easy to drink ive done a some research on it and it seems to be a very good supplement and highly beneficial for good health here are some the benefits it has enhanced brain functioning ability to prevent or slow the growth of cancer supports heart health helps with depression and anxiety potent antioxidant reduces inflammation boosts immune system supports digestive healththe only side effect ive been able to find is that it might cause a slight skin rash with some minor itching but is very rare and not considered serious just irritating i think this is a very good lions mane supplement
i love this scale very much it syncs right away with my phone and fitbit app the only funny thing is i have to weigh 3 times to get a very accurate reading well worth it to me my daughter uses it also and i love how you can choose the initials of the person so it syncs to the right person i love it the batteries that came with it had a very short shelf life so be prepared to replace them right away the new batteries are going strong i also noticed it doesnt like really cold floors not sure why but that is what it seems like to me
healthy soyfree dairyfree protein awesome i use it in mealreplacement shakes with cocoa powder a little sugar and sometimes peanut butter powder or powdered heavy cream and the price is better than i expected

i did not expect them to be of such nice quality i bought about 40 of them in total to give as gifts to those who take my face fitness class
as you would expect works great for stirring
these are listed as one size fits most my thoughts on that were that that meant fits a lot of different sizes not i wear a 14 and there way no way these were going on i gave them to my oldest daughter who wears an 8 and they barely fit not only were they difficult for her to get on in the first place they kept sliding down over time the waistband doesnt hold them up very good and with the thighs being so extremely tight they kept wanting to work their way down to be fair they seem nice and warm however i wouldnt recommend these for anyone over a size 8 at max or probably under a size 6 maybe a 4  not my idea of one size fits most1 star  awful want my money back2 stars  bad but not horrendous3 stars  decentgood4 stars  really good5 stars  excellent definitely recommend
i really like the quality of these gua sha pink stones from this particular company its polished and smooth and i havent received a nicked or damaged one yet it feels great after youve left it overnight in the fridge overall i like the presentation and quality very much recommended

very comfortable and for the ridiculously low price not falling apart after a month or twoi will easily by more of these when i do break ones i have or wife takes themcome with slim cases and glass retainer cordsalmost 5 star really for the price and quality so far but i reserve 5 star for perfect items 
this is a nice basket of bath bombs the basket itself is a decent quality the bath bombs are a little smaller than i expected but they seem to explode slowly so you can relish the experience for a moment or two the bombs are individually wrapped in plastic which has been a little difficult to open the first bomb that i used said it was grapefruit but didnt smell anything like the fruit it had more of a flowery perfume scent the next one that i used was the peppermint one and it did smell like peppermint so i dont know if the grapefruit one was mislabeled or not the bombs havent left any noticeable rings in the tub this would make a great gift
excellent these are lasting well over a year the battery life is phenomenal 7heads is the best configuration for inshower bald facepate shaving7heads are excellent every bit the equal of my 5x more expensive foil shaveras a note i used a shaving creamconditioner provided by the hotel on the road some months ago and not this shaver the hotel cream was too thick and stalled the razor it was a bear to cleanout it was the first time i ever had to pop the individual shaving heads  id suggest you avoid this if you have big hands since then ive stuck to my tried and true shaving cream that enables a close shave and easy flush cream
this is a nice idea and concept but the execution doesnt work for many faces this ended up putting a lot of pressure on the bridge of my nose which isnt particularly huge or anything but this definitely is made for people with tiny noses with a very small or low bridge if thats not you youre not gonna like this very uncomfortable and the little hook bracket things dont connect to anything so they dont stay in place
love this shoe horn  im short with a bad spine  the reach is totally adjustable works great
this was my first time trying chlorella powder and it will likely be my last the smell alone turned my stomach i tried to drink it but the flavor is strong i felt like i was drinking dirty water frogs had been splashing around in im sure the green color added to that mental picture the powder is super powdery so be careful opening the package i used an immersion blender to get it mixed up it seems like a nice product if you like the taste and scent im unable to bear it though
this is a fantastic set of blends for essential oil newbies i have been dabbling in essential oils for aromatherapy application and cleaning purposes for a almost a year now and ive been pleasantly surprised with how much i like them im a big fan of diffusing them to help with quotailmentsquot and i think this set of blends is an amazing deal for a great setwhat i like1 this includes all of the most common oil blends that you can make if you have all of the individual oils stress relief sleepytime headache remedy breathe better health shield immune booster and muscle relief there are lots of mixtures you can do depending on the issue you are addressing but these have been the most common other than muscle relief that we have used in our house2 the sizes of the bottles are great its more than enough to last you a while as you only need a few drops in your diffuser3 they are already premixed in the correct amounts no guesswork no worrying if you have enough of one oil or not enough of another and you can always add a couple more drops of whatever you want to make this more customizable  if you want to add slightly more eucalyptus or peppermint to the diffuser when you use quotbreathequot for instance4 dark amber glass bottles and heavy duty caps to keep the oils safe5 comes in a really nice box so this would be perfect to give as a giftwhat i dont likei honestly havent come across anything yet all of the ones ive tried have been helpful and they smell exactly like the blends i had been doingoverall im glad i gave this set a try and i will definitely be buying my mother a set since shes just starting out with essential oils i think this set is super convenient and well priced for what you get im very happy with iti did receive this item for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing it but my cost has no bearing on how i rate a product
started using march 25 2015 so dont know how it is working yet
i love these aromatic steamer shower bombs they are vividly colored appropriately sized delightfully scented and affordably priced and they always provide an invigorating shower experience each disk comes individually wrapped and the entire set is attractively packaged but i will say that any other scented products i use at the same time as these overpower the fragrant scent of these bombs simply because body washes and shampoos are closer to my nose the air is scented strongly for up to about 3 feet above each bomb and they dissolve cleanly without staining surfaces so id still recommend this boxed dozen to others
my husband is very pleased with this trimmer the price was what helped him decide to give this a try he loves a good deal he recommends this beard trimmer
arrived on time item as described
great trimmer that worked well in shower i still prefer a razor blade for a much closer shave
comfortable fit but not much help with sweating under the mask
i was pleased at first but now i am not  no matter how long i leave my contacts in my eyes burn from this solution  even after i rinsed my lenses with saline solution they still burned my eyes  so i stopped using this and went back to bausch and lomb bio true lens solution
first floss ive found that glides easily between my tightlyspaced teeth  im very happy with this product
works great as advertised
very nice cant wait to finish my current journal to get to use this one
if you have a husband who snores and keeps you awake at night i would suggest you buy these i dont know how i have lived so long without these
i cant take a lot of supplements due to the ingredients which end up doing more harm than good i took these and taking these and have had zero problems as for benefits i cant say that ive noted any unlike pqqresveratrol has many health benefits and i was happy to give it a try we are all different perhaps others noticed a differencethis is made in the usa and gmp certified i always look for that this is a vegan capsule which is great i dont get the addition of lemongrass but perhaps im missing somethingthere are 60 capsules here but the recommended dose is 2 per day so in reality this is a 30 days supply
decent for the price
ive been battling vitamin d deficiency ever since i can remember and this supplement has been helping me a lot this deficiency greatly affects my blood sugar levels so i make it a point to religiously take this supplement i have been getting decent numbers when my doctor orders complete blood panel tests  which goes to show that this supplement is doing its jobi received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes regardless i only recommend products or services i use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself im just a regular consumer and i appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying my views and opinions are from a customerend users standpoint
i was skeptical when i bought this razor due to the pricebut after using it for a couple of weeks i can say that i really like this razor dont let the price fool you the battery life is also very good my last razor would have to be recharged weekly not this one it arrived with 100 battery and ive yet to charge it and i still have plenty of battery left id buy it again in a heartbeat
no complaints at all about these generic replacement heads for a sonicare they fit well on my sonicare  not so tight that they are difficult to get on or off and not so loose that they come off too easily the fit is pretty much the same as the authentic sonicare brushesalthough these are described as being soft i would rate the bristles as medium or perhaps mediumsoft the bristles are definitely harder than the sonicare ultra soft version but are not as hard as the sonicare regular brushes i would have preferred that they be just a tad softer than they are but they are not so hard as to cause any notable gum irritation the oblong head shape is good for getting at the gum line and reaching molarsthe set of 8 come in a single box with each brush individually sealed in a plastic pouch plus theres a cap over the end of each brush i much prefer this type of packaging versus the blister pack method used by other generic replacement heads its easier to deal with and creates less packaging wasteno significant complaints about these  good value for the price
woks great at lowering blood pressure and is reasonable priced
lovely i ordered it because it reminds me of those tibetan temple wheels
nice unit but you can only set both leads to the same strength  so if you have them in different locations they are still the same strength on both lines
very portable and easy for on the go this pump worked extremely well for me easy to clean put together and charger great value for the price i used it while my little one was in the nicu and liked it better than the hospital pump definitely worth the buy
this is a 7 oz bag of usda certified organic maca root it looks and smells like i expected it smells and tastes pretty fresh to me
this did not clean my teeth better than my electric toothbrush i can feel it alas i still gave it a few days and nights to see how my teeth feeli will be sticking with the electric brush as the bristles can actually get in between my teeth this is a dense brush and i can see why they call it the cloud toothbrush on instagramfb it is really soft so for those with very sensitive gums try this its worth checking out to see if it helps youi also felt kind of nasty thinking about how id get this completely clean if i continue using it for the full amount of time as it seems food could easily get trapped in the dense bristles it does have a textured back which i assume to be a tongue cleaner however its useless each brush is in its own container with breathing holes however those are also very flimsy so if you get this knowing youll love it i would grab a toothbrush case separatelybasically felt like i was brushing with a sponge
charge lasts forever fast heatingabsolutely the best i have ever owned even comparing to others twice the cost
this is made of plastic and does not hold suction  bad product
great product and good price
we have used this for all three of our children from birth to when they get out of diapers its so gentle easy to apply and works fast
i have a lot of low backhip pain and after a day of sitting at the computer all day kills me i cant afford a fancy ergonomic office chair so i was ecstatic to see this show up ive been using it for a couple weeks now and im amazed that i feel as good or better at the end of the day as i do when i start working it conforms easily to my back while still providing excellent support its not overly molded so that it only fits one body typeshape the unique design of the rubber stays firm when and where needed but is soft and cushy where needed tooone thing to note is that the cover is a stretchy fabric like spandex which allows it to stretch over the cushion but fit closely to it there are two loops on the back which allow you to run a belt or rope to tie it in place onto your chair however since the fabric is so stretchy and the cushion fairly heavy it pulls down into the seat rather than staying against the chair back so i still have to push it up and into place when i come back to the chair im thinking of sewing a more structured cover that wont stretch so much to keep it in place betteri received a discount in exchange for an honest review
it cleans
this is just the thing to have on hand with the whole covid outbreak this is the kind of supplement that you dont need until you really need it i like that it has elderberry vitamins and b in addition to the standard vitamin c
i love the massive amount of time turmeric in these capsules turmeric is a wonderful all natural antiinflammatory joint pain fighting machine most brands that ive looked at have under 1000 mg per serving but i was looking for a product that packed a bit more of a punch and this product was the winner each serving of 3 veggie capsules contains over 2000 mg of turmeric as well as black pepper for maximum absorption its organic and each bottle contains a months worth of capsules
for the past 10 years this is the easiest way ive found to give calcium to my 30 lb dog to supplement her home made diet i use it with an oral syringe  i load it up every 10 days squirt 1 ml into her dinner every night thats it no fuss no muss  no refrigeration needed best of all her bloodwork is always just about perfect being a product for humans i can worry less about impurities that eggshells or petonly products might havei had a whole lot of trouble finding this for a while my local pharmacy stopped carrying it because they couldnt get it i couldnt find it anywhere online in the meantime i tried a different calcium solution it didnt have nearly the concentration and was very sticky it meant giving my dog even more sorbate thats not nearly as bad for them as xylitol but its always wise to keep artificial sweeteners to an absolute minimum for dogs i ended up throwing it all out the minute i could restock on the roxane version seems that roxane had to recertify it or something anyway its still hard to find and i am very glad to have found it here
its  best to have extra magnetic clips for your cpap straps good buy

i have taken 1 to 2 grams of omega 3 every day for the past two decades  my reasoning for taking the supplement varies with my ailments and the research  it has been shown to be useful for mental health inflammatory disease muscle strength and cancer prevention  i used to take it for my heart and memory but im not sure the science supports that  i take one pill a day to supplement the large quantities of fish oil i get from fresh caught fish that we eat every other dayi chose this brand because of consumer labs recommendations based on formulation concentration quality and price  not only is it one of the most concentrated capsule form but buying it in this two pack with an additional discount cut the price to 14 a pill making it the cheapest omega 3 per 500 mg
we use in our apartment bedroom for great sleep
great value and a lot of sounds to choose from doesnt seem to loop either
i thought this would be a great set and im always looking for good clippers so i ordered this setstraight out of the package the case was very sticky  i used a lens wipe to clean it off and it worked admirably buti shouldnt have tothere is quite a lot in this set but the nail clippers the standard on how i judge a nail care set both left my nails a little rough and frayed after using the nail file was fine but the other tools seemed a little rough i wouldnt necessarily want them going under my nails or pushing back my cuticlesthe ear digging tools description made me laugh are self contained in a little tube with a screw on top that is nice that you can isolate themthe heavy duty toenail clippers was the best of the lot they worked well and didnt leave my toenails jaggedso this is a cheap quality functional nail maintenance set there are better ones out there for a better price i know i have a couple i wouldnt choose this set again and i wouldnt feel comfortable giving as a gift id give it away but not as a gift if that makes sense
this is a great interim product for in between chiropractic adjustments
perfect for my grandsons 1st birthday
works for sore muscles as well as face roller
works good but theres cheaper products that do the same
as advertised
saved me money by salvaging the waterpik that i currently have over buying a new one seems to have similar design flaws as the original like the water doesnt all come out which harbors a moist environment that mildew and mold love the quality isnt as high though the hinge to the door broke on one side and snapped off on the other side the door can still seal the hole but its now a separate piece still usable but not ideal as i almost lost the door down the drain
really helped with tension in my shoulders
i blend with plain yogurt works well
looks like a 2nd hand item that id buy at a thrift shop or a dollar store
my sixteen year old suffers from neck and collarbone pain due to a sports injury this helps him to relieve pain and relax the muscles in his neck he can lay on this a few minutes at a time a few times a day and it helps tremendously its a thick curved pillow that looks uncomfortable but in reality its the opposite it steadys his neck and stretches the muscles great value
shiny black jasper with archangel sigils for michael raphael gabriel and uriel as in pictured and described i wanted these to use for my healing work and they are exactly what i wanted
feels good in your hand and is light weight but squeaks very badly on shower doors and does not make a clean sweep of the glass  is not worth the price they are asking  streeks really bad also if your lucky enough to actually get the water off the glass
the foam is much easier to clean
this is not noisy at all another person stated it was very noisy it makes a little hum soothing really my baby falls fast asleep while its on i have this in our bed room and i enjoy it the air smells cleaner and our house is brand new and very clean but it just seems fresher i am buying another for my other childs room i love it so much we own a rental and i even put them in the home to rid the other peoples smell of dog and so on the bulb last 4000 hours and should be replaced if not out by then to insure its doing its job if i was rich i would buy for every room at once but im not so i buy one at a timeside notethis is awesome next to a diaper pale or trash can
excellent organic essential oil at a very good price

i have used this product for years as a supplement to my diet and my active lifestyle  unfortunately it is not vegan so i had to stop using it  if your are not vegan i suggest you try fruitein before other similar products

not great compression unfortunately i wasnt able to return these so im stuck with them now i wouldnt purchase them if you need tighter 2030mmhg compression as they fit more like sort of snug socks
ive never tried a protein drink thats basically a shot its a novel concept that i enjoy very much the bottle is small enough to fit in a bag to take on the go you can drink it alone or add it to other liquids the flavor is pleasant there are artificial flavors if youre trying to avoid them otherwise this is a good productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
i chose this curling brush because i read ceramic tourmaline is for thinner fine hair like i have it produced nice curls and my hair stayed curly a little longer than usual but i didnt see anything much different than other curling brushesi had quite a difficult time learning how to curl my hair without a clip i guess the no clip is for curls to look more naturali think it is a misprint that it is on sale from 149 as it statesit did the job of curling my hair but it didnt go above and beyond regular curlers
great size to carry with me
the only thing that works for sore swollen feet  ive used it for years and now i cannot live without it while pregnant  nothing else even comes close
this the wright size for everyone
just okay  serve their purpose
i cant explain how many different places  companies ive tried this is good if you shift around and like to shake your booty some people say it collapses yeah it does but i dont know its a good option if you move in your seat and want a little refreshment
i dont know what planet you guys are on but this is the worst car cleaner ever it leaves a white residue thats almost impossible to get off even if you rub it immediately after you put it on im returning it whatever you do do not buy this product

great balloon that literally stayed filled for weeks large and beautiful perfect for any birthday or occasion
i really like this got this for my 7 year old son he loves the taste great quality contains organic vitamins and minerals definitely yes
used this soap the day that i received it  havent a negative thing to say about this product  it is just exactly described justas it is  very hard in the container and looks as though its been poured in  while it was hot  very rustic looking in the plasticcontainer  as it is supposed to lookyou can tell that some serious work went into the making of this soap  by its performance  after running hot water into thebowl and using a fine shaving soap brush  you will get a very rich creamy good smelling lather  you will get a close shavewith minimal nicks and irritationanother fine point is  you will enjoy a unique old time barbershop scent while shaving  an important point is  this soap isin line with other brands of shaving soaps according to price  you cannot order a good quality can of shaving soap for lessthat 15 dollars  this shaving soap is somewhat a cut above your average shaving soap on the market today  therefore  ican comfortably say that this shaving soap is a fair price for the quality that it  factually isit appears that you will able to get months of shaving from this reasonably large can of shaving soap  the container is not a cheapplastic  it is a heavy duty plastic jar with a screw on lid that fits precision and will screw on tightly to keep your soap freshthis container will not allow your soap to dry out  all in all  i cannot find fault with this product or the seller
up until recently its been hard to find good vegan sources of d3 this is a powerful source of veggie d3 that packs double the punch of my usual supplies of vitamin d3 usually i find 5000 iu to be the standard ive read varying opinions about 5k and have heard that the body doesnt absorb larger amounts as well as 2k or smaller the national academy of medicine lists the upper daily limit at 4000 iu though doses up to 10000 iu have been found not to cause toxicity in healthy humans for this reason i wont be taking daily megadoses of vitamin d i will take these capsules once or twice a week in supplement to my daily multivitamin which contains 100 of my daily supply of vitamin d i like taking more especially during the winter as my health insurance does not approve vitamin d tests in healthy individuals my ageall that said this is a good quality mushroombased source of vitamin d3 formulated by a former cleveland clinic doctor recommended and longlasting if one takes once or twice a week as a supplement to daily multivitamins im set for a year or two
the glue tabs are not going to hold this  i used pins eventually after having it fall down several times  it does require some slight assembly as the letters are not all connected like it appears in the picture and do not come on the ribbon  not really a big deal though
works well
excellent product and your service too

i have tried so many sleep masks over the years and this is in my top ten  its comfortable and easy to wear  the strap is adjustable and it isnt bulky under my head when im sleeping on my back  it washed well in a lingerie bag and hung up to air dry  the material and foam are both soft against the skin  i have long lashes and masks usually rub against them and drive me nuts but this stands far enough away from my eyes that it doesnt bother me  these work really well for blocking out all light  a
does the job but the caps on the large bottles dont always go on correctlythey dont seem to line up right and have sipped off when i didnt triplecheck to make sure it had latched  this doesnt to be a problem with the smaller ones so i guess it was something offspecification in the manufacturing of the larger ones
spendbut worth the bucks really does a fabulous job if you follow the directions
i use this product per dr recommendation to treat corneal edema so when i dont use this type of product my eyes get very blurry i will agree with other reviewers this product is thicker and gloopier than competitors however in all the brands i have tried i have never found one that keeps my eues clearer i am really happy to have found this no it may not be the easiestmost comfortable to apply but for me it works
this probiotic was recommended by my ocupancturist to promote my immune system two years ago i have been taking one a day and it has been working very well for me when i get a cold it wont last a long time
love the smell not sweet and cloying like some others also keeps bugs away had an ant problem at one apartment used this around any sweet drink no more ants in my tea or soda no more ants on my tables around the windows and doors they stopped coming in all the bugs stayed away
i like the size there is a large handle and a large compartment for collecting the lint
in this day and age of excessive hand washing  i had to have some of these to save my poor cracked over washed hands  still have to do the dishes  they are extra long  i consider myself to have a medium size hand and they are snug  but not too  comes with a set of 3 in 3 different colors  that happen to work for spring right now  but who really cares  my hands are grateful
loved the price and product
my feet are horrendous its genetic and also i wear a lot of flops or go barefoot all the time so callouses are just a normal thing for me i get a pedicure once a month and even that never did much what i actually do it use the blade shaver and shave most of the big callouses off and then use this to smooth it all down my feet arent baby soft but theyre no longer rough i love that they send you so many extra sand paper discs i do my feet like once a week and im no where near halfway done and ive had this thing for months now i do have to us one disc for each foot because of the amount of callousing all over my feet but the end result is great i then lotion my feet up and the next day they are nice and smooth totally worth the money
this suction cup really sticks  it is very strong and holds the shower so i can sit and wash my hair
i love these little lanyards to keep up with my masks they are always handy and it helpskeeping them clean
when i got it the seal was open im pretty sure its fine other than that i love it
i drink a lot of coffee so decided on buying this i did not notice any difference on my teeth will say since i have sensitive teeth worked out great on that point but did not see whitening effect using this
great product  i was always so cold and the space heater made the air dry but it was never warm enough to work without a coat and gloves on  with the heater on my chair is comfortable my body is warm and the air is no longer super dry  with the legs and back being heated my arms are no longer frozen and i finally have feeling in my fingersas a bonus the heated pad is great for any soreness in legs and lower back which has made my sleep significantly better  highly recommend this item
during the great glove shortage of 2020 i decided to invest in some long reusable gloves while they arent as form fitting as regular nitrile gloves im able to wipe down groceries and open packages just finemaybe someday soon i will use them for their original intent and wash the dishes with them
this essential oil is a blend of sweet orange neroli and thyme the combination evolves into a delicious orange aroma i use about four to five drops in each of my diffusers and the fragrance wafts through the entire room it is lovelythe current price of 999 is expensive for 17 fluid ounces however since i like the aroma so much i did not take off one star for the high price
very nice glad i found it on the internet but personally i feel 1600 too much in price  for this tiny small bottle i do like frankincense and myrrh  recommendglad when it goes on so so sale it is a good oil  thanks
perfect for just about anything been using these about 6 months now and they are durable used for colloidal silver in the eyes ears and nose when necessary and never let us down
fast delivery and work steadily
i gave this a five star for easy to inflate because i had a special pump from a previous purchase that made this easy  without a pump it would not be easy  this was a great affordable 2020 decorations
there are some good things and less good about this but the review comes with the caveat that sleep preferences are so individual that its tough to say how much ones view should hold for someone else but that said1 size  the footprint is nice it doesnt take up a lot of space id call it medium size maybe leaning toward small ive definitely seen many that were bigger so you dont need a lot of space to use this2 lighting  id prefer a dimmer light personally thought the breath function and colors are nice if you have this right near the bed its a bit too bright id say but if its obstructed or youre  not facing it than it isnt bad at all3 volume  volume control is goodim not sure why youd want it loud i guess if you have a lot of street noise but it can get a decent volume on it4 sounds  this was the more problematic issue for us we just didnt find many of the sounds pleasurable or soothing some would have soothing parts but then a loud surge of sound would appear which would seem to defeat the purpose weve heard others that were just more tranquil soothing some of that can be somewhat ameliorated by the volume control obviously but still wasnt what we were expecting there are a good number and variety but honestly wed only use 3 possibly 4 on the other hand if youre looking for drownout sound you might find that less of an issue5 timer is good and works well never understood ones that came without them so this is a good id say required touchits a useful solid product but not quite as allaround useful as its numbers of lightssounds might indicate at least for us  no concerns over qualityfeels well constructed and responsive
i listened to the audiobook magnesium miracle and read so many good reviews i took this for anxiety which i get very easily 2 to 3 hours after i consumed this i had very bad anxiety for no reason  it is no fun feeling like you cant get a good breath of air and your heart is beating so fast  i will not take another drop  as everything i purchase on amazon i always get to return if not satisfied  but checking this better i cannot return it therefore 2999 plus tax of 272 and shipping cost of 694 3965 down the drain
fits perfectly
biz beats every other laundry additive ive every used  my mom used it decades ago when i was growing up and it still works better than anything else on the market  i cant figure out why its so hard to find in stores  i guess because they dont spend a lot on mass advertising so there is little demand  most sellers on amazon were pretty expensive imo but by buying a pack of 4 boxes i got the best price  itll probably last until my grandkids grow up but at least i have a good stash now  for really tough stains make a paste and spread the paste on stain  let it sit and work for up to hours before washing  ive never had an issue with this technique damaging colors
good quality
love these to clean my mat with and to spray for odor mine didnt come with 6 towels but i contacted a rep and she replied and personally mailed me the 6 replacement towels
bought two of these for my husband hes a big man and no one size fits all works this one did hes not quite as cranky wearing this mask and he likes how it has the neck strap so he can rip it off the minute its allowed and it hangs from his neck i just ordered one for myself just because its bigger and hopefully i can breath easier in it we are not happy mask ppl we both wear glasses that fog up when wearing them they still fog up with this one but adjusted just right and its not as bad
did  not help me with shoe slipping
the paper towels are very soft and the design is simply beautiful the value of the paper towels are great and i think these towels can be good decoration for my room
great way to supplement your daily smoothiefruitveggie shake with vitamins given that this is certified organic vegan  nongmo it is a great all natural way to give your body an extra boost of vitamin c i am deleting a star simply because when i first tried to mix this in just juice i saw that the powder does not mix well my juice was cloudy however i started instead to mix it with my smoothies and it worked perfectly no taste blends well when the mixture is thicker
these are just like the ones they put in your car at the carwash and the smell lasts a long time
love the large size does the job
this contraption works  i have a little tummy and some of my jeans fit fine in the hips but pinch at the waist  i stretch them out using this device and wallah they fit like they are custom made
great product easy to take and i believe effective i trust life extensions as a company i consider them to have integrity and they certainly have a good reputation
i have been taking this pill for a few days and they are easy to swallow the instructions say to take with a meal so i have been taking them with my lunch the smell is a bit unpleasant at first but you get used to it after a few days havent noticed any changes yet but i am sure that will come within time you cant go wrong with the price compared to other probiotics
my sheepskin boots dont have a removable insole and had gotten very unfluffy at the bottom these fixed that and i will get at least another year out of the boots thanks
these gloves fit as expected  i use them mostly for household chores but will use them for washing things outside such as vehicles and patio furniture once the snow thaws and springtime arrives  i have no preference for either lined or unlined  i especially like them for washing fragile glass items because even in soapy water the gloves keep the glassware from slipping out of my hands  i also like the length for protecting my hands and forearms while reaching into a bucket
perfect for a small bathroom
having two kids we have tried few similar items i can say that this one is much gentler on kids than fridait is easy to use and works fast and easy to clean
product is amazing thank you
they use intesinal binding fillers  maybe thats why no full label ie ingreds shown my glands swell cannot swallow and i lose fingernails if ingest magnesium stearate it is not benign
i needed a strap for my son who wears glasses and has hearing aids something that would allow him to easily pull his mask up and down without pulling off his hearing aids the strap connects to the mask and fits nicely around the back of the neck which means one less thing behind my sons ears these straps were super easy to attach to the mask they adjust easily and the quantity ensures i have plenty in case some are lost they also wash up well in case i forget to detatch them from the cloth mask during washing i highly recommend these straps for those who struggle with straps behind the ears
tasteless does not whiten as i expected
my mom raved about the old fashioned norelco electric razors but id never tried one quite like it this 5head razor gives me the closest shave ever where has it been all my life usually my electric razors are good in a pinch but they always make look like i have 12 days growth this shaver is different its just as close as a manual razor my legs and underarms are just as smooth as if ive just whipped out the shaving cream and straight razor i also love how the five heads are put together in natural curves to complement the human body its as if this was custom designed to fit over my knee caps  and how many electric shavers can actually get the knees smooth up and down or around in circles this safe razor will never hurt youas an awesome bonus this razor comes with several attachments to change attachments and to clean it read the manual and have some faith that pushing and pulling wont break the device ive tried the trimmer with the three levels of attachments and its not barberquality but its good enough in a pinch the facial massage and scrubber are really nice the dry brush massage is so gentle and the soft plastic scrubber really adds an extra oomph to my cleanser thankfully i havent had to use the nose hair clippers so i cant report on the effectivenessit also comes with a little brush to clean under the heads again read the manual and a small bottle of oil so you can replenish the lubrication my device came prelubricated which was nice its easy to hold quick and easy to charge in a usb port cord included and the electric display shows how much time is left before you need to recharge it is not waterproof though so dont take it into the bath dry off and use it after
i tried using this for a few days and the hardness of the plastic really bothered me the literature that came with the item did say the plastic was hard and it might take you some time to get used to it but i got headaches and only used it a short timei did keep it and may try using it again
does the job
tastes awful hope it works to steady my gait
the bristles only extend about halfway up my teeth  my teeth were not clean after using this its in the trash already
to slick a material  food falls to floor
good product love that its clean but does not dissolve as well as other brands of peptides i have tried their bcaas are awesome though
works very well for our needs
great product fast shipping
i buy the big box of eggs and was reusing the stryophome cartoons and i came across these and have never looked back
we love these great taste and consistency 5 a bag cheaper than vitamin shoppe delivered to my door awesome
they work really well but i hate bubble gum flavor that being said its not overpowering
the compression is literally comforting
i am new to this brand joon x moon and find them very giftable  the packaging is beautiful and their scrubs and bubble bath fizz formulas would cheer me or my friends up at the end of a long weekthe bubbling bath fizz has a lovely scent which permeates the bathroom for a while as well  i tried both the lavender and the champagne scents and loved them the instructions dont say how much to put so i put 2 capfuls and this was enough to give gentle bubbles and a lovely scentthe lavender is strong but not medicinal and the champagne has a slightly fruitier almost lychee undertone  both are lovely and not overly sweet  the bubbles are soft and plentiful and the scents are relaxing and make me feel like i am somewhere else  the minerals in the bath also feel soothing  overall it feels very pampering and helps to wash away a tough weeki love the way that these bottles look in the bathroom as well  another reviewer mentioned theyd prefer to have them in glass containers but it feels safer not to have glass in the bathroom where it might slip or get knocked off
little packets resisted tearing open for me i ended up needing scissors or a knife to easily open these the flavor was okay seemed to help in hydrating the skin something i need a lot of help with ive had better mixins and ive had worse
ive taken milk thistle for several years to protect my liver against the daily damage i do to it with alcohol ibuprofen and whatever else hurts it this product is as good as it gets very high concentration super clean smelling 120 capsules per bottle  excellent value i take nightly my last blood screens came back in normal range doc said all looks great i believe in the power of this
they are vary good to use
so i had been buying the primal life dirty mouth tooth powder and was loving it except the price was gouging me so i went on the hunt for a more affordable tooth powder option i stumbled upon this for half the price and decided to give it a go in terms of tooth cleanliness it probably works about the same ya about the same however it sucks every single last drop of moisture out of your mouth the second it hits it the mint is also not very strong at all it in no way helps freshen my breath and my husband and i have started having to use mouth wash which imo defeats the purpose of going chemical free also because it does suck moisture out ive found that chunks of it get stuck to my teeth or gums and i have to do a clean run through of my toothbrush with just water on it to get this off just swigging with water wont do it weve hand this over a month and still have over half the jar left so honestly its a good amount of product for what you payim still on the fence though if im gonna reorder this or go back to the primal life toothe powder
this item was purchased as a gift for my insomniac motherinlawshe absolutely loved the feature of stars on the ceilingshe said that it reminded her of camping as a young girl out under the starsthe soothing tones and sparkling stars have put this grandma to sleep 
colors match picturemix of vibrant black and greymaterial is a little toughseems very tight making it kind of hardlathers okay but not so good because of how tight it isused it about 3 times so far and seems to be loosening up
works great and shipped quickly
my puppies ignore this i was disappointed became they chew everything shoes furniture chairs etc i had wished they would love this instead they do like pigs ears
i purchased this wrap for after the shower while im getting ready for work its thin but still absorbent and the color is a pretty blue the velcro is easy to attachdetach when putting on the wrap the length could be shorter for me to love it but it still serves the purpose and well
i have never liked sponges until now magic eraser does a better job on my washable wallpaper than terry it did not scratch or cloud up my chrome fixtures when i removed hard water deposits and i didnt even have to use vinegar after testing a spot i cleaned my stainless steel sink im looking forward to wiping my showertub without cleaning product fumes i wont use the sponge everywhere for everything but for those 4 chores its a winner
ive had them for a day and i love them i work outside all day and it was a pain to keep switching from my sunglasses to my readers now i dont have to unless im in a poorly lit place i highly recommend them 
really expensive for what you get  not really that exciting if you are looking for a laugh and want to spend a lot to get itthen go ahead
this is a supplement in powder format that you mix with water the mixing process isnt totally smooth there are generally little clumps in the water but it doesnt really bother me that much im just trying to get it down quickly anway there is a taste but its not anything terrible and is pretty easy to get down as to the results i cant tell at this point if this has changed my digestion but i do find the research very interesting and will continue to see how things progress as i continue to take this each day
i have a few of these towel wraps and find them very convenient  i usually use them when im getting ready instead of wearing a robe  theyre reasonably absorbent they stay in place and are less bulky than a robe  laundering is easy and inexpensive and they provide decent coverage
these gloves are awesome thick enough that someone as clumsy as me dont have to worry about destroying them
my wife loves this lotion  she does not have diabetes but does have dry scaly feet blue emu does the job for her
i was initially skeptical about this thinking that it might leave white marks on my body or make my towel oily but turns out its super easy to apply after shower because of all the moisture still left on the skin and it turns clear on the skin after applying and doesnt stain my towel either i like how smooth it feels and how fast and easy to apply will toss out my regular lotion and use this one from now on
i was really looking forward to receiving this item because of the way it appeared on the site unfortunately my first night using it was a bid disappointment the mask is soft and plush to the touch however when worn at night the nose bridge part presses way too hard on the top of the nose and impedes breathing if i loosen the strap which is not velcro and gets tangled in the hair the mask then is too loose and falls off the face the pads press just too much on the bottoms of the eyes and make it uncomfortable to breathe and turn the head the strap gets tangled in the hair because you cant velcro it over the back you have to pull it over the head the padding is weighted incorrectly and caused me discomfort while trying to breathe and sleep with it therefore i had to return it  maybe for less sensitive sleepers this might work  but this was advertised as designed for ultra comfort and sensitivity
bought this for my 76 year old mom who does not have a land line her cell does not ring loud enough at home needed it to be louder so she could hear it everywhere in the condo and this device does the trick she is very satisfied
this really is an excellent toe nail clippermuch better than the typical style most people use and easily the best i have tried the longhandled small scissorsontheend type are hard to use and often do not cut cleanly and easilyfor the average person however im not sure i would recommend it for fingernails since it can leave a bit of a rough edge
is it just me or has the company started using less lotion in their product  its just the same as using regular puffs of kleenex
good product better than liquid always rely on it will order again when needed good price
they run small son is thin and wears a size 95 shoe these are tight on him if you are a bigger person they may be uncomfortabletight
after installing this to my waterpik and trying it out for the first time there is a slight leak that drips from the handle down the hose  its only a few drops each use but there shouldnt be any  also i cant explain why the pressure doesnt seem to be as strong as the original
i bought this for my sister who is onto special effects makeup as a birthday gift in the description it says that this item is ammonia free which was exciting because she always complains about her eyes burning because of the ammonia i just opened the package and on the ingredients list is ammonia hydroxide and ammonia im sure she will still love the liquid latex but its disappointing that it has ammonia in it i will not repurchase this
i normally just clean my mat with soap  water but this method tends to make the mat too slippery which is unsafe this cleaner comes with a microfiber cloth and it only takes a quick spray or two to cleanse the entire surface without losing grip i would recommend this product to anyone who regularly uses a mat
this could have a been a nice desserty protein bar coming out of your dessertsnacks calorie budget instead of the main meals unfortunately the various mass market ingredients they put in it give it a not so pleasant after taste an after taste i never get with protein bars that use only 34real food34 ingredientsso while it tastes fine while you eat it and tempts you to forgive the long list of ingredients the after taste is a reminder of what it is  maybe they can make 34real food34 version of thisthe 6pack is stored in a sturdy compact purple cardboard box which you can easily repurpose for other household uses if you open it gentlynutrition wise it has plenty of vitamins and minerals protein 34wins34 1514 over sugars itt is a product of canadasweetening in this is done with among others glucose syrup sugar glycerine high maltose corn syrup evaporated cane sugar fructose dextrose etcthis is so frustrating because its a promising taste combo with 15g of protein but you get all kinds of corporate food crap including carrageenan
sleeptoo much noise around here
accurate description fast shipping
too tight
did nothing for me
just as described holds to basics
i heard about these a few years ago how great they are for your teeth well after finally trying them i must say that they did not disappoint first of all with these each one is individually wrapped and they look very sanitary i didnt feel uncomfortable at all peeling off the outer bark and chewing on the stick it does have a flavor which is sort of indescribable but bits can come off in your mouth and they are much like shredded coconut anyway after softening and chewing the tip in your mouth by gently chewing on it the fibers fan out to form a brush while the stick is long its impossible to get the inside of your teeth but as you use it up its easier to get your hand in thereso i wouldnt use these as a replacement for my toothbrush but they are a wonderful accompaniment my teeth feel great after using it it brushes all the plaque away and leaves you feeling super clean but without any mint each stick lasts quite a while because you only use half an inch each time and then use a scissors to snip off the used part so that it remains sanitaryif youve never tried these all i can say is that my experience was pretty good and i would definitely recommend them i hope this review and the video has helped you to decide if youd like to invest in these
i dont know if the good reviews are paid to say what they are saying but this item certainly did not work for me a waste of 20 i have wavy hair and its not hard to manage but this brush did not straighten it at all
get the same results buying the ones in targeti would not purchase these
my two cats often get runny eyesallergycold side effects this helps tremendously
i purchased the 34got milk34 straws on sale for 1796pk at target and my kids loved them i wasnt going to target for a few weeks so i decided to purchase these since it is a mix of flavors  my kids so far have enjoyed them  they are a bit more expensive but the container is very nice and the lid snaps on so they are not in a ziploc bag or just laying on a pantry shelf  i think it was worth the purchase for the container alone  they look just like the 34got milk34 straws but that is nowhere on the package  this definitely is a mix it is not a single flavor which is nice and exciting for the kids
i buy these monthly and i have no complaints  i dont mind the boost of energy these give you  the only thing missing is iron which i dont think is ever contained in a daily vitamin anyway
bought these for my husband and he loves them we use them about three times before throwing away
easy to carry and works perfectly
weird texture not so good
lathers nicely convenient pump moisturizing but smells like a cheap pina colada you wish you hadnt bought
works well with all smoking parts worth the extra 2 to get the cap holes for stems and bowls
great addition to shaving cream this glycerin really helps shaving cream retain water in its lather  this seems be the secret to a thick and rich shaving cream that one whips up with a shaving brush the quart size is a great value i only have one minor complaint  the bottle does not have lid that lends itself to controlled dispensing i addressed this minor quibble by using an old squeeze bottle with a dropper top
i have cspine injury i am treating with decompression therapy in doctors office  this device allows me support and decompression like therapy at home and is easy to use adjustable tension to fit your needs a little uncomfortable on the ears takes some getting used to
its fine i have my preferences over this this is a nice blend of various collagen sources bovine marine poultry eggshell and therefore a wider degree of collagen types 1 2 3 5 10 hence the elevated price tag i dont rate on price but i will comment that it should be compared to others of this ilk it is with similar price range some sources are more expensive some sources dont require as much to be effective ie bovine is cheapest but needs more marine is usually most expensive yet needs a lot less this has a good amount well fair amount per serving at about 8 grams of collagen peptides hydrolyzed meaning it is broken down to readily absorbable easily digestible form and it mixes in hot or cold without gellingmulti forms can impart a slight smell and flavor i think the ones that use eggshell tend to have a little extra aroma may disappear depending on what it is being used in or might be noticeable not a big fan of it in my plain black unsweetened coffee but is totally fine in a smoothie or when i have a coffee that i doctor up with cream and flavor syrup i dont fault the brand as it is merely a facet of the composition i will always used collagen often single source but will pepper in multi source as i see fitthis is a perfectly fine product though i recommend that they actually include a picture of the nutritional information we dont need to see half a dozen pictures of people drinking it let us know what is in it had i been shopping around for it i would have passed this over for a listing that tells me all that i am gettingthough i am pleased to see thisif youre not 100 satisfied with your purchase well issue you a refund
these all smell great and worked well very moisturizing and fun to use in the bath we loved each and every one of them
a bit greasy but works well
my partner likes to fall asleep to youtube podcasts and not the quiet kind either music laughter i cannot tune that stuff out bought this pillow mat in desperation not really trusting reviews but it honestly and truly works he puts it under his head and i cant hear a thing i cant even tell its on  he says its perfectly comfortable much more comfortable than headphones or headbands with speakers some people say the wire breaks after a lot of use honestly i dont care i mean i hope it holds up but since this is the only solution that works for us well just spring for another onethe only downside is he cant use it very well when hes sitting up in bed so we need both headphones and the pillow mat
these were great tissues good for dry noses as well
nice small and powerful
comfortable fit well good value for price
ive been using this tumeric for over a month now and its a good product
this is a very cool scale i have a fitbit zip and i have the app on my android phone when i weigh myself the weight and the body fat percent travels right over to my phone it took a little while to understand how to set it up but it works great and i love it
this is significantly larger than most adjustable adult collars and after having it on for only a half hour the velcro that the strap attaches to came off not nearly as good as the ones we used to keep on the ambulances im a former emt in one of the busiest jurisdictions in the country just for some perspective im really only giving it two stars because its nice to see one in olive drab instead of blue and yellow
bought these for my husband as certain shoes were rubbing on ankle bone and irritating fit him well and cushion stays in place easy to hand wash and dries overnight good product would buy again
this is a great way to get zinc which has so many valuable properties for health just a few good tasting drops per day of this readily absorbed form and youre good to go one less capsule or tablet to take good value
the big question  can you tell its fish oil not really  its orange flavored which does a good job of masking the taste and you really cant tell that theyre fish by nature  not saying that theyre a perfect orange flavor  theres something undefinable about the taste that is just a little odd but if i told you they were gummy candies you probably wouldnt bat an eyelash  decent omega3 content and if you dont like the pill version of fish oil this will work quite well
ive had very good results using this toothpaste after a couple of weeks its very pleasant to use with a nice aftertaste and it leaves my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean i have noticed some whitening as well three tubes for the current price of 1899 is a decent deal
doesnt work all the time
perfect for variety of holiday gifts
great product quick delivery very satisfied
as expected  good quality  bandaids
i got these as a gift and will not return them but they are very clunky to walk in massage barely noticeable while standing and very  i mean annoyingly loud buzzing while sitting cant hear tv over the buzz was a nice thought for a gift i wouldnt recommend them
dear cats decided to hurl my old one off my desk and cracked the lid in halfso i got this replacement its the same but was hard to get together and hard to get apart and rattledi got some vaseline ran a little around the grooves and now its easy to open easy to close and doesnt rattle feels much better yay vaseline
not a bad taste at all
the dont scrub like i wanted
when growing up we often had a battery bag which contained batteries of various sizes and makes which had been pulled from electronics or opened battery packages and were still good in one way or another i am a creature of order however and such slapdash methods are no longer satisfactory to me especially since there is the possibility of a circuit being created in there between cells of various sizes and chargesthis is a far more elegant solution i have these sorts of holders for every kind of battery i own and they are all neatly stored in a ziplock bag in a box i always know exactly how many batteries i have and thus when i need to order more the cells are kept isolated from oneanother and in tight formation i even keep a couple in my hiking pack  no digging around the bottom of the bag for a stray aaa attempting an escapeif i am giving someone a gift which requires batteries i will usually include a holder like this with it filled with the appropriate type of lithium cells the presentation is onpoint and it ensure that not only can they use the gift immediately but can continue to use it for the next couple years or sothe build quality is good the batteries are easy to insert and remove and the clear plastic leaves no question as to how many cells are in the holder and what sort of cells they arewould recommend
do not waste your money  these are a joke  they wrinkle up once they get wet and then the center never dries  its like trying to wash with a wrinkly piece of cardboard
i bought this  because my dr reccomendedit works great
these disposable masks are like every other 3ply disposable mask of this type that i tried so far they have comfortable ear elastics and the mask is pleated and moldable to the nose with the interior wire  there are 50 masks in this package  the current price of 899 is a great deal for 50 which comes to 18 cents each  since these are disposable they are not designed to last obviously
the flavour is very good and it keeps me feeling my best with better energy and digestion and i take it daily
i like this product it does the job i just dont like how if you dont wipe it totally off theres pink residue that sits on your things i mean unless you know its cleaner it ends up looking gross maybe i just need to do a better job cleaning im not sure
im thinking that this thing wouldve been bigger than that tiny thing ive gotten in my mailed box smh but guessed wrong smh ive had kept my money i used it once and didnt have my skin feeling flawless right so im better than using my hands instead of using this seriously omg when i washed my face with my hands it feels super flawless soft and also right with the face washed i gotten from the store makes its super flawless soft and cleaned as ever hands down seriously god bless
these fit my sons toothbrush perfectly and they work just like the ones that came with it
i been looking for one of these for a good price and i came across this one study and heavy and really works there is different heads and the speed is gradually increased so that you wont be hit with a woop quickly i like the one with the round tip for specific points to focus one battery like is good too since i used for about a week without recharging it
i am always on the lookout for some good mangesium powders  i use them at night before i go to sleephow this comesthis comes in a glass jar and is well packedfullthe jar in the photo was taken after i only took two scoops of product  the fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is  it really should be a bit fuller than it waseasy to takethis is not difficult to take  it is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink itflavori did not find the flavor offensive  some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag  this one was not like that for me at all  it is actually pleasant to take uncluttered with sweetnersdoes it helpthis is really helpful to relax me at nightthe bottom linethis powder is pleasant to take  it is not cluttered with stevia or other additivesmy ratingfive stars i am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added  i only wish it was a little fuller
very difficult ft tissues

i understand the chemistry behind hydrogen peroxidebased cleaners  but even so this product seems to work better than it should  i was cleaning around the door knobs of our exterior doorsyou know  the areas that always become soiled on a door  the dirt and soil just seemed to be evaporating  in other words i wasnt seeing most of the dirt and soil transfer to the paper towels i was wiping with  it was just disappearing  amazing stuff
capsule was deflated i brought the capsule to my physical therapist who recommended the device the pt said the capsule was deflated meaning there was not enough gelatin inside it for the device to perform what it was meant for

this was a reorder
70 alcohol was hard to find and somewhat expensive due to covid scare
ive reviewed a lot apple cider vinegar gummies and these are my least favorite of all of them  the flavor is just ok and the texture is not very gummylike  i like that these have the mother but thats about all they have going for them except for a little b9 and b12 vitamins
there are two slimprofile sixcell travelsized pill cases in this package along with 54 labels each of the cells has a good clasp that snaps tightly shut in my photo i was able to fit 20 of my 50mcg d3 tablets into one cell their portability and slimprofile are the best features note that it will not store more than a couple of  horsesized pills and may not be able to store any depending on the size of the capsule the cell covers do not fully stay open when removing or inserting the pills so be prepared for it to stay only partially openalso note that there is a right way and wrong way to insert the case into its holder the side with the finger nubs on the case is the correct faceup position to insert the pill case with the lids facing up it does not go in correctly if the case is flippedthe current price of 899 is competitively priced as it comes to 4 per case
solid built  i wish the handle was a little longer
great buy  very happy
i have used these in the past and like them very much for buffing the ends of my nails that are currently having a tendency to chip  for the price these work very well and i would recommend them
when the puppy has an oops i usually use a product with enzymes in it to break down the odors and any oops that needs to be removed this i have been putting on the patio where both go to potty to remove that odor too i have been using this all over the place it takes a while to dry  but it works
i have extremely low blood pressure my cardiologist recommended that i eat more salt unfortunately i was unable to eat enough to raise my blood pressure the pills helped a little more than salting my food now im taking a prescription medication to raise my blood pressure to normal so i dont fall if i stand up quickly

i purchased the petals to use in a ash scatter ceremony  the petals were beautiful looked just like the picture and smelled wonderful  there was a large amount and it was definitely worth the money although it was for a sad purpose the petals added a pretty touch very happy i made this purchase

not great direction on how to specifically use had to youtube it got stuck in hair a few times that hurt and tied a not but after youtube  i was able to figure it out battery doesnt stayed charged for 60 mins as stated did 6 strands and 50 battery down  why dont products with usb cords come with outlet plugins cant do my half head without it dying not worth buying only if u have shirt thin hair
doesnt really clean anything
fabulous stuff for your everyday needs
this made my skin feel so smooth and look so clear
the upside is that this is a very well made little lampits easy to start and produces a hot and steady flameif you need a light duty flame hot enough to heat a test tube or sterilize inoculation needle its just fineif you need a bigger flame as standard wick based lamp is betteri use everclear as fuel as i needed non toxic vaporsover all a well made product
i have been mixing this powder into my morning smoothies not part of a workout routine just for added energy and nutrition i really like it and cannot taste the powder at all i highly recommend this powder my old gripe is that the packaging is a little small or smaller than i expected and there is no measuring spoon or tool included given the size of the container this is to be expected but i wanted to let buyers knowi disclose that i have received this item as a free gift or at a discount when i accept invitations to receive items to review i promise that i will post my unbiased opinion with the intent of helping amazon customers make the right buying decision for them and also to increase awareness of the item that will help reduce returns if i do review a gifted item and the giver of the gift prefers my review to be private between them and i and not posted on amazon publicly i will honor that givers request please note that if this review is labeled verified purchase the item came from amazon stock and you can be assured that what i received is representative of what you will receive when you order from this listing

my 7 yr old granddaughter wears the masks every night and she loves them  she used to wear a plain black mask but no more  sometimes during the day i see her with the mask on top of her head
use these in home security system seem to be just as good as duracell
this is great to get that extra blood flow going and definitely more affordable then some of the other brands if you play sports or engage in high activity i highly recommend this product i use for weights and jogging l arginine is always a good supplement to use
does a fair job whoever  iif you are supposed to prick your finger you need lancelets
these are great measure your calves because it makes a difference if your calves are wide then order accordingly great colors to choose from too
easy to apply and remove they can get slick if your face gets sweaty or oily they are nice and thin so they dont affect the way your glasses fit tremendously other than to give them a little more stability
pretty expensive but does the job
these are delicious to the point that its hard to just suck on them and not eat the bag they didnt do much for my throat but they were tasty enough to take my mind off it they are overpriced though not worth a 50 cents a lozenge
theyre pretty basic and work fine but there are a lot of them so its a good deal
these are the same ones they sell at my gym for 50 cents a pair  they are a bit awkward but considering you wear them for 5 minutes and then toss in the trash they work fine  plus they eliminate any tan lines around the eyes like the aroundthehead eyeprotectors
good valueprice for glass cleaners
right on
this is my third order of this  we both like them  the taste is good and even better when mixed with a little orange juice  this is a good way for us to get added electrolytes and also get vitaminswe like this and are happy to have it
nice and heavy duty was perfect

using it in my car has helped tremendously with pain running up the backs of my legs thank you
this is probably pretty gross i purchased a burn brush to clean out my coffee pot and remove seven years of build up inside of it but it was still a little unsettled but maybe the inside of the pot was not 100 cleaned so i purchased this and put some in the pot left it in there for about for five hours and then poured it out and then looked inside the pot and it was shiny include stainless steel which was excellent i rinsed it out twice this morning i had my 1st cup of coffee out of the pot and it tasted great well ive been missing over the last couple years of not having a totally crystal clean product i recommend the strongly i will definitely repurchase this in the future and plan on using it on a regular basis to avoid seven years of scale that was disgusting
thumbs up
ive taken this product for years and ive watched the price rise from 40 to almost 70  since i never wanted to run out i order a few in advance and they come wrapped in a plastic you cannot see through  the instructions have always been 2 scoops a day  but now without every saying a word they doubled the size of the scope but didnt increase the amount of product  its literally twice the size  so now you are getting a crap load of filler and using twice the product so twice the price without you ever noticing  ill use up what i have because its too late to return but i will never buy from this company again  what a total bate and switch
best wrap made
these are actually really tasty  i use them for a quick breakfast on a busy day and honestly they keep me full until lunch  i also like these for those exhausting workout sessions  perfect for and all day hike also  taste is like a peanut butter cup with a smooth chew texture  easy to break into 1 hour portions if your on a grueling day and want to portion this out  great protien content and calorie ratio  this is a real winner
i suffer from a chronic pain condition and sadly have found it necessary to buy a seat for my shower because i can no longer stand up long enough to shower without intense pain i am on the younger side and the idea of having a medical supplies looking seat in my shower embarrassed me so much well having a seat at all embarrasses me but we do what we have to right so i was thrilled to find these cute little bath stools i was worried it wouldnt hold up as well but so far its really perfect its comfortable doesnt take up much room in my shower and its cute people think i bought it to get a spa like experience in my shower which works for me ha ha  the legs look thin in there photo but it has zero issues holding me up and its perfectly sturdy claims to hold up to 300lbs and i feel safe using it thanks to the company who makes these giving us more stylish choices for products we really wish we didnt need
seems like a quality product i mixed a scoop with water ice and frozen banana for a quick protein smoothie it tasted great and was filling and satisfying
good product
this is the 3rd different brand i have tried and this one stands out  its greener tastes fresher and seems more aliveone small complaint and its very small is its a little hard to get the lumps out no big deal really  i just put about 12 cupcool water in a glass and stir in the barley and wheat grass i have to smash the lumps against the side of the glass butthis one tastes so alivei would not trade it
very practice and useful tool use it everyday
simple to use works awesome
i use it on sunglasses that do not have grip on the nose part it works just as advertised need to bring a few extra pairs during travel since at some point you may need to change them due to sunscreen usage continuous use with activities
needed for back pain and its been working just fine
as it turned out i have not used this product yet  it was suggested that i take it on a vacation but i encountered no blister problems  however another person borrowed it and said it helped their foot feel betterl  the blister never did fully develop
my dentist recommended this type of tooth brush i like the feeling of the brush on my sensitive mouth
perfect for my bedside comode
the oil doesnt absorb too quickly but i really like the scent and how it makes my skin feel the smell reminds me of sensual jasmine
awesome kit that i keep near me at all times i keep one in my belt and one in my bag at all times these things are literal lifesavers
works much better than i expected and i adore the handle i can reach everywhere
these ear plugs are great at keeping out noise but not so great for sleeping i find them a tad too hard of a plastic to be comfortable in my ears when laying on my sides i also find my ears itching a lot as well so i have no idea what sort of material these are made of but for sleeping no i would not purchase these again for outdoor work yes they would work just great if they didnt make your ears itch
these hanging witch were a fun addition to the house my wife picked up this one because it was so ugly it was cute she has a habit of doing that latelythese witches are pretty well made burlap makes the dress hat the hair feels like paint brush bristles but it works the faces are well painted and there is a decent amount of detail in the face hands and feet its all tied together with a bit of twine and there you go sit it on a broom with a welcome board attached like swing and there you have iti thought they were so great i bought her two more shes hung in our room they are have slightly  differentshades of burlap to separate one from the other but they made her smile and thats what i was going for i definitely recommend this for the its so ugly its cute person in your life enjoy
promagnetic closure works wellwell madegreat valueconscannot think of any 
this is a perfect addition to some walkers  comes with liner that can easily be cleaned up without having to remove the tray from the walker  however pay close attention to the product images    this will not work on all walkers  there must be a crossbar atnear the top of the walker for this to rest on when in service  there is a different version of this tray for those walker without the upper crossbar  this one wont work on most 34drive34 brand walkers but the other one called the 34pivot34 probably will
these help the bursitis in the elbows because they prevent you from accidentally hitting your elbow and feeling the pain
i got this because my physical therapist used it to hold my knee cap inplace while i exercised and made the knee stronger the cap had 34fallen off34 the track it is supposed to be on the tape  lasting about 3 days even in showers etc held strong and was placed below my knee cap as support and around under it  like a  lift  worked well after 23 weeks of usage and changing every 3 days the cap is in place now and no pain
best tongue scraper i have found and the company is super nice  would definitely purchase it again
not sure what kind of aliens we stole this material from but if you have an enamel tub and or tile shower especially white your first mission is to spray some tub cleaner and without letting it sit wipe it with a wet mr clean eraser and prepare to be amazed
i bought this for my husband and he raved about it uses it every day
as expected no concerns
it was a rainy windy day while i was loading my car with groceries from the cart  the cart took a slow turn and rubbed against the entire length of my passenger side audi  there was a black line that stretched from back to front  with light rubbing this product removed the marks  thank goodness
strong soft perfect size for me
i thought these would be perfect for selecting my favorite sneakers and playing golf in them you have to be careful what sneakers you use for this and anything with air bladders is not recommended due to puncturing and also your sneakers are design for a sure footed response with their current soles so when you add these cleats they can be very uncomfortable on your feet when the ground is hard and dry not so bad when its wet and soft overall i lost more than i would have liked and so i have to give these a clear thumbs down
good to add to my 1st aid kits
i travel and camp and this product makes life so much easier i can clean clothes on the go and carry this in my pocket
works great
when i make a mug of coffee if i dont use powdered mct oil then i use this handy dandy convenient single serve mct oil i still get my kick for my coffee it is an oil and it doesnt emulsify that easily but i just stir and drink and ignore any oil sitting on the top of my coffee
ok product low rating due to small loops on belt
it was good for a week and rthen it broke my son plays soccer and has longer hair he needed something to keep his hair out of his face and decided on these he is 11 and they did fit well the bad part was they started tearing after a week of use we did try  and they worked much better they are thicker and made from stretchable fabric we like these much better
this product has ingredients that support natural testosterone production and increase libido the effects are noticeable although i doubt my actual testosterone levels are increased significantly the noticeable effects are more likely due to increased dopaminesome of these ingredients you need to be careful of specifically the ldopa and dhea too much of these supplements can cause anxiety and aggression to my knowledge tribulus does nothing and it is the dominant ingredient the pills have a funky smell which is from the indole3carbinol i3c coverts to dim in your body and dim is in these as well which is redundantanother supplement that seems to work is daspartic acid but this is a bulk powder not a pillnone of these easilyavailable supplements will have a huge impact on your testosterone levels compared to more powerful compounds that are harder to buy but they should help slightlythe current price is 50 which is 083 per serving you might only want to take one pill at a time instead of three
stable high quality stand for the pelvis and spine  there was one review that said it was misleading because he thought it came with the pelvis  if you have been shopping for skeleton models most models cost over 100 dollars  this is a very good price for this stand
this mct oil powder taste ok it needs a few days to get used to it but eventually it works ok
great product just as described and the same thing as in stores
just get it not cheap but i see it as an investment on our health
i cannot remember to take it as required so no results to report but if this continues i will not re buy  thanks
appreciate quality products delivered to my door
these are not your typical gift bags  they are sturdy and can stand up to wear and tear they are not made of paper so they can be reused  in fact if youre giving them out your gift receipent can easily reuse them numerous times so they are ecofriendly i love how glittery they are and they come in a variety of colors  silver gold rose gold i love how they look and they are ideal for gifting small items like jewelry the only thing i didnt like was the gift tags  only one kind is offered thank you i wish they came with a variety of tags as it is they seem made only for thank you swag bagtype gifts
still have cat probs didnt work too good
seems to do what it is supposed to do
this is great i am going to physical therapy right now for knee pain the physical therapist uses one of these on my thighs and calves now i can do it from home or have my husband help i like the grips on this they are very comfortable the rollers are very smooth and dont balk its a perfect size for me to use on myself or for someone else to use on me disclaimer i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review
another spontaneous purchase based on recommendationfind it thoroughly useless  makes too much noise and after having it on for multiple days in a very small walk in closet i saw no improvement in quality of air whatsoeverthumbs down
a great alternative than using bleach tablets
my ability to put on some of my shoes is compromised by arthritis and other problems in my knees and back  this product has made shoes i quit wearing now fully available on a daily basis  this has been a fantastically useful tool for me when i want to wear shoes that do not have a stiff heel
case is well made and safely stores heady glassware at a bargain price
trying to use to cut my own hair  didnt work well  kept slipping
ok so its been 3 weeks and 4 days since ive been taking these breast pills i am seeing a difference but not in cup size im seeingfeeling a lot of firmness and more bouncewhen i touch my boobs they fill like they got bigger but when i look at my before picture i dont see a difference in size but just straight firmness i dont know but i will purchase one more bottle and see if i see a difference i mean if you want results you have to commit on taking them every dayi will for sure reveal the truth  to as if this product worksone thing i do hate are scammers i will be your proofall i know is that if this s dont work in a month i want my money back look for luz zuniga for me to keep you updated
love this product  received what was described and it worked perfectly  i will definitely order again
using alcohol and salt works just as well
material is a little cheap and unfortunately looks it its fine but isnt the best looking like the ombre color but thats a little cheap looking too
fits perfectly and i am a chunky gal holds the sensor in place i thought the green would be more tealish but it is a bright green not horrible though
now i can finally carry my epen with me and get to it fast case is made very nice and durable i love it
i have used this product for 20 years and its awesome  its great for the just got out of bed look and the sexy i didnt do anything to my hair to get it to look this cool look  and as i aged and my hair got thinner the tancho stick gave me the appearance of fuller thicker hair  its one of the strongest hair waxes ive ever found  the only thing i would change about this product is to have it without the lavender scent  people have come to associate this smell with me and i no longer smell it  however if i had the choice i would rather not smell like anything
this provided a nice relaxing bath i personally prefer traditional lavender scents this one smells more floral than lavendery it did bubble and fizz which created  an inviting bath
its a straw and as long as liquid comes up its good color is pretty too
fantastic cafe latte flavor mixes up smoothly tastes incredible i was disappointed to find that this contains sucralose better known as splenda which i do not prefer to consume but this tastes so good and packs enough of a nutritional punch i might overlook that very satisfyingan hour later woke up from a nap with a horrible taste in my mouth brushing my teeth wont get rid of it gaaah the artificial sweetener in this otherwise tasty product is just not acceptable which is really unfortunate i wish theyd either left it unsweetened or used plain sugar
prosi like the scentfeels like a highquality oili am able to sleep after using thisconscannot think of any 
could be just a tad larger  i have a small face and they just fit
i have been using the skidmore products for years and have had only superb success with it as an example years ago i bought a butcher block dining room table it had a natural light oiled finish something other than polyurethane i got the bright idea that i should recoat it with a popular semigloss polyurethane coating what a disaster it looked ok for a few months then went downhill from there probably something i did in error during application to be honest after looking at it for years i sanded off the poly and phoned the ownerinventor of the product who is more than willing to give one on one advice that is very nice got simple instructions and i followed them now the table literally looks better than the day i bought it this is great stuff for sure and a little goes a long way too i am absolutely not a carpenter or cabinet maker but this product makes me look like one you cant go wrong as long as you read and follow the instructions my highest recommendation
my daughter has some blood sugar issues that seem to be resulting in dry mouth this toothpaste has made a difference
this is a quick and efficient way to get rid of stains  it works very very well
great value and really nice sponge that has substance to it not just a piece of netting tied together
my wife uses it as our white noise machine for sleeping we hadhave a previous model that is about 15 years old my better half was afraid that it would die any day now knowing that she could not make it through the night without her machine we had to order a backupwe love it
i ordered a few mini snaps by mistake and was going to return them but decided to maybe get something to go with them  this bracelet is perfect  i have the large snap necklace so i have started collecting mini and large snaps
i am very pleased with this sponge the price is excellent the only issue i have is that it doesnt seem to lay the makeup into my skin as well as brushes or fingers i do not contour i just wanted something that would apply foundation faster than a brush its really easy to keep it clean and sanitary i would do 45 stars if i could i gave one to a friend and they are pleased
all of the liquid liposomal vitamin c products that ive reviewed have all had a strong flavor  not bad but some people might like to dilute in water or something i take it straight out of the bottle but the sweetened citrus flavoring is strong i most definitely prefer a liposomal form of vitamin c whether its capsules or liquid liposomal vitamin c stays in your system much longer than the water soluble ascorbic acid which is excreted quickly by the body liposomal means the ascorbic acid is wrapped in a fat blanket sunflower oil and is therefore carried much further and longer in your system fighting cold and flu viruses this bottle of liposomal vitamin c is nearly the same as all the others ive reviewed so theres a lot of them to choose from i can find nothing negative to say about this liquid liposomal vitamin c
i like these bath bombs they actually smell like cotton candy  really beautiful coloring in the bath water
would not recommend this are about as cheap of quality as i have ever seen in reading glasses  broke the first day
excellent blood pressure monitor no more spending money on batteries  charges quickly accurate like the battery operated monitors great price too very pleased
very good results with a pleasant scent  there are so many biting insects here at this time of the year when the monsoons are present  am not outside all day long as it is raining but while i am there and using this avon product the insects stay away  i can actually sit and watch the hummingbirds without being bothered  i am pleased with this lotion and have purchased a second one  would recommend
this stuff is great way better than any other brand even oxiclean highly recommend
it is a little hard to explain the feeling after using this it suppressed coughing for momentarily i didnt use it long enough to say it provided longlasting results my package came disheveled the salt package was open and salt was everywhere there was a tiny crack on the bottom of the inhaler watch out for that i contacted amazon and they refunded my money right away
not as good as the aquacel extra ag but these are much less expensive and work just fine on their own save the super pricey ones for mrsa and stuff
i started seeing a podiatrist about six months ago for horrible plantar fasciitis i purchased these powerstep protech insoles from his office for about 50 these are the same ones i got at his office and they are less than half the costthese are firm and great to add to any pair of shoes its important to note that they are covered in fabric which will wear if you wiggle your toes inside your shoes or if you put extra weight on one side my doctor said i would need to replace my insoles in one year ive actually needed a new pair for about two monthsso im glad ive found these i recommend getting properly fitted for the correct size and getting a proper diagnosis from a podiatrist as no insole is for every foot but im pretty happy i will definitely order these again
this product actually works i dont have back issues i am 130lbs and i do commercial construction i use to come home most of the nights with an achy back working plus wearing a tool belt with this product i havent had an achy back besides when i dont wear this product and its also half way decent its a bit bulky but to save the lower back its worth the sweat
where has this been all of my life this thing is awesome i used it tonight for the first time and it got all of my blackheads i first washed my face then used a hot wash cloth to open my pores then powered on the vacuum on the lowest speed and tada  nose chin and forehead is smooth and soft i recommend this to anyone who has larger pores andor trouble with blackheads you dont need to spend tons of money on one of these this one is decently priced and does the job effectively great purchase
great quality and price

this is a very cute item with a lot of great potential  the trees are adorable and made very well  the little clothes pins are so cute and come with one for each tree so there are no extras in case you lose one  it comes with burlap string so some assembly is required  the lettering is good but not perfect  the last letter s is coming off on my set and some of the letters are glued onto the trees a little crooked  the good thing was that while unpacking the trees they were in order so it was easy to assemble the words merry christmas quickly and easily
this set is made in china and does not have specific brand labeling  so it could be sold as any brand  for that reason youll want to look around to see who is offering the best price  i find the current price of twentyfour bucks to be quite expensive for plastic rods and brushes made in chinathe instructions show that you will probably want to use duct tape to secure each section together after you screw them together  this  is certain true as sections could unscrew as your working the brush backandforth   especially if using a drillyou may also wish to use super glue or some other glue to attach the brush head so that it does come unscrewedthe rods are not that flexible  the more rods you attach then the more curved it can become   but  if you that some tight turns then this may not workthis set comes with two brushes  the bristles are a good combination of flexible  stiff  the  brush is 4inches across and about 175 wide  the brushes must be used separately and can to be attached togetheri wish that someone would invent a dryer vent cleaner where you could attach some kind of hose to a vacuum cleaner  because once you use such a brush    youre going to have to get the lint out  if you have such a hose then you could possible attach it to this brush  pole set
great curling iron
smells nice but total ripoff 799 for a 25ozwhen you can get a 7oz bottle for a dollar more my fault shouldve read teh description plus the picture with all the bottles is misleading you would think you were getting 67 mini cans for 799 but again my fault
this is the best product ever made for mosquitoes and flying insects
over the years i have tried all sorts of conditioners creams serums  sprays  everything new that comes out  i am finished searching for the perfect repair serum this natural repair serum answers all of my problems frizz control  shine is important to me i  also color my hair so this serum helps with the dryness my hair looks shiny  healthy i love to read through the ingredients of natural oils i actually have heard of the oils and i have used the oils before to have these oils all together in one easy to use serum is great i did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion  this bottle will last quite a long time  ill let my friends try it also thank you
i use a lot of stain removers i have a puppy an older dog and older husband and myself we are all stain collectors for me just fixing a mug of coffee will result in coffee on my clothing a nice amount and if we go out to eat i will surely get something that falls on me from the transportation with a spoon or fork my husband always spills his food the dogs leave stains all over the furniture and the floor  especially the puppy he is about all done with going in the house but i dont trust him to always go in the back to go potty so we have stain removers and use them darn near every wash
this all around and only muffles slightly
other than the color i love it  really helps with pain
i have purchased professor amos drain cleaner for years  it has always worked  i may have to use more than one treatment but it will clear your drain
good product smells like curry
its so much nicer to take a shower with a scrubber brush like this one its really soft and feels amazing its really easy tohold onto even when wet its soft bristles provide a nice soft scrubbing massage to get derp down dirt off from skin the ability to reach hard to reach places makes it feel like you have superhuman stretchability great value
this is an ok performing toilet antiodor spray the scent is rather weak compared with other similar sprays ive used but it is reasonably strong its a generic floral scent  not all that different from a general air freshener type of scent but not bad its certainly better than the odor it helps mitigateas with other similar sprays you need to use it before the toilet is used for maximum effectiveness it has limited benefits if used after the toilet is used a fair amount is needed 4 or 5 sprays for good resultscompared with other similar products this is not as potent and just an average value at best three stars
great buy however note the expiration date on the are nearing much sooner than if you buy direct from dr gundry himself which is probably why its cheaper to buy on amazon says good for use upto 2 years beyond manufacturers expiration
we needed this little battery for our security system  could not find it anywhere  price is reasonable and i will be reordering more soon  if anyone needed this type of battery i would recommend this panasonic as it does last very long  we also changed out the battery in our fire alarms as it is very important to make sure your fire alarms are working for your safety
this is the best i will buy more when i run out
looks exactly how its pictureda little pricey but its nice
i bought this shower bench to be able to shave my legs or sit to take a shower when sick it looks great in my shower is the correct height for shaving legs and very sturdy
just needed the clip but it does not open
great toothbrush soft my dog tolerated it very well
these are nice files for the price they file well leave nails feeling smooth and theyre washable ive had them a few months now and my file hasnt dulled or lost strength excellent purchase
i bought two of these i have an expensive one at home and needed something smaller and less money for work and for when i travel though it may not be as powerful as my expensive one at home it does the job i keep the one at work in a cosmetic bag with toothpaste toothbrush and a small mouthwash and its perfect to tote to the restroom after lunch and keeping my teeth clean the other is in my travel cosmetic case so when i go out of town  i just charge it up and off i go for 999 you cant beat the price
im a big fan of generic stuff including tissues until i actually have a cold and then i want the real deal  kleenex these are just softer and smoother with no shedding compared to the off brands sneezing or just a runny nose means lots of tissues and these do not make your nose sore this 8 box batch means we can keep them handy in every room
it is what a expected scent isnt very strong but it coats well and does the job keep it in plastic bag so it doesnt  dry out glad to not be buying plastic throw always will buy again but waiting to see how long this will last so far good over a few weeks
order the ones for fingers and toes got the ones for toes only  returning
i need the natural skin healing for my eczema spots that will itch and be noticeable if i didnt have clothes over them but then you have to itch through your clothing i can use this on my face for the scales and also on my body double duty smells good too
i really like these wipes theyre small i keep a package in my car and work great to clean up your face or other parts not just for kids  
dont waste your money if looked great when i received it but it wont fit on any of my cabinets
i didnt really know what i was getting into ive been discovering all sorts of new beauty and health tools  mostly good  and was especially excited to see this might help my hair i didnt really know what i was getting into here thankfully i read the instruction manual before starting and saw the warning about using this if you have metallic implants i messaged eternal clear and received a speedy response that it was safe to use this as long as i stayed 15 away from my metal rods yayso i had already noted that everything arrived safely neatly boxed and sealed i was worried the bulbs were defective at first because they didnt light up right away i wasnt even sure if they were supposed to but i persisted and eventually they all lit up i dont know if it was a coincidence but one finally lit up when i moved my hand closer toward it they all seemed to light up much easier after the first time the electric buzzing and smell is kind of scary but as soon as i was told i could proceed i plucked up the courage to try this on the lowest setting im not even sure it was a setting because theres a pretty wide range between on and where the dots indicating intensity start im slowly working on getting used to the sounds smells and feel first i found the dial easy to turn im proceeding cautiously but optimistically
my favorite of all the wen i tried
very difficult to use very hard to get out of the tube a caulking gun would have been easier
very thin does not feel the same as brand name
look no more red nose but no more money for the love of tissues please
easy to install and easy to cleangood value
i have ordered these twice and really like the soft packaging  it is perfect for the car and any other place in the house the quality is great and the price is great
a little confusing to maneuver
bought the dogthemed matches for friends bought these matches for myself  cutethe matches themselves are low quality but the dressedforsuccess cats are purrrfect meow
my son loves it good taste
i initially was concerned after opening the package when i realized that this device is intended for the outflow port from an hvac system while many people have the vac portion of the hvac system my house is equipped just with the hv  heating and ventilationafter looking at my setup a bit and pondering i reached out to the manufacturer mammoth and asked for some guidance on installing into my systemafter sending some pictures back and forth we came up with a good solution to attach the unit to the sidewall of one of the heating unit which would purify anything entering into the systemthe quality of the parts are great  the lights give a satisfying sound when connecting to their receptors and the status lights that indicate when it is safe to service the equipment or not are a great added benefitthe included template for cutting into your system is very important as without it this task would be substantially harder
great item cleans your contacts really good
item as described good cleaning item
i love this product as a night moisturizer takes a jiffy to get the amount right but it is so absorbable its really not an issue think you will love it
makes good party joints almost two zigzag papers long  too long for my daily use and no extra belt like the smaller raw rollers but a fine machine none the less  colorado approved
this set has all the basic scents to get you started you can use the different scents and blend them to make your own scent to have in your home many people use these in the humidity type diffuser and others use the diffuser that does not use water i dont use water and i get some times scents in my home
great product
bought for a xmas present and she loves them
the rice was delicious
super cute and be warned that these are a bit time consuming to put together but well worth the time

indoor air quality has become of the utmost importance these days most people want to do everything they can to keep their homes safe this gadget is a novel approach it uses uvc light to sanitize the air in your home via the hvac system its something that can be used in combination with an air filter to improve the air quality in your home the unit is small and easy to install the bulbs can be replaced when they die i think this is an excellent invention i highly recommend itthanks so much for taking the time to read this review  i hope the information that ive provided helps make your decision a little easier
worked twice second time wouldnt even come on for five minutes so it really worked once then no lights no heat made in china garbage  in the process of moving i dont have a printer to return so this is beyond inconvenient and with a stiff neck running to print labels and return second time this weeki guess im just frustrated with being the best nation on the earth and having the crappiest products on the planet because of china and the terribke deals we have made in this county im done shopping online because of this
this is a really coollooking shaver my son is into skulls and thinks this is the neatest thing ever he says all of the shaving and trimming functions work quite well which was a bit unexpected for a seemingly novelty device but when it comes to the brushes they dont clip into the base and stay there therefore once turned on they can fall out at any time the instructions do say to attach the brushes place them against your face and then turn the shaver on so maybe they are just held on by pressure the instruction booklet is a good size and readable which is a plus in my bookaside from the brushes not snapping into the shaver as all the other attachments do this shaver looks cool and also functions very well i would definitely recommend it especially for skull lovers and teenage boys just starting out shaving 4 stars 
great teeth  gums supplement  after only 4 days use my gums are pink  redness has cleared up i like the clove taste  numbing effect teeth feel stronger  set firm in gums too they seem to be whiter even tho i drink coffee  tea yay 
i was expecting a three pack from the picturenote to self always read what is included especially since this indicated 90 capsules and that is what i got i got to this review too late in the day to try it but tomorrow morningwatch out i am back and it is the next day i took the diet capsule and now waiting to see if it curbs my appetite
flavor is the first criteria i review when reviewing energy drinks and i have reviewed a lot of them  its still too much on the sweet side but almost all of them are  i dont know why they have to be so sweet i usually add limelemon juice to them to cut the sweet  that said i play two hard sets of singles yesterday in the hot sun and had my water bottle filled with this energy booster  i felt ok for the most part playing in the sun really saps my energy so knowing that i was still going pretty strong towards the end of the match tells me this stuff must be helping
this is basically a heated pad with a removable shield to keep the heat in it looks like carpet in the pictures but its a plastic like material thats not a bad thing since its easy to wipe off but i wanted to note that its not a soft carpet the heat is concentrated in the center of the mat but my feet stay warm on the edges too with the shield on its a welcome addition to my chilly office
from what i have heard described about other rolling machines of this type they break easily  this one which is made of hemp plastic i am sure will last a very long time and its very easy to uselove it
this double sided brush is decent for dogs my only issue is that after a few weeks the bristles start coming out it is not a very durable brush
steps are clearly numbered and stated on the items so there is no confusion or mistakes best i have owned
was hesitant to buy cordless as my other cordless esp for cats didnt cut through mats easily  by the time i pulled his hair 2 or 3 times he bit showing his irritationand then i was irritated too  this holdog cordless pet hair clipper came today and my cat was been quickly dematted  it had a 60 charge and i waited a couple minutes to get 100 charged very quickly  i love the lcd display  the blade was easy to take off and reassemble so i oiled and cleaned the clipper before and after use  this time i got a kitty kiss  we are both happy love it  and for the price amazing
took care of arm pain nerves that was result of shingles  was able to go to sleep
good cotton balls used mainly for removing nail polish  they held together well
worked great
didnt mean to order this but im glad i did works as advertised i like that it folds around my straighter too chi approved
this package came with two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam ear plugs one sleep mask is black on both sides and the other has purple on one side and black on the other  the fabric is smooth and soft against the skin the elastic band that holds the mask on is doubled over and is adjusted by sliding the fastener rather than with a bulky snap or velco closure i find this closureadjustment method more comfortable than my current sleep mask the mask is thick enough to block light and the mask does narrow as in has a cut out in the nose area for a somewhat better fit but there is no molding or pillowed area to hold the mask above your eyes or fill the gap created between the cheek and the nose so light does get under the mask the mask lies directly against my eyelashes and i dont really care for that the stitching is neatthe mask measures 85 across by 4 high or 35 high where it dips up at the nose area the elastic can be adjusted between about 8 to 15 of length for a total mask  elastic length of 165 to 235
this smells different than their other dreft ive got in the past and i love the update it smells so good and not too intense the box reduces plastic waste and is recyclable easier and more convenient to use than a pour plastic bottle just a warning to turn and open the spout slow because it will come out fast if not ive been using this on our daughters clothes and cloth diapers and it cleans very well and makes everything smell great
i cant tell you how much i appreciate the wide flat bases of these ziplocs i like to make ahead and freeze meals and its often awkward to fill them without someone else holding them open these stand up by themselves and make it so much easier love them
as many others have said these are 2 oz cups theyre also poorly packaged  just shrink wrapped so at least a dozen are crushed or otherwise damagedpity because theyre a cute pattern might keep havent decided yet
this is a great quality brush that i got to make the difficult  job of straightening my daughters hair  now it is a little less of a chore for us both this is easy to use and does a nice job in half the time and alot less fuss from my child it can be a bit of a problem when she wants to play and not sit to have it taken care of for any length of time this is a nice way to get her hair done quickly and painlessly so we are both happy it works so well and does a great job it gets hot fast which is great no one wants to sit waiting the handle stays cool so i dont have to worry about my hand burning while i am doing her hair the controls are easy to use and the directions explained everything thoroughly the screen is easy to read her hair brushed right through and it didnt take long for it to look smoother and straight this is a great brush that does a good job i am so glad i found iti was given this brush in exchange for an honest review
no instructions i have no clue what those handle things are for however i did use the stickies to keep the balloons holding together and the long ballon holder
ive purchased for international s america and vietnam travel  when it pours the lotion separates from the insect oil and i have a tough time getting to two to meld
this product made my wifes legs go numb
my wife has major knee issues  i purchased this and installed per instructions  if youre a handy man type this will pose no problem for the installation  the white color matched the white porcelain of the toilet  the base of the toto drake is longer than toilevators 223 inch length and extends off the platform 1 inch in the back  it doesnt effect stability  i know it can hold just over 300 lbs without structural failure in the 2 months we have had iti purchased the item because there were no ada or otherwise round toilets available 35 taller than the drake and this toto has been great operationally and for longevity of parts  with the toilevators 35 lift i kept my original toilet and my wifes knees are much easier to extend when she stands up  i was rather concerned about the weight but it said 500 lbs was the limit  it has proved sound  it has been easy to clean  the toilet hasnt shifted or slid on the base  the bolts extended higher than the top of the toto toilet base  i just purchased a deep cap rather than cut them  all needed items are in the kit except for the deeper bolt cap covers  i also needed a new bowl gasket seals the tank to the bowl as i took off the tank to make handling much easier for methe only issue for me were the closet bolts that were supplied these connect the toilet base and the toilevator to the sewer flange at the floor  the heads of the bolts were round not flat and appeared to be galvanized  they should be stainless steel  they would not fit under the flange  i simply ground the head and sides down a bit till they fit and applied plumbers grease to the threads to prevent the bolt and nut becoming rusted together  years of experience have taught me to think ahead
these insoles are made from eva they are not as durable and give less cushioning than insoles made from polyurethane the insoles i received were much larger than my shoes so i had to trim them down which is a hassle compared to insoles that are properly sized
very comfortable and soft
i love the glitter the mask is comfortable and light enough so its not overwhelming i wear it to my doctors appointments if they are not virtual anywhere i need to go it is appropriate and cute
3 years later there is a leak
fit my device and now i can charge it woohoo
review after one week of use had some doubts that this would work as well as stated for the incredible task  at hand  a laundry room that is the nighttime spot for 3 dogs every morning we open the door and gasp at the horror of the stench a good thorough mopping might clean the floor but the air is rank with stinky dog that no aerosol air freshener can conquer plugged this in as soon as it arrived and within an hour it was pleasant even when the pack comes in wet it has made a big difference now to see how long it lastsupdate after a month the dogs are winning it no longer clears out the smell the way it did in the beginning if my laundry room were bigger id purchase another larger unit like the one we use for the whole house maybe that would work for now we might just have to invest in face masks
i got these to wear to my chemo time they are super soft around the eyes they wrap around and velcro keeping the maximum amount of light out so i can sleep i am so very happy i found these my friend recommended a memory foam style and i never thought of it so i was excited to buy them overall great comfort great sleep quality and very soft on eyes i highly recommend these to anyone
these innocheer 2434 wind chimes with s hook are literally music to my ears i love the sound that they make i moved them earlier today on my front porch so that they would be closer to my bedroom they sound like christmas music to me and such a pretty sound at thati would buy again
i did not attend my expectations  it did not make my feet smooth at all  the motor sounds very cheap  im in the process of returning this product
this really gives a nice stretch  i use it on my office chair daily  ever since i started using this the lower back pain i would have at the end of the day is gone
we are big fans of this flavor and the coconut wish they were less expensive but they arent
i use this form of curcumin more for its ability to cross the bloodbrain barrier neuro protective having said this i also find it to be an excellent antiinflammatory
these are great  best i found so far
this is the biggest piece oh shiiiiiiii i ever bought  it does not even work
i love that this has a sturdy stand and wheels they roll very easy the drying power is very good it dries up rather than down which i think dries the hair faster it was easy to assemble very professional type dryer
great nail file  the 34sand34 doesnt rub off  this is good quality
saw one bottle sitting on a shelf bought it to try out since i get dry mouthed at night but dont want to drink anything this worked well and i just ordered 3 more bottles
ive only taken it about 4 days and can already tell the difference  thank you
nice product but over priced i found it at a big box store for half the price
reading all these reviews and they look and read like the same reviewer dont ya think strange  sobe cautious
cannot get the protector off the brush going to have to send it back
the first time i ordered these i fell in love with them because they where perfect for work but this second time around i found it be a different type of glove as if they changed the product it felted and a different color
i love these bars  they are a bit chewy and can get really hard if theyre cold but i still give them 5 stars bc they are one of the best egg free paleo bars on the market
my posture is excellenteveryone says so smile including multiple physical therapists but i began to have some irritation in my clavicle collar bone area and a new curved car seat back was killing me combined  just awful this gentle posture corrector helps hold my shoulders back thats retraining my back muscles and relieving both issues its easy to don and very adjustable comfortable remember only 30 minutes at a timeespecially to start
i love these nail files as they are the only ones that i will use  thank you so much
i bought hoping to block husband snoring which didnt help well with that  but took with me on a plane ride and it work amazing keeping light from overhead plus helped with using to try to rest
that strap on the back really makes masks stay on better and feel more comfortable but the little cup insert thing didnt really work for me i think you have to have a much smaller than average nose and im not sure this is designed for americans also it doesnt really stay in place but the straps and lanyard thing or useful the rest depends on your facethat strap on the back really makes masks stay on better and feel more comfortable but the little cup insert thing didnt really work for me i think you have to have a much smaller than average nose and im not sure this is designed for americans also it doesnt really stay in place but the straps and lanyard thing or useful the rest depends on your face
better then 300 dollars a box
taste nothing like salted caramel it is nasty tasting and i have tasted way better flavors of whey then this i am a caramel fanatic when i am looking for a good whey that doesnt have hidden sugars and was disappointed that i spent 50 flats on something i expected a way better taste i have to down this drink pretty fast because its not anything i can discribe just not caramel of any means dont waste your money extend has a better flavor then this brand of carmel and you get way more for your money
its heavy duty works well in the kitchen any surfaces that needs cleaning
these suffice for the small amounts of trash i generate the size is good for small to med waste cans the price was right and delivery was fast they do tear easily if heavy or sharp objects are put in
i filled up the soap container and it was very hard to squeeze it out so i just put the soap on the brush and showered that way i like the brush part soft and felt like it was getting the dry skin off but didnt like the fact that the liquid soap was hard to squeeze out it is okay but not as easy as it says in the ad i bought the three pack so i wont be buying it again
like the title says i stuck them to the back of a pair of boots with worn soles to restore traction  there was a maximum area for the pad to adhere and i carefully cleaned and slightly roughened the area to maximize its ability to stickafter just a single wear the pads were starting to come off and after 2 they were completely gone  while they were cheap they were a total waste of money
maca powder is a superfood from peru you can mix some of the powder in your smoothies and you can also add some to your baking it is good for giving you endurance it is very nutritious but also has 20 grams of carbohydrates per serving
we have several similar products in the house  during this covid19 we try to take our vitamins and stay hydrated  this is a very nice item to have around  my wife and i are actually both drinking one nowmy biggest complaint is the salty taste  i know i know it has salt for electrolytes but my other main one we drink doesnt have this salty taste  i just chugged half the bottle and then refilled it with cold water  i like it better when it is diluted  next time i will just use 12 of one tube in my bottle of wateri do appreciate the vitamins and will continue to use this
i really like the idea of this device the vibrations themselves are soothing but because i purchased this to help with long haul covid issues which stem to my understanding at issues with nervous system regulation i didnt consider the fact that one of my symptoms is scalp pain and when im experiencing the scalp pain the location of this device can be somewhat aggravating in addition i had a hard time getting it to rest comfortably behind my ears it had a tendency to move off of my left ear in particular im not sure if its not as suited to certain headear shapesi did find the vibrations to be comforting but it was offset by the discomfort of the pressure on my head aggravated by long haul scalp pain and proclivity to headachesanother issue was that for a product like this i would like to use it more than 2x a day one charge lasts about 4 sessions so it requires frequent recharging if you want to use it more regularly and also using it more regularly i felt more discomfort from the pressure on my headears so not an ideal device for frequent usei only ended up using it a few days before deciding to return i really like the idea and i did enjoy the sensation of the vibration but it wasnt wellsuited for my needs at this time
love it so fresh and coconut is wonderful
if you know and love sangre de grado this is a good one
supplements were a great deal cheaper than the local nutrition store  plan to order again in the future  no complaints at all but just so everyone knows amino acids taste terrible  they also give you terrible breathe while youre eatingdrinking it  just a heads up i wasnt aware of this until after i started them
i have only used the high heel pad for the front of my feet and they were amazing so comfortable heels that i couldnt wear for more than an hour i wore all night
these are the best nail files and buffers to use i am a nail tech and i always use these files since i can clean them after i am done using them and put them in my clients individual tool containers love them a must buy make sure you prep the edges of the files before using them on your clients or on your self since you can cause cuts since they are sharp
although not the most durable it did the job  but if you plan on mailing items using this i wouldnt get this  if its just for gifts that you will transport locally or at your home then it does a decent job
my right foot has a bunion growing bigger and have been looking for something to help ease the pain this bunion corrector does okay but by it being so squishy it isnt really correcting anything all it does is provide a cushion between my big toe and second toe ive turned it go horizontal between my toes and that seems to help better still on a hunt to find something other than surgery to correct iti received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
probiotics are important for digestion and immune health  but they can get pricey  these are reasonably priced and seem to work the same as my regular brand
pain in my limbs have greatly lessened  from taking this  i can finally enjoy walking again
very impressed with this stop and squat foot stool it is made of great quality plastic that is sturdy and has a decent weight to it it is great for people who are shorter than 6 feet and really uncomfortable for someone taller i am 55quot and it works great for me my significant other is 61quot and finds it really hard to use it allows me to have a productive bowel movement and it takes some adjusting for your intestines to understand what is going on lol but i am happy with it and recommend to those who want to have a bm the way man was supposed to have it there is a gap in the middle for you to line it up evenly in front of the toilet great bathroom experience nonethelessi received a free product for the purpose of my review opinions are 100 my own
ive used it twice on wet feet and it works perfectly at getting dead skin off and smoothing 
niftalicious
ok doesnt straighten curly hair completely
love these things cant live without them  others have posted they dont work but it takes at least a couple months of constant use to get the full benefit ive tried many other tabs for my joints and will not go back to anything else these make me able to move and not be in such constant knee pain
i love this my son is autistic and so it is a great sensory bath toy for him he loves to hold it and feel it its really flexible as well and he likes when i rub his back with it a great buy
according to the manufacturer fresh aid toothpaste is packed with quality ingredients that target gum diseases like gingivitis and plaque it prevents tooth decay and gum and tooth pain its also the best toothpaste for those with sensitive teeth and gumsthis toothpaste has ginger root extract which i can taste and may partially account for the tingling sensation that stays on after you rinse your mouth out the toothpaste has a yellowish color and kind of reminds me of lemon filling it leaves your mouth feeling fairly clean but there is a lightness to this toothpaste that other white and chalky toothpastes like crest dont havei question whether the lack of fluoride will be effective in the longterm at protecting my recessed gums and preventing plaque from taking hold i usually use colgate total so only time will tell if this toothpaste will be as effective i have been brushing it now for only a week so i will update this review if anything changes for now its an ok toothpaste for those who are concerned with the amount of chemicals in their toothpaste because of my gum issues effectiveness is more of a priority for me so if you have overall healthy teeth and gums you may love it
this product is easy to use and leaves my granite countertops very shiny and looking great  it also has a nice clean smell  simply spray it on and rub with a dry cloth  the can lasts a very long time and it is a great value
just like all the other comments that i did not listen to the liquid will never go through this tube it wont work
this is a very nice modern scale  it take 4 aaa batteries and were easily installed in the scale  this is a very nice scale and it looks great in my bathroom  love the glass  seems to be accurate when it comes to weighing on it  overall i am very satisfied with this scale  it has met my expectations and does not look cheapi received this scale for free for testing and reviewing purposes  this is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to this conclusion by using the scale myself
my family constantly has problems with ear wax build up it seems like im constantly cleaning them i got this product in hopes of making it a little less scary than scooping it out it does an okay job  i think i need to work with it more to figure it out  bottle worked as advertised
seems to put more of a strain on the oral b to move the brushes than the factory brushes  i think i well go backto the oral b
ive been using the aria for about a month now and im really pleased with it i like that it takes a new measurement every time you step on ive had some scales in the past that didnt seem to budge unless you lost or gained a pound or two and sometimes that big jump was quite unwelcome it measures quickly identifies me and syncs right to my fitbit account immediately i was initially concerned because the bathroom that it is located in has the worst wifi connection in my whole house but so far i havent missed a single reading on itthe bodyfat  definitely does fluctuate but as im familiar with other devices that measure bodyfat i also know that things as simple as whether your stomach is empty or full and how dehydrated you are can cause this to fluctuate quite a bit the percentage itself might not be extremely accurate but if you weigh yourself at the same time and under similar circumstances daily ie first thing in the morning before youve eaten or had anything to drink then it is accurate enough to let you know whether your percentage is increasing or decreasing over time this isnt a professional bodyfat measuring tool and its unreasonable to expect it to work as well as oneim the only one currently using my scale so i cant comment on the difficulties some people have with multiple users or guest users setting it up was extremely simple and now i dont have to wonder if i remembered to log my weight in my fitbit account or not in fact now i cant do things like 34forget34 to log my weight after a rough weekend i like to know where im at on my journey so i dont find myself avoiding getting on the scale to avoid having the weight logged which i was actually worried about overall it has just become a comfortable part of my routine and caused me to have to be a bit more accountable to myself im quite happy with my aria
i have been using it and has a nice flavor very effective
given as a gift much appreciated and comfy for patient
it was a gift they loved it
no do not use magic erasers on anything i cant believe they are even still selling any of these things they serve no purpose and will damage anything they touch if you care about the surface you are about to clean keep these things away or the surface will be damaged
these adult diapers are soft and comfortable to wear also quite absorbent  my only issue is that the cute design looks like baby diapers
not the same as the picture
this are super colorful great gift giving holiday bags and tags i always give smaller gifts to neighbors sometimes home made baked goods sometimes a bottle of wine these bags are perfect for this the drawstring is made of ribbon and seals the bag well these would also be great for packaging teachers gifts or for family gifting highly recommend nice variety nice colors

i just cant seem to wear any other type of nose pads than these selfadhesive soft pads i have tried at least 5 or 6 other kinds and i always come back to these they are so much more comfortable on the nose and i have a very small nose bridge these come in different colors and have been the only ones worth the expense
i like these bags they do clear odors in  enclosed spaces
i am not going to be ugly  but this was the worse 900 i have spent and that is all i have to say about it
ive bought several of these kits and i finally figured out why this isnt working for me a lot of the breakfasts and lunches are very sugary bars which later make me feel like im starving  i think its the sugar for one thing a granola bar in my opinion is a pretty lousy breakfast or lunch not very filling and not much nutrition then after you eat these you crash from the sugar high and are starving i ended up eating eggs on the days that i was supposed to have the bars and i have bars left over weight loss was zero  i lost on nutrisystem before but that was when they had artificial sweeteners for those who want to know this is low fat low calorie high carb high sugar  i do like most of the dinners
last minute gift for a 15 year old hockey fan arrived on time  he appeared happy cant comment on the game as we did not play
while its not a new neck it does help keep the existing one freer from strain and tension it fits right at the bend of the neck and if you lay on it regularly it helps ease shoulder tension i put it on the floor and just relax into it and it works the best if im trying to watch tv or something it doesnt have the same effect but just relaxing or listening to an audiobook music podcast its very effective
bought as part of a gift for a soap making kit and it was well received a little bit makes a lot of soap so this was a great valueupdate still 5 stars made soap regularly for 6 months with these before finally having to order more fantastic lather and has made great soaps
exactly what i expected thanks
nice strong pumpi have two one purched from here and one from another online vendor moves more coolant than i had anticipated right now i have the pump maxed but i will be taking it down to a lower setting i dont need the flow that it is set on now i have two of the pumps tied in a series using the koolance rp452x2 dual 52534 reservoir had a aio pump die on me in the past so this series setup should allow for redundancy
unfortunately it did not remove the odor as i had hoped
i use only 14 to 12 tsp if i have leg cramps this works the best my dad had hand cramps and within 15 mins of giving him 12 tsp the cramps were gone i love that i can vary the dose  check out dr carolyn dean
loved the variety
please use vinegar for weeds and not poison  as a cancer surviver i would never use poison when vinegarworks  i add dishsoap also and it works great  spray when weeds are small and you use much less product and nip it in the bud before weeds get out of hand  i always use vinegar 30 straight with added dishsoap perfect safe and simple
best natural 0calorie sweetener out there imho  absolutely no aftertaste and tastes just like regular sugar  it can be cooked with but if the item is something like a jam best to add at the end of cooking  with baking youre supposed to add 14 more but i like it a bit less sweet so just add the amount in the recipe  perfect for adding to dry cereal
looking forward to using these with our cloth diapers  durable and waterproofrevised review we have been using these for awhile and they are wonderful the drawstrings arent super helpful but we dont need to use them that way amazing quality and great use we are nearly a year in
perfect size leaves residue on hands after handling

the mats are very easy to use they fit together and separate with ease  the thickness is great my pins do not poke through  they also allow for very fast drying time overall these are excellent
ive used quite a few keto supplements and this one is nasty i could hardly even get it down didnt bother drinking another one its really bad and didnt get the energy the same as the ptks disappointed
i cant remember the last time a purchase made me this happy doesnt matter what season it is my feet develop thick calluses and crack open and bleed not just on the heels  i have used all manner of graters sponges files microplanes etc and while they make my feet smoother i cant get rid of the calluses  the emjoi did what all of those other methods could never accomplish  my feet are indeed smooth and soft after using it just a couple of times  and oddly enough even though it took the calluses down more completely than the other methods it seemed to be gentler on my skin than the other tools which often left me with sore or bleeding feet  i will sing emjois praises from the rooftops lol
works really well  one application was all i needed for a pair of older stinky sneakers  will definitely buy again
after trying a ton of different metal nail files these are the only nail files i buy
i love this thing i have a messed up foot from a call several months ago and this really helps when it gets tight or painful the pressure is greati vary it depending on needs i use it approximately once a day and have had no problems i use the heat occasionally and it is meh
this is useless  you have to place your entire mouth over the opening and then exhale  i dont see how you could use this while driving or anythingelse
i hate how so many supplements use artificial sweeteners that make everything so sickeningly sweet this protein powder is actually not as sweet as many that ive tried definitely more of a natural amount of sweetness that i really appreciate tastes just like a sweetened creamy latte i add this to my morning coffee and its just perfectthis doesnt state whether it has caffeine in it or not but i dont believe it does despite the cold brew flavorthe reason i took a star off was the packaging i was super excited to receive a bagged protein powder because the super large and usually half empty containers of protein powders take up so much counter space unfortunately it just doesnt seal back up very well did not feel air tight at all i didnt want it to lose freshness so i just put it in a different container wish the sealing strip had worked better
heavy duty caps fit tight could be larger
this tiny pill is super easy to swallow and doesnt contain ingredients that would exclude its use for people with celiac disease or dairy or soy sensitivities though it didnt mention anything about being vegetarian they are also chewable
dmso is a carrier product to be applied on clean skin away from cut sores and only to be used externallyapply a little with sterile cotton let dry and apply ie icy hot or pain medicine may give a licorice taste in mouththis should only used for severe pain check with your health care provider
best deal  will buy again
got  the clay model and i found it very difficult to warm in my small microwave  ive got a turntable and this wrap is large and difficult to pack inside you end up having to fold it over and then it never heats evenly  once i did get it warm enough it was awkward to wear because the weight it at the bottom so it ends up pulling downward and  choking youthere is a rather flimsy strip of velcro that is supposed to hold it together but it looked like an amateur job i expected this to be much nicer based on reviews i had read
this is giving me alot of relief on my back and legs dont fall asleep
i have referred this product to many clients  all of thiers have worked very well unfortunately mine has never worked  the company has not responded to my calls to ask questions
slow results strong chemicals
been taking this stuff daily for a couple of months and have noticed a sizable difference in the reduction of lower legcalf cramps from what ive found this is the only supplement where you can get 1000mg of potassium in one scoop otherwise it is sold in 50mg pills which would take forever to get to the minimum recommended 3500mg a day and you need more if you are nursingi put this in with about 14 cup warmed water 30 sec in microwave  it seems to dissolve better in warm water and then i mix it in with 20 oz of flavored water it does alter the flavor a bit but you get used to it
these have a great taste but after about 2030 minutes i have the nasties belches cant say if they are working but i am still taking them
i take this for sleep regular bowel movements along with one dulcolax every now and then since i have diabetes and my bowel has slowed down i take two every night and it really helps the heart read up about magnesium it helps a lot of things including muscle cramps
does it work probably notdid it have some placebo effect maybe a littlewould i buy it again definitely notthanks for coming to my ted talk
the only cleaning solution to use
love using these on my contacts they always feel so refreshed in the morning
works great  very easy to use
nice product but the extended button causes it to pop open in my pocket a lot oh well
i bought this to catch the few stray hairs missed by several rounds of laser hair removal on my legs the epilator requires multiple passes on some patches i feel it pulling but it doesnt get everything i havent used an epilator since the 1980s so im not sure if this is how they all are or if this one is weak in any case having the electric razor option is nice for the few i cant get i have also tried the heel sander on my feet seems okay but i didnt buy it for that
i love my little witchshe is perfect
thank god they make a liquid version of astaxanthin my husband can not swallow pills and this is the only liquid astaxanthin i have found antwhere its pricey but its the only one around so we continue to buy it astaxanthin is very good for your health its a super antioxidant wish they made a chewable gummy for kids we take our astaxanthin daily as part of our everyday supplements my husband has not complained of any taste aversioni mix this in with his liquid fish oil and add it all to a small shot glass of juicehe drinks it every morning poor guy but what can you do when he cant swallow pills he doesnt complain just drinks it down
i love the portability of the individual days of this pill case attache it is great for 2xs per day doses however i have a few dislikesloves each day is portable each side is large enough to hold about10 pills as long as they are not super large i find it easy to fill the pu carrying case makes the pill compartments easy to carry dislikes the pill cases are tightly enclosed in the case making it a bit difficult to remove each day there is no am pm written on each cell instead there is a moon and sun the days written on the side of the case are only one one side since the cells move around in the case the day of the week is not always visiblein summary even though this is large i like that each circular day container can be taken in a purse for one day and there is no need to take the entire container they also hold a sufficient amount of pills for me unfortunately my dislikes have me rating this case 3 stars the current price of 1099 is reasonable for this and a lot cheaper than the same case in black that is 5 more by another vendor
very happy with this  i spent a lot of money 3 years ago for a teak bench which eventually rotted out and took up too much space in my tiny shower stall anyway  this is lightweight and comfortable i can shave my legs  probably best for younger folks not afraid of falls  a frail person should seek something sturdier but it is exactly what i needed
i bought 2 in different colors  one holds a nebulizer and all its parts in one place  the other holds personal home medical equipment  no more bulky boxes  the different colors helps separate things  and family members can easily find home medical supplies

im doing a 5x5 stronglifts program and my squat weight is getting pretty heavy for me i weigh 185 and probably around 240 i started to feel a little pain in my knee at the bottom of my lift nothing super bad but just a little instability if that makes sense anyway these things are amazing they provide that little bit of compressions that just makes everything feel right im up to 260 now and squatting 45 times a week super nice product cant go wrong i also used their sizing chart and it worked perfect went with the large for my 15in pattela measured right around the center of my knee with my leg straight
shaves well  the first one i ordered stopped working after 5 months of use however the seller was kind enough to provide a replacement
works as expected
this is exactly what i was looking for and what a great price  these were much more expensive in the store
cheaply made
perfect i bought these on the recommendation of kelly starrett from his book ready to runthey are exactly what i wanted sturdy and well made
since we are at 6 million deaths as of today precaution prevails these are great for slipping inside of decent paper masks and probably regular ones i dont know but i put them inside of paper masks when i dont feel like messing around with heavier cloth ones for example at the hair stylist my only complaint is that is actually a compliment they have a little bit of stickiness to the edges so occasionally youll peel them off your face but ive yet to break out or had any residue but i find an unobtrusive and living in a building with long hallways fire doors and non maskers its better to be safe than sorry i can recommend
great scent to the deodorant but this brand was not a good match for my skin type resulting in regular breakouts in my underarms i dont normally have sensitive skin  never had issues with deodorant or antiperspirants in the past
these masks are in my opinion as effective as standard n95 masks and at least as comfortable to wear they foldup very nearly and tend to last me about a week each the ear strings are comfortable and stretch easily theyre a bit sharp on the back of my ears but not unbearably

this body wash smells wonderful the foam makes it feel luxurious too
all of the ingredients in this combination are well thought out and researched and patented potent forms of them are included there is no magnesium stearate etc in the capsules i find that this combination helps keep me focused and yet less stressed sometimes i take in the evening but its equally good in the morning the cost is relatively high for 2 capsuleday use but during a particularly stressful period it is worth it i find taking 1day works for me but my body weight is not much over 100
have to have helps with copd
love this product and that its offered on amazon
honestly idk what im doing wrong but once i put it in it just stays in place with no effort on my part no matter which one or two i use so didnt work for me

i have used and loved this product for years but it was a little green pill  didnt notice when i ordered but these new ones are capsules  they dont seem to work as well for me and wonder if the ingredients have changed
this is a feels review and as such you should seriously question the results my name is paul ive been diagnosed with vitamin d so low it wins limbo contests i have been on various vitamin ds for years every time i get my blood tested its low every doctors like oh well take 5000 a day youll get it back up in no time and for the past 15 years or so ive been taking more than that daily i just burn right through iti also get severe insomnia if i take it later in the day thats generally how i know its working as i have absolutely no method of testing whether this worked other than the feels i took it later in the day than i normally would my globule d3 dose and discontinue that i had severe insomnia for the two nights i tried it later in the day my assumption is that means its either d3 or speedon the feels spectrum it feels at least like what i take for 5000iu i dont know that my body can tell the difference between 5000 and 10000 howeverthe pills are interesting not particularly bothersome no nasty burps post pilli would say these feel effective smell fine take easy as ive been on d3 for over a decade and on these for 10 days it looks like and its now gloomy and falllike out id say theyre working ill update if i feel theyre not but it feel about rightman i hate making feels reviews anyone has a d3 testing blood kit around let me knowonly thing of negative note was there was a sticker over the ingredients when i received this not sure if that was the mfg or amazons warehouse but considering it covered ingredients manufacturer etc i peeled it off attached pic with and without stickerunder the sticker is that its formulated in the usa but nothing to indicate that the formula is actually grown combined packaged in the usa the karamd inc address corresponds to a commercial office space in cleveland but there are no clear markings from street viewi checked out karamd on the bbb as i like to know whos producing things im about to ingest seems like a fairly low rating generally involving sales tax issues some supplements that didnt work couple of complaints but resolved bbb will always have low marks as a note nobody thinks lets go there and rate this random company highly all but one show a response which is a good thing appears youll get a response if it doesnt work theyve been around and are responding in at least publicly a positive fashioni should note im pretty sure 10 days ago the description claimed it was 5000iu in the description text 10000 in the header and 10000 on the product i ended up receiving what im reviewing says 10000 for one pill
exactly what i wanted
it has an small buckle that sit in your ear when you sleep in your side

this is like protein isolates on steroids extra healthy extra protein for muscle fuel plus joint support and soft tissueall in a great taste mixtrust you found this review honest and helpful
this mct oil comes in a fancy wine bottle and it is packaged like a fancy wine bottle it has a slight taste of coconut oil versus other mct oils that have no detectable tasteyou are paying a premium for the presentation of this oil not for the quality of the oil the bottle looks fancy and like a premium product if that is the look you are going for maybe you are buying this for a bar or restaurant where the appearance matters for the oil to be the highest quality it would be better if this was 100 c8 oil other brands try to stand out by selling organic mct oili drink mct oil daily in coffee and i have tried many of the brands another brand i have in my kitchen is the inexpensive horbaach mct oil that costs 015  fl oz this genesis mct oil has the same ratio of oils and costs 148  fl oz premium 100 c8 mct oil is cheaper than genesis mct oilmany mct oil bottles suffer from a pouring problem and drips this bottle pours like a wine bottle which is fine and it has the problem with the last oil drip running down the side like many other bottles i keep my bottles on a paper towelthis mct oil is sold in clear glass versus nearly every other mct bottle being sold i am unaware of any issue with mct oil degrading if exposed to light but it is something to take note of many places caution to keep oils out of sunlight the now brand sells their mct oil in dark brown glassthe bottle says high octane on it which is silly marketing they are likely trying to play off the pioneer in the field of mct oils bulletproof brain octane c8 mct oil which is higher quality and less expensive than this oil octane the hydrocarbon has a c8 molecule in it which corresponds to the 100 c8 oil in the clever marketing of that competing product
fit perfectly in my ears and i got the best night sleep as i did not have to listening to my husbands loud snoring have not gotten to use the other ear plugs in the set yet but i am sure they are just as great  thumbs up ear joy
you will need to buy a rubber insert or gaskit because it does not fit any scooter post no matter how much you tighten it its too big i had two different scooter brands and birthed fit it without the rubber gasket i bought at a hardware store so your basket twirls and eventually starts to scoot down on your scooter otherwise i love it i cant carry my cell purse tv clicker anything
very strong massage gadget does not replace a great hands on massage but it does what it says it can do knead muscles
couldnt wait to apply this oil to my face and body  my skin felt so smooth like it use to and the itching stopped to  added a dropper to my bath wash it was heavenly showering  added a dropper to my shampoo and for once my scalp wasnt itchy  added a dropper to my body lotion  finally i feel like i can live in my own skin like i use to  it didnt make the eczema go away but it soothed the itching  this oil is a god send
i dont have any kind of beard it is painful to use when i tried to shave my neck it was pulling my hair out rather than cutting
this is not a lifesaving tourniquet it should not be used in a reallife trauma situation the materials and construction are woefully subpar parts of it started to break immediately it looks like many wellknown tourniquets but it is not onpar with the real thingthat said its inexpensive and mimics the cattype ones close enough for training purposes i used it at a class this past weekend and was pleased that i didnt need to put my real medical gear through adverse use conditions a box of these would be fine for something like a stop the bleed course if budget is a concernagain this is not a lifesaving tourniquet training use only
will buy these again and again
though these gauze packs are nonsterile and a bit thin theyre still a decent deal at this price point for backup use emergencies disasters i wouldnt use them in my main first aid kit for my home or car but for my backup kits and emergency bugout bags im okay with taking the chance on nonsterile gauze
i typically drive 1015 hours a day for work i bought this cushion to help with the pains i was experiencing as a result of my work not only did this cushion do nothing to ease my discomfort but it actually increased my discomfort into painbefore using this cushion i took 5 minute stretch breaks every 34 hours and i worked 1215 hours after using the cushion i had to take a stretch break every hour and i could only sit for 810 hours of work a dayseriously i am super disappointed in this cushion if i could give negative stars i would i contacted the company to let them know that i was displeased with this product but they wouldnt refund me now im stuck with this overpriced lintmagnet gel square thats good for nothing
i have been washing dishes a lot since the dishwasher was not doing its job  but  i believe i got the medium size  and they fit good but not tight  i have small hands  and the medium is not tight  and not loose  i can take them off easily and put them on easierwashing dishes is tough for rubber gloves  knives and forks often make holes  and  these gloves are still going for me  i like them  they last long  and no holes after many uses  i have several pairs of these for the bathroom and kitchen  strong gloves  last long
the grapefruit scent is nothing like the description  just smells like cleaner
the cutting head broke where the hinge joins the base
i seem to have a problem with fatigue  i am older and i can be sitting for an hour and start yawning to the point i nearly fall asleep  i can get up and move around a little which does wake me up for a few minutes but if i sit back down the yawning starts again  ive taken these drops for three days now and have not had the yawningsleepy problems like before  not sure if i use up b vitamins more quickly or what but a couple of squirts of this raspberry flavored liquid and im good for several hours  it is a bit sweet but considering im only taking a little and the flavor disappears fairly quickly im okay with it  if you suffer from fatigue these drops may help you too  they sure are working for me
following the directions it was easy to apply and seal up my new granite vanity top was easy 
i dont really know how to review a probiotic however i will say i was on antibiotics for a bit and it tore my digestional tract up and these help get my body back on a 34normal schedule34

it was the business lol no but really it was very easy to use and comfortable
i really like these wash cloths whenever my aide does not come to give me a shower i use these and they are wonderful they have a nice smell to them and they warm up nicely
skeptical buyer but went for it after watching you tube videos on how incredibly clean this product transforms your mildewmoldydirty vinyl siding and decking to like new condition we were amazed our ups driver delivered an amazon box to us and we showed him how clean this makes the vinyl siding he couldnt believe it either in fact he took a snapshot of this product and repeatedly thanked us for showing him as he doesnt have the time to climb ladders to clean his house we purchased this products pump sprayer too the sprayer reached the highest pitch approx 25 of our garage so we didnt need to climb a ladder to apply it either amazing product will use every year for certain
good product
this product is okay  the steam is nice but i think i was hoping for more straightening power  i must be used to the flat iron  this is not it  however it does do what it says it will do  maybe my issue was user error
hubby suffers with pain in the back and legs  he has just started using this  according to information we looked into it takes weeks and perhaps months for significant relief but he thinks there has already been some relief the directions are easy to follow  we are looking forward to the increased results with continued use
description says 4pairs but only 4pcs 2pairs in package feel cheatedreturned and found 4pairs with the similar price from other seller

i love what evridwear has done here  3 pouf balls each with a different exfoliating level white light blue moderate dark blue heavy  you get to try each pouf  all and choose your favorite  i love the white pouf my husband likes the dark blue  the variety isnt the only awesome detail  these poufs are very well  made theyre incredibly  strong and durable with  tight bonding that ensures the pouf wont quickly stretch out or fall apart  each does a great job washing exfoliating skin all skin types  and produce a nice lather with soap or body wash  i have terribly dry sensitive skin and these poufs do not irritate or scratch my skin in any way  all 3 are comfortable to use  they even have small rope so the pouf can be hung up when not in use the colors are nice as well  i love the plastic zipper bag the poufs come in  it serves as an excellent storage bag to hold the poufs until theyre used i was seriously shocked at the price for as high quality and well made as these poufs are i would have expected them to cost far more  theres a pouf for everyones preference i just love that evridwear thought to do the 3 different levels what a fantastic idea   evridwear even offers a 60 day quality guarantee your skin is going to look and feel great  thanks to these poufs definitely recommended
i like it but too long squeeze pump inflate  i had injury my neck and spine i feel like support sort of some my neck helps inflate
boring no color to know what youre having and flavor is weak wouldnt recommend
these are basically candy with a small amount of elderberry and vitamin c the dosage of elderberry is quite low and they are pretty much straight sugar they also dont look anything like the picture and are coated in sugar they definitely are delicious but if you want something with a higher amount of elderberry and lower amount of sugar id probably get something else
smells so clean not a strong smell  ill buy more of this i love it
mounted into waterpik base perfectly only quibble is a slow drip where hose goes into handle for a short time after use reviews show its a common complaint
great buy i would recommend seller ant timethanks
finally something that does exactly what youd hoped it would 20 min use after 10 years neglect and all the calluses are gone no more useless pedicures with some tiny girl using an emory board just that just smooths my 1234 thick calluses this thing is easy gentle and amazing
i needed a new small travel jewlery keeper and this works well and fits the stuff i bring on vacation i like the compartments and the quilted zipper case good purchase and the price was good too
this is a great way to boost your immunity add a little into your foods for both health benefits and flavor i love the convenience i usually prefer using fresh foods but when something like red reishi mushrooms are hard to find in my area this is the secondbest way to go
this oil has the classic sandalwood fragrance kind of woody with a powder and incense base noteit seems to be one of those things that you really like it or you dontits a wonderful addition to homemade soaps especially for gentlemen
i will pass this on to my friends and family
worked well to keep my jewelry together while traveling

the best beard trimmer i have ever owned  long battery life easy to change and control trimmer depth
the selfie stick is easy to use and easy to hold  i love that it has the bluetooth remote  so much easier than setting the timer for selfies it extends to a good length and the tripod is a great bonus  love everything about it
the goodi absolutely loved this thing until it came apartit was easy to install and adjust to my 2004 colorado taking only about 10 minutes with a wrench ratchet and socket sitting at the car door in my wheelchair it could have been done with two pair of pliers though once adjusted it simply lifts out of place when someone else needs to drive the vehicle and is easily returned to position when i am ready to drive againit was only a short learning curve until i was completely comfortable driving with itit was the only left foot gas pedal accessory that i found that didnt have to be bolted to the floorthe badafter only two months the glue that held the plastic base that has the spikes that hold it secure in place by engaging the vehicles carpet completely let go as shown in the pics i would return it but for two reasons i dont want to be without it and i am afraid that the glue on the new one will give out in two more monthsthis is a potentially dangerous problem and you should be watching for it if you already have one or intend to buy oneconclusioni am not saying that you should not buy one but you should be aware of this fatal flaw and be aware that you may have to reglue it furthermore for 300 there should be some thought at the manufacturers level as to how to fix this serious problem
container  stiff pretty fits in car cup holder no lid so after use you just have a tall cylinder with a hole on toptissue rougher than kleenex softer than hospitalhotel tissue works for wiping nose but rough cold or touch up on makeup no also smaller than kleenex comparison in picture so softer prettier hospital tissue also because its rough and stuffed so tight its really difficult to pull only one out i ended up pulling out a lot and tear all of them very frustratingoverpriced for the quality these shouldnt be more than ten in my opinion
at first i loved it because i could breathe more easily but after a while it didnt feel that comfortable  kind of pressed against my nose not painfully but  i was just aware of some pressure  also when i took off the mask i had to find a place to put the shield it  wouldnt stay inside the mask so there were now 2 things to keep track of  im on the fence about this  it does keep the mask cleaner no lipstick stains and it does allow you to breathe but i felt i had to keep adjusting it to try and make it pleasanter to wear  tried it upside down and right side up but it always seemed to press against my nose   it fit nicely inside most masks  both homemade and  disposable ones  i will be so happy when we dont have to wear masks any more  its hard for me to hear at the best of times and the mask straps get caught on my hearing aids and sometimes pull them out of my ears  but i digress
it says its not waterproof but i use this in the shower all the time and it still works great i have seen my acne significantly decrease since using this brush i love love love it and the price is just the icing on the cake
quitting smoking is probably one of the hardest habits to break any help you can get is great this system kind of combines rewards and therapy the sensor helps you track your levels so you get positive reinforcement when you smoke less theres also access to an interactive community to share the journey with others its okay to get help when you need it it doesnt make you weak it makes you smart good luckthanks so much for taking the time to read this review  i hope the information that ive provided helps make your decision a little easier
does the job accordingly
its antifungal and helps itching  crawling
bit big and bulky for smaller people but is sturdy and cushioned
this is one of the nicer sets having had one in the past that was chipped and cracked when brand new and another that literally fell apart after the second usethe stones are nicely polished and rollslide over skin easily so relaxing although if you are looking for this to remove wrinkles prepare to be disappointed puffiness yes wrinklesnoboxed nicely to make for a thoughtful gift
simply did nothing for me
the sponge heads come off almost right away they are not glued to the plastic well at all  you go through 5 heads when you normally would go through one
excellent toner though i didnt recognize that what i am buying is a toner when i add it to my cart i thought it is a facial wash i dont know i just did not concentrate well but im still satisfied the toner is wonderful it gave my skin that fresh glowing clean feeling and look its perfect to wipe your clean face using it before makeup too i didnt breakout afterward the seller sent me  collagen wash gel as a sample and i was impressed with the result too im gonna buy it for sure deserve the 5 stars thank you
absolutely love theseour whole family are doctor who fans but i got these dalek socks for my daughter for back to schoolshe was so thrilled with them in vibrant blue and orange with one pair in a nice grey shade they will work with a variety of outfitsthey hit just over the heel and the socks are soft and comfy my daughter wore them and loved the fit and feel as well as decoration on themany doctor who fan will love emprovided for my opinion and review

i bought to replace a broken chain very good for the price
found ourselves babysitting a mature cat which had to stay in our tiny bedbath combo  no matter how frequently i scooped the litter it was bound to accumulate odors espsmelly cat what are they feeding you remember pheobes song on the tv show friends the litter box was against the wall right in front of where you sit on the toilet  yikes  we keep this deordorizer plugged in  its all but silent but you can hear it circulating the air  im here to tell you i always know when someone has forgotten to plug it back in when theyve used the socket this occupies  it makes a huge difference to our nose  to us that means that its not only working on germs that hit the nose but also those lurking around which we want nothing to do with  germs from potential moldmildew any escaping septic gases germs from morning sneezes and so on if you have a semitighter area where you want to have the air cleaned and smell better this is worth a try it is assuring to know this technology is working for you
this oil has a mild scent to it its what i think of as a classic baby smell i think its lovelyi dont really use baby oil for my skinother than for insect repellant since i dont care for the oiliness it leaves behind but i like to have it around its handy its a main ingredient for many doughssandsslimes which my childrenand myself like to play with the scent of it is relaxing its also great at removing sticky things like gum and stickers and for removing paint from brushes and hands
this thing is amazing i dont know what i was doing with my life before it came along i use it for my shoulders and my neck mostly but it also wraps around my waist and doubles as periodpain relief when needed
cute bag barely zips up and not that strong so i will use only occasionally good for the price jars as described fast delivery

i have used heel tastic for over 3 years and it keeps my heels and toes from cracking  you have to make sure it is heel tastic that you order  i ordered one that i thought was heel tastic and it was useless
the parts fit together well but the squeegee is too flimsy and too narrow if you put even a bit too much pressure it is almost to the metal  squeegee doesnt work very well  not worth the hassle of returning but wouldnt buy again or recommendalthough you can take it apart to make it shorter a full telescoping of all parts would be more convenient also
if you want to buy the best carlons has been in the fish oil business ages before the fad began
the easiest opener i have ever used  it takes much less hand strength than others of its kind

no product can work perfectly for everyone but this has been great for me i have always carried my tension in my neck and shoulders and then i hurt my neck about three years ago snce then ive woken up with a crick in my neck that wont go away for a week or two about once every 4 to 6 weeks sometimes more often sometimes it even happens if i just move the wrong way  throughout the dayi began to use this device about a week ago and it loosened my neck right up in about two days im trying to get in the habit of using it almost every night for 10 to 15 minutes before i go to sleep and my neck feels freer more relaxed and more mobile than it has felt in a few years
these are inexpensive and a decent value for product you get exactly what you pay for and what you expect

i have the month disposable contacts but i am meticulous about cleaning them  i feel by using this at least once a week along with regular multipurpose solutions in my storage case i can at the very least double the time i wear my lens before disposal  there is no material difference between regular lenses and those that are disposable its just the kind of care you give them
these didnt help me find the pet urine maybe my color blindness is the problem  the kids love them to play with my uv lamp helped me much more
they are life savers for my feet

this is great but i suggest getting on and off a few times and take the average also check where it is in the beginning to make sure it is at 0 it is nice for a cheap scale
it is alright

very heavy and thick thank you bags they have crisp clean folds and a reinforced bottom im confused as to why the handles arent put in for you the handles are almost like a grosgrain ribbon they have plastic at the tip youll need to push the tip thru both holes then cross your fingers that they hold up after something heavy is in bag though it seems like plastic tip is enough for them not to slip thru
bristles are not sturdy enough to brush teeth and the bamboo feels like its going to give me a splinter waste of money
these are the very best love the packaging too but way too overpriced on amazon these are whole foods brand and cost a 3rd in store of what is priced here
i am really enjoying the bottles i recd will probably order more soon
i have been using this for years now if i switch it to something else my teeth becomes sensitive

received my first container on time however im still trying to pick my jaw off the floor after opening it only to find less than a container of powder  i included some images along with a tape measure to show the depth of the plastic containerthe contents is a very fine powder that looks thinner than cacao powder if that helps understand the consistencyit has a sweet yet bitterly aroma to itsince mine is missing the scoop i used a teaspoon full into my evening coffeethe taste is not overwhelming in my coffee as im using unpasteurized honey to sweeten my beveragei have taken capsules of lions mane the past few months  however due to a quicker delivery system the powder is supposed to have im trying thismaybe my container was  at the end of the line getting a fill upi will update my review asa i can feel the effects of the powder verses capsules

i love this kit it comes with a wide variety of file textures it works great on bare nails and on acrylics i had never used glass files before and they worked great  much better than i expected they are also attractive which is never a bad thing grin  i recommend this kit very nicely put together and everything you need for trimming and filing a variety of nail types

love the size it can be crammed to the gills with everything a home medical kit could need its great to have for traveling in it i have pain and fever reducers aspirin acetaminophen naproxen  sodium allergy relief gloves masks scissors band aids wound patches laxative pills gauze rolls cough and cold syrups peroxide antibiotics antibiotic ointment antiitch cream boil ointment petroleum jelly rubbing alcohol cotton balls antibacterial hand soap hand sanitizers i think that covers everything and there is still a little more room for more soft type products so even though when you get it it might look small once you fill it up it makes a super portable and travel ready kit the price is right and it is made very nice recommended
kinesio tape is great for many physical body scenarios  i have tried other brands which are not as effective as the kinesio tex gold brand it is very adhesive and generally lasts at least three days you can shower with it on swim sweat etc it is also easy to take off and little adhesive is left on your skin i learned how to apply the tape for my injury from my physical therapist i recommend talking to them before applying on yourself
the band is fantastic the material is a sort of malleable leatherim not sure if its real or not but it is strong like real leatherthe purchase yields three difference colors brown black light brownall of which come in a small package wrapped around a piece of sturdy cardboardall around super productdisclaimer free for review

my grandkids enjoyed this probiotic i tried one and its has a very sweet fruit punch flavor that seems similar in texture and sweetness to a pixie stick
this did a good job with my hair it worked as it was supposed to it seemed like it was good quality my hair came out looking nice after i used it it also seemed durable it was easy to hold and handle i was pleased and would recommend it
this is very moisturizing and protective with hardly any scent  which is perfect for me will buy again as needed
when i first got this i expected it to be brown like other products from these sourceshow this comesthis comes in a large plastic bottle  there is a seal on top that needs to be removedwhat is this likeinstead of brown like other products made from these sources this is clear  there is no flavor or scent  shaking it up does not seem to change thatflavorno flavorhow to takei take a teaspoon of this once a day in the morning in a small cup of waterdoes it do anythingi seem to see a bit of support in energy sleep and overall  i am taking this in the dead of winter where it has been near zero for almost a month straight  i am usually dragging and very tired and worn during this period  i have been taking this along with a few supplements and i am doing remarkably wellthe bottom linethis supplement seems to be supportive through a very difficult cold and dry winter  i am usually tired but taking this i am notmy ratingfive stars  this seems to be working for me  i am not sure why there is no flavor or color but it is helping somewhat so i will finish the bottle
i bought this directly from the manufacturer i must say for the price it was not at all worth it yes it is a cushion but it is a 60 cushion 34best in the world34  no my cushion moves around on my chair all day long and i usually find myself doing the 34one cheek lean34 my computer chair is already cushioned so i went with this cheaper thinner version if i had paid 100 for this boy would i be disappointed by the end of the day there really is no difference i feel like ive turned or re positioned as many times as i normally would at first i felt like i would need to get used to the new cushion but after 34 weeks or so it is still uncomfortable the company reached out to me for my review i gave the same review i did here but have not heard back return policy is meh funny because i live in utah and they are manufactured here in utah
good saw results in about a week
they can be used vertically or horizontally great for christmas cards

i used this straightner for my 5 year old hair she has been suffering from lice for about a month now i heard heat killed them however she has beautiful wavy hair and i did not want to damage it this product is both gentle and effective the brush combined with the heat gives a smooth look i used this combined with a lice comb and i got rid of alot of them i would not recommend to replace your hair straighter i would use it after straightening to create a soft look
perfect fragrance for my kitchen  quality product that lasts and does not clog my diffuser
with the fastening at the front this wrap is uncomfortable its difficult to line up the velcro so perfectly that you dont get scratchedbut with the wrap at the back its fine works very well for what i wanted its soft and seems to be a nice quality
this doesnt foam up and works well for cleaning carpets  i like that there are no harsh chemicals but more soim glad it cleans  it did a great job on my carpets and i will begin trying it on more things as well
tire broke while installing requested replacement or refund and was told i could only get 11 and would have to return and pay for shipping and handling damaged goods poor customer service and still cant use my wheelchair with no tires

i have taken 2 pills in one day and felt no energy or boost i will continue to take since i purchased them however i hope when it is in my system it will do more than this first day
good protection
lid can half broken then completely disconnected within a week  didnt talk to seller  thought it would be better quality
good product works
my joints are slightly better with this supplement
i did not try these yet but so far i am impressed with the producti actually bought them for my mother in law for christmas she likes her air fresheners so i thought she would like this as a gift plus they will probably save her money and reduce wastethey are prettier than the plastic ones bigger than expected and they also seem durable and heavyi will update after she uses them but i really think she will like these
great pre and post workout mix yes it has aspartane but then again the last thing i want in my diet is more sugar i thought the taste was a little sweet so i did dilute this more than the recommended mixture you will probably need to do the same depending on your taste high in electrolytes and protein this is great for my florida workouts with the heat and humidity and i lose more water sweating than in probably any other area of the country i was previously a gatorade drinker but i honestly prefer this science in sport and will be buying more
these work great  im allergic to many of the dryer sheets and these dont cause me any problems
very nice and comfortable mask
easy to use easy to remove and adhesion  removal of pet hair
these are ok didnt provide a ton of warmth but are comfortable
as a husband who recently picked up the heated sleep eye mask by carefor for my wife i am happy to say that she absolutely loves it this eye mask has been a gamechanger for her nighttime routine as it quickly heats up and stays warm for a long time providing her with the perfect amount of relaxation and comfortone of the things that stands out about this eye mask is its 3d ergonomic design it perfectly contours to her face blocking out all light and allowing her to completely relax the graphene material used in the mask is topquality ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed and that she remains comfortable throughout the nightthe magnet suction wire is also a great feature as it keeps the mask securely in place without any discomfort or slipping my wife also loves how breathable and soft the mask is which helps prevent any irritation or sweating around the eyesoverall the heated sleep eye mask by carefor is a musthave for anyone who struggles with migraines dry eyes or just wants a more relaxing and comfortable sleep its also perfect for nap time or travel making it a versatile and useful addition to any routine highly recommended
ive never used anything like this before so my dissatisfaction may simply be user error ill try it again and update if i get it to work well but they say to only use it twice a week for no more than 5 minutes so it may take weeks to figure out what works i got this when i had a blackhead thats not on my face only to learn that this is only supposed to be used on the face on skin that is not thin so i decided to try it on my nose and around my mouth where it tends to get greasy and clogged though my skin was left red with increased circulation i didnt see any pus in the chamberthere are five suction heads to choose from and the directions detail why you would choose one over the other they also describe how to use the different heads most effectively the heads are easy to snap on and pull off they included several sponges that you put between the section head and the vacuum to catch any pus and these sponges are washable and reusable to clean after use you remove the head and the sponge and clean themi got a washcloth steaming with hot water and held it over my chin to nose like they suggested to help enlarged pores i then dried off the area as they dont want any water suctioned into the machine and immediately started using the machine on the preset vacuum level i thought it was level 3 but it turns out it was only level 2 out of 5 still this seem pretty strong to me you run the vacuum head over the area lift and repeat for 1 to 2 minutes the head also has tiny led red and blue lights that shine at your face while youre doing thisyou longpress the power button to turn the power on and off but shortpress it to change between blackhead vacuum mode cold compress mode and hot compress mode there is also a button to change the vacuum speed the cold compress reaches its coolest temperature 20c68f very quickly and youre supposed to use this on an area that has just been vacuumed to help close the pores i feels pleasantly cool the hot compress is supposed to reach a temperature between 38c and 42c or 1004f to 1076f it got up to 31c then started dropping then it turned off automatically this was not warm enough to do anything but feel pleasantly warm i dont see how it could help open pores when hot steam didnt noticeably work
the best part of this sound machine is that an alexatype voice speaks to you as you set the timer 15 minutes press button 30 minutes 60 minutes etc it has a soft foreign accent that i cant place but its cute most sound machines dont have a human voice saying anything i guess its needed because there are no light buttons to tell you which setting youre choosingexcept for this i felt this device feels cheaply made the casing feels cheap hard brittle plastic and the buttons on the interface are not sensitive to touch you have to press really hard sometimes to get it to change settings the volume control is also confusing  there are actually two volume controls  one to raise the volume one to lower i was pressing one volume control the loud one thinking that i could lower it but i was mistaken  you have to press the low volume buttonon the positive side the night light works well  the colors are neon bright and you can keep a steady color going all night long or cycle through the different colors the timer like i said has a human voice which is kind of cool the weak parts are the button responsiveness and some of the sounds the lullaby function is good and the sound is sharp and clear the nature sounds are relatively good  the best are the chirping bird sounds and thunderstorm but the water sounds ie ocean babbling brook sound muffled and are not particularly sharp the white noise is also kind of indistinct and the fetal heartbeat sound is just plain crude  not so much a heartbeat but like someone else noted its like banging drumssoits a serviceable device but i would not pay too much for this there are so many better ones out there
i ordered this shaver for my husband to try and weve had nothing but problems with it it wasnt charged at all upon receiving it it was completely dead  we put it on the charger for several hours as the manual recommended and it workedwhile charging there is a red light next to where the cable plugs in and the light stays lit all the time  even after the shaver is charged so you never knew if the battery if fully charged and whether or not it will overheatthe shaver manual is not much help and in fact makes this product more confusing the printed manual and writing on the shaver box have conflicting charging instructions the manual says to charge up to 8 hours and advises no longer  the box says 1 hour for 60 minutes of shaving this is kind of confusing because my husband was never able to get 60 minutes of use after charging  he was only able to get 2 shaves each at about 7 minutes before the battery went dead and had to be rechargedso my husband will not be using this shaver since the battery keeps going dead and the rotary blades are weakening from pressing the shaver against his face  this shaver is a nogo
as a true nerd i really enjoy the packaging that looks like a beaker it gives you the instant impression that whats inside is very effective the toner addresses several issues with one easy treatment it calms irritation balances oil production smoothes texture and brightens skin tone it kind of straddles the line between toner and essence because it also moisturizes its ideal for oily and acneprone skin use twice daily for maximum effects i highly recommend itthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
the small roller handle came apart withing 2 seconds and wouldnt stay put  the larger roller handle is very thin and will bend when using it  i was gentle with the rollers but these are no good  returning
poor construction  i have 3 other grabbers different makes and this is the first one i shall call crapnot sturdy  the  fold in center of length  does not hold well  lets it weave  wobble  too much trouble to returngrabbers are required in my life since spinal  fusion from t4 neck  to pelvis
item was opened and looks to have had something stuck in there will not use waste of money
i think this is a very good d3k2 supplement it seems to be very reasonably priced as of this review a bottle of 60 veggie caps costs 1619 giving you a 3 month supply one capsule delivers 125 mcg of d3 and 100 mcg  of vitamin k2 210 mg calcium is also included which is only 16 dv i take at least 5000 iu of d3 each day and usually more since it is such a powerful antiviral and is so good for brain health and in combination with k2 needed calcium is stored in bones and being 63 i dont want to get soft or brittle bones as i age i think this is a very good supplement
you know i didnt expect miracles but this is way better than the big orange things i used to get at walgreens  i wore them to see flaming lips at bill graham in sf on halloween  at first i though they didnt do much but my ears were not ringing after the show so they must have done something  my major complaint theyre hard to hold onto which means theyre easy to drop and lose forever in a crowded show  the canister is nice
no good sharpness
been using a berger lamp since 1989 and love them beautiful scents beautiful containers lampes
bought this for my grandpa for fathers day and he wont stop talking about how much he loves it  we tested it out before delivering it to him just so we were familiar with how it works in case he calls us with questions laterwe were surprised that it came full charged we thought it was pretty cool that the led on the front actually displays how much power is left in our case is clearly said 100the bag it comes in is convenient and nice but i doubt hell need it much since my grandpas dexterity is limited we appreciated how easy it is to plug in to charge  we also appreciate that it comes with another set of bladesill be happy to update how well it holds up after my grandpa abuses this one over next three months
study perfect for any first aid kit

perfect for putting brother tze tapes in
these masks are comfortable to wear the material is soft and slightly stretchy these do not have filter pockets nose bridge wires or adjustable ear straps i like the polka dot prints
oddly stevia is not listed as one of the ingredients the ingredients listed are maltodextrin and silica  thats it the product is sweet however and performs as i expected other on products i have used contained the full list of ingredientsthis must be a labeling error
this is exactly what i was looking for  easy to use right out of the box comfortable to hold
best product for stage ii pressure ulcers and moisture related skin breakdown incontinence related dermatitis wouldnt use as a barrier on intact skin ad or zn based product better if skin intact as a wound certified nurse this is one of my favorite treatmentsbecause it works this particular product is the medline version of lantiseptic
the extended length of this shoe horn alleviated back pain my mother was experiencing  using a shorter handled shoe horn  great length for anyone with back issues or inability to be as flexible as they used to be
this is a super compact little light that i about blinded myself with when i was learning to use the controls lol i absolutely love the size of this it can fit on even the smallest most cluttered of desks as it is just a flat screen with a removablerepositionable kickstand nice long cord easy to understand and control the light temperatures were one of the selling points for me as i despise white light and this does not disappoint its warm light is perfect and has different brightness levels the timer is also quite nice i will be ordering at least 1 more for my adult son well worth the price having this in front of me id pay much more
i have an old paint gun and these are getting hard to find

fit my z2 travel cpap perfectly  admittedly i was using it in a more tropical climate so i cant attest to how well it works in a drier area but it seemed to help with dryness that ive experienced without it
wet charcoal goes everywhere so beware and it takes a lot to get it out of your teeth and gums even after brushing with toothpaste i had to floss twice have only used once so no results yet but so far im not impressed

reliable over the years long lasting wash cloth of choice 4 stars
helps with inflammation
the denture bath is nice but its too small
presently the best on the market but get the pro formula as it does the job as i have tried them all
product is exactly as described
these are a perfect fit for the scotchbrite dish scrubber and they work much better than the name brand refills the quality of the materials seems better the green scrubbing sponge seems thicker and more durable and they dont appear to sit and leak soap everywhere like the scotchbrite heads do i will buy again
fantastic sponge durable and great feel to it the band help keeps your hand in place
its really small and hard to apply i have calluses from crossfit plus my hands rip now and then this is no different than rubbing coconut oil on your hands
great buy
i liked that theyre transparent so i can see just how much water is in them they dont leak and retain heat pretty well would buy again but they seem well made and i dont expect to have to
so i have these flats that are just a little too big my heels always come out everytime i take a step i put the black pads on first and my heel came out as soon as i took my first step but then didnt the rest of the time i walked they still felt a little loose so i doubled up and this time i put the nude one on over the black incase youd see a gap and i tell you what they fit perfectly now i gave 4 stars because i feel if they were a little thicker theyd be perfect its a great deal and im so happy i came across these i definitely recommend them
this product works pretty good for upper shoulder muscle issues and it has a nice menthol smell that reminds me of vicks  this is a cream that absorbs well into the skin but i do have to use quite a bit so do not expect it to last very long  having said this it is priced more reasonably than some of the other pain creams out there and in addition to the topical analgesic also has ingredients such as aloe arnica boswelia bromelain and msm  all of these other ingredients have antiinflammatory properties so overall this product has a good combination of ingredients to combat muscle pain
cute lightweight fits well
i bought these for a baby shower gift  they are excellent quality and look exactly like the picture
wonderfully odoriferous good value timely shipping
i love this product totally recommend to anyone will purchase again
ive tried different electric toothbrushes over the years it is particularly nice to have one that is so easily portable  this works almost as well as my sonicare brush but the added convenience that comes with its size and being able to take it with me is much appreciatedthe toothbrush pulses at 30 second intervals and shuts off in 2 minutes  the toothbrush has 5 different modes and 3 strength options so the brush adjusts to the strength and power that you need

i suffer from consistently low levels of vitamin b12 due to a pancreatic issue that i have  i already get monthly shots but my levels remain low so i decided to get this liquid version for a quick pick me up outside of my daily vitamins  i will admit that i noticed a bit of a pick me up from these when added to my diet  the raspberry flavor is pretty strong but i always follow it with a drink of something else that has a strong flavor and its fine  im very happy with this supplement though and will be picking these up again when i run out
works great
almost the same well buy more
this toothpaste worked great leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean and not too dry i tend to have dry mouth as for the ingredients they are vegan friendly and the materials used in the container are ocean safe and recyclable bonus made in the usa good toothpaste
seems to work great have only had it a month now so i will see how it endures
these taste horrible  they have an oragano flavor that is just gross in a gummy  they are cubed shaped as well so swallowing them whole is a chore  im sure they work well enough but i just could not get past the flavor  maybe i got a bad batch or something but too gross for my tastes
as advertised
first i purchased these directly from the manufacturer  thus it doesnt say 34verified34 purchase for me  i went to the manufacturer because i wanted to try a smaller set 1 month set which was not offered on amazon when i purchased it1  a 34one month supply34 is really only a one week supply  the 34effects34 are supposed to last one month  misleading to say the least  should say its a one week supply2  i took pictures that show no difference to my eye  note  i used exactly as described on instructions  also my front top 4 teeth are 15 year old porcelain overlays  supposedly this system is safe and effective on dental work as well as natural teeth  i didnt see it3  it is messy and a two step process tube  1 is the a super stain treater and then tube 2 which you apply after using tube 1  the pic i have included was after tube 2  note  the tubes themselves were a serious pain most of the time they were extremely difficult to get open even with 34careful bending34 per instruction  i think i had one tube that actually opened without considerable force which causes the swab to be displaced making it more difficult to apply the treatment  they also include a tube that you are to use while you are out and about and have eaten or had something to drink that could be potentially staining  it has a soft brush like tip4 initially the solution didnt really effect me one way or the other however by the end of the 7 days my gums were very sensitive  i have a sonic toothbrush with an all purpose name brand toothpaste and brushed my teeth prior to each treatment which i chose to do in the mornings5  it is obviously a peroxide formula of some sort  you can taste it  with a bit of mint or something mixed in but there is no hiding the peroxide flavor6 in the end photos dont lie  i dont see any improvement at all  photo number 1 is before feb 17 photo number 2 is feb 23  the rest were photos i would like to see if i were considering a purchase  hope it helpsin my opinion these are a waste of time and money i included the photos so you could make your own decision  i never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful but honestly i will not be buying these again either from the manufacturer or from amazon
while i didnt get much from it the wife loves this product
this leather cleaner works very well both for shoes and for leather bags  i tried it on a small spot before using it on the full bag it was easy to apply as i can control the amount of cleaner it just requires even application and careful rubbing and it moistens and revitalizes leather
magnesium is an essential supplement for women  it makes a noticeable difference in my everyday life in many areas from lessening anxiety to keeping me regular  im happy with this purchase because its a good deal for a quality product  thank you
id have to say its the first time ive reviewed a product works as advertised but still only gets 1 star the manufacturer doesnt try to hide the fact that it will keep your bong cleaner but not clean honesty is refreshinghowever i have a triple honeycomb disk ice bong and rezblock seems to create a film of its own above the uppermost disk where it only receives liquid during a hit when not being hit for a while that section sits and dries leaving a pink tinge to the resin buildup in that area being that its an ice bong i cant access that area from above to clean it separately to be honest its pricey considering i still have to break out the rezcaps pickling salt and isopropyl every three days anywayno one shows off a new state of the art bong thats nearly clean
i love sweetsation therapy products and this one is no exception usually i order directly from their site but this go it was cheaper on amazon go figure i purchased this after trying the honest brand sunscreen which i bought from costco that was 34honestly34 the worst sunscreen i have ever purchased it was so greasy and oily and never absorbed in their skin they were walking oil slicks for the day and even with it slathered on they still got sunburned not good needless to say i returned that product and do not recommend it at all horrible so in my quest to find a new sunscreen i decided to bite the price bullet and purchase this sunscreen from sweetsation therapy i am sooo happy i did it is a wonderful sunscreen not greasy or oily at all more like a cream that goes on and absorbs wonderfully it also is great at protecting them from the sun especially now that summer has arrived no burns yet very happy with this purchase i will be buying again oh and it doesnt cause any allergy issues with either children especially my daughter who has very sensitiveallergyhive prone skin issues and it smells like chocolate how can you beat that a little bit goes a long way so the heftier price tag is worth the money in my opinion
great little roller balls and i love the color
sorry but not the best cleaner leaves mat with a film that i cant get rid of without running a hose on my mat or putting it in the shower does not work as advertised seems to be a little t of false advertising these days on amazon
i love how they feel and help my persistent dry and splitting heels however im reacting with a rash to the silicone against my skin so ive turned the socks inside out to wear them and put my regular sock over the top so i can slip into my shoes easier and keep my feet warm in these winter months
i like the taste of this one i like the clove and mint taste and it really cleans your teeth well
this was an unexpected little surprise  i will admit upfront i purchased this free to review iti do not end up purchasing everything i am offered i do not believe in purchasing things or taking things i will not use  this however was intriguing to me  i have long hair that is past my waist and i already use hair straighteners and curling wands  i am 43 and with long hair one must be careful to not fall into the category of having old lady hair that should not be long  i love my hair and love good hair styling products and hair products in generalthe brush registers in celsius but the instructions tell you what settings to use so getting past the learning curve it is easy  the thing can get hot  and i would not just set it on the counter  the back of it gets very hot even when it is cooling downa con is where the buttons are located  when i am using it i keep turning it either off or hotter or cooler  the buttons are in a very very bad spoti have used this on slightly damp hair and dry hair and i say it works best on slightly damp hair  small sections also work the besti have not had any problems with melting plastic or anything  no weird smells  no hair burningdoes it make my hair straighter  actually  yes  and softer too  that was the pleasantly surprised part  do i like this better than my name brand hair straightener  i dont know  i think i like them both differently  i think this straightener is faster  i think my name brand straightener makes for smoother hair  i guess i am also afraid of damaging my hair and since this is made out of country i do not know much about the ceramics used and so i am very conservative and cautious when i use thisi have attached a picture of before and after use  this was damp just showered hairoverall a good purchase  i plan on using it often
no relief from pain this local medication

this is an absolute perfect gift to give my 19 year old grand daughter she just loves everything that is bling and sparkly this si a great size of 7 inches long and will fit perfectly in her purse there will be no more waiting on her to do her hair because now she can do it in the car on the way since it has a car plug in it is great that this is dual voltage as it will allow her to travel in the military it is very light weight and comes with its own carrying bag it heats up fast and works great on my trial run with it before i give it to her
i was very surprised how amazing of a job this product does  i have tried it on the dirtiest of pipes and some very hard to clean pieces and had great success with any attempt instructions were easy to follow and even a friends pipe that hadnt been cleaned since he got many moons ago was able to come clean with the recommended time didnt even have to sit for hours like recommended for dirty pipes ive also found no residual flavor after a simple wash out this product is very well worth the purchase and now im a lifelong customer
i bought for work to check pull forces on material handling equipment  works just as well as the professional ones that cost 1000  you cant calibrate it but it gets close enough for what i need it for  excellent purchase
love this stuff
i got this for my daughter whos almost four years old we cant find any bigger swim diapers anywhere for her and im so glad i found this shes not potty trained due to disability and im glad theres something out there for someone like her so shes able to keep swimming practice since the pool doesnt allow those disposable ones anymore id imagine that there would be many out there who could use these big swim diapers too i like the basic colors we can pretty much use this on her with any cute swimsuits over it cant even tell that this is underneath her swimsuit thank you pool pal
very nice and workable bottles for making oil blends i love the cobalt blue also
the tool itself is great but its almost useless bc it wont stay on the floor the suction cups come off easily its a shame bc it could be brilliant
i had a good buying experience items are what they say only 3  because they unfortunately do not work for my hubs maybe its just him  not the products  theres a chance it may work for some  not others for the price it certainly doesnt hurt to try
the cloth liner didnt even make it through one house cleaning
these are so easy to open and close and stay closed too  they are so cute and convenient for carrying pills in my purse  i couldnt ask for a better product  price is great too
this lotion is a must have in my house i have insane foot and calve cramps that wake me up out of deep sleep i rub some of this on and within a minute they calm down and i can fall back to sleep sometimes i just out it in my feet before bed because it relaxes me and helps me get a good nights sleep there is no smell its not overly greasy or sticky i love this stuff and have recommended it to multiple people who now also swear by it its something i dont mind spending money on because its a necessity
this set of toothbrushes is terrific especially for those with sensitive gums and teeth the brushes are soft and almost sponge like they are effective at cleaning teeth without causing irritation they are comfortable to hold and use the cylindrical plastic cases make them ideal for travel one of the caps is perforated to let moisture out the four different colors help family members easily identify theirs very impressed
love the fit and style
one broke after about two weeks i will see how the next one lasts
followed directions and takes some time so hoping it worked not easy to know if it works for money but will try not sure i would buy another unless i feel it does help to seal my granite from smelling
i like the toothpaste no fluoride it cleans and whitens however it has sodium benzoate
this product is great especially for the price  its easy to use and my baby girl doesnt mind it at all
i cooked two of the eight burger patties i got off amazon magic truck yesterday  little shrinkage and great taste  happy
cute militarydressed dog matches gave away with candles during the holidays  i like them price was too high though i purchased on a whim  none of those who received them as gifts mentioned how adorable they were guess ill have to choose my friends better in the future
what an endearing book its as pleasant as drinking tea in the garden and kitchen with a good friend this book is helpful practical and fun i would recommend it to anyone even though i have quite a few herb books this was was a good addition it has a clean feeling to it simple and nice
this toilet spray does do a good job of killing odors and is quick and easy to use the scent however is just ok granted pretty much any scent is better than the scent this is meant to cover up but the sea salt scent is more floral than i was expecting its an ok scent but not 100 to my liking the other issue ive had is that the sprayer doesnt always spray properly instead of a mist it sort of splatters the liquid at times making a bit of a mess unless your aim is perfectly true its only happening with one of the containers so it seems that the sprayer is defective given the price point better quality sprayers should have been usedthe scent plus the sprayer issue lowers my score to 4 stars but its otherwise a decent product that does what it says it will do
i buy these because i like that i could just dispose and they are not plastic or styrofoam but they are expensive
these keto electrolyte drops have helped me to get back on the track to losing weight they dont taste the best in the world but they dont taste horrible either they are better taken in something to drink the bottle is good sized for the price you pay the keto salt isnt strong tasting which to me is a good thing because i cant hardly stomach that taste these work good and are a great value
works and you do not get sick on thisonly it is a little too much moneybut if you need it  go for it
i was so happy to see something pretty for an 80 year old birthday party  these were reasonably priced very soft and quick shipping  definitely use them again
i have slouched my whole life and have always had bad posture after having this product for only a week i am standing up straighter and people are commenting that i look better and healthierjust from standing up straight it comes with instructions that are easy to follow and i only keep it on for about 30 min to an hour a day while i do household chores such a game changer
the fit works very snug not as much force its a slight notice of power as the brand name replacement heads but just as good for the price
it works fine
tastes great i used it in smoothies frozen fruit milk and ice and it mixes really well not sure it would mix well if you are just trying to use a liquid definitely better to blend it in a blender ive had this container for months and still have half of it left and its just as fresh as ever the price is a little high but it does seem to last a while
couldnt sit in at office chair all day without it so comfortable i could sit on it 247
oh my gosh this is so comfortable  my back is so happythank you
almost makes tie shoes into slipons

good for getting accurate circumference measures on yourself and others the plastic portion on the end of the tape keeps the tape from retracting into the container and being lost forever this portion of the tape needs to be reinforced as the tape is useless once it breaks
this are huge i tie a know on one corner and they dont fall out when the trash is taken you can reuse them until they get really dirty and smelly
ive used this for years now it gives me the feeling that my back feels better not sure how it works but i use it on my back
excellent product for neck pain
high quality capsules 
these little bags are the perfect size for portion control they work great
for the past couple of years ive hardly been sick at all i take my vitamin c daily and i think that helps but recently i was around someone who was coughing and touching everything and spreading their cold everywhere it was very frustrating to realize that i was probably going to get sickwell i had one day of feeling like i was getting a cold and i took this four times a day as prescribed wow im not sick this stuff really must work i found the taste inconsequential in a glass of water i could not taste it at all one dropper full in water is the recommended dose it is about 25 drops of liquid i counted it to be surebuying this may seem expensive but how much is your health worth to me it was well worth the cost and this bottle will last a long time as you use so little when they say you will be well in a day they really mean iti was very impressed with this remedy and will keep it on hand at all times it works better than anything ive tried before i even told my nurse practitioner about it and she thought it was goodwho wants to be sick for a week or more i just dont have the time as with all herbal remedies do consult with your doctor before takingthe rebecca review
these are classic ziploc gallon size bags with a nice slider closing they are durable  hold a lot a great find on amazon for a loved ones favorite nfl team fabulous price to pay for an unexpected special gift to receive in the mail i definitely recommend
expensive but excellent product  if you can afford it buy it
i bought this hoping to increase my fiber intake to help regulate me  it turns out its only soluble fiber which didnt do anything for my purposes  the product itself is easy to take  it dissolves fully after a minute or two and is completely taste and texture less  its easy to take but it wasnt any use to me
it really does pull the gunk out of your pores
these are very convenient the box looks nice enough that i can put them on a side table
these do what they say they do they are very easy to swallow i have had no problems with them
i personally do not like this product it contains caffeine i took two pills and i could not sleep for an entire nightthe concentration of vitamin b12 is too high it doesnt make any sense to take all that vitamin b12 every day your body will discard the rest with urine and you will have a peak of vitamin b12 in the blood despite b12 does not induce cytotoxicity why wasting money in something you dont needadditionally they put in optimind lgaba to compensate the effect of caffeine so why putting caffeine in the first placethis is an extremely expensive itemplease be careful because they are very sneaky if you cancel the free trial subscription period on line on their website in fact you click cancer and you see a message you are almost done however you have to wait a few secondsminutes to display the final please cancer now only then you will receive an email confirming your cancellation this is a very sneaky way to induce people to forget to wait and continue with cancellation and charge them with an additional chargealpha brain is for example a superior product more cost efficient and with no caffeine if people want caffeine they can drink a coffee
these aminos taste so damn good ive bought these twice now and i dont know if im placeboing myself to death but i could swear that im recovering much faster since i started taking them ive always had a few workouts that have left me sore and spent for the next 2 or so days and that has stopped just had to take almost 3 weeks off from the gym and i came back with no soreness inspite of an intense workoutthe only issue i have is with the packaging the bag is way too big and the scoop way too short for the amount you get you have to stick your hand completely in the bag to get anything out my knuckles always come out covered a shorter bag or a small plastic container is really needed bag also reads about 40 servings i got closer to 30 by using the included scoopedit i asked rem one of the company owners about the packaging and he said theyre going to make the switch to smaller tub containers so no more dusty knuckles he responded almost immediately a customer service
love this stuff it has alot of health benifits and i dont have and issue with the taste of vinegar but my daughter also uses it  and she likes the taste too it took her about a week and now she even puts it in her water and like the taste the best part is it is natural
great replacement for my favorite running shoes
these are pretty sturdy can be washed and reused easily  they dry quickly they are too thin to be washed in a washing machine i plan on using about a sheet a week to clean my kitchen counters these are way better than using a towel or sanitizing wipes as these are biodegradable and better for the earthi ordered these in two colors magenta and fuchsia they are basically the same color and the color dosent bleed off the fabric
these cup are just odd the gold rim looks cheap and it they break easily i dont like them and i wouldnt use them anywhere
i have a pair of duck boots and i have a few pairs of tennis shoes that have developed a smell that is somewhat gross  i sprayed them with10seconds disinfectantdeodorizer and the smell has either been reduced to a minimum or removed  i have applied this product at different intervals depending on how often i wear the pair of shoes  it does a good job
perfect just as described
i wanted a nice looking set of clippers but also needed them to be functional i also wanted both a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper in one set the clippers arrived quickly and when i got the set home i wanted to try them out right away they came together in a set in a small cardboard box there isnt a carrying case but i will just slip them into a small makeup bag for storagethese clippers felt solid and balanced in my hand but were easy to cut with the clippers are easy to grip because they are ergonomically correct and they cut smoothly every time they cut through the nail very cleanly with no jagged edges or pulling too these clippers open wide enough to cut well for im sure even thick nailsand are curved on the ends for an even cut i had absolutely no problems in using these clippers the clippers are made of strong stainless steel that allows me to sanitize them without worry of rust or corrosion they should last a lifetime i received the product for testing purposes i have no complaints or problems and the product ive tried is working very well for me this is my personal opinion and i am in no way required to write a review i will leave honest feedback that i base on my own personal experience with the product i receive i am in no way affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods
yeah i know  strange thing to purchase and talk about  heres the scoop  we are owner operators and so we own our own trucking company  every once in a blue moon i go with hubs in his truck  i also have a baby bladder  i inevitable have to urinate when i should be sleeping at night  who wants to get out of the truck and go into a truck stop or otherwise in the middle of the night  dont want to have to wake hubs to take me  also  the current health situation in our country  who wants to use public restroomsthis one is cumbersome it ends up leaking too much tubing the gasket thingie falls off i dont loke this at all
easy to make and great tasting
not sure after using it only one time so far
it does not work for gymnastics activities  34it stays34 seems to work better
the texture is just right not too much hard beeswax or too much soft olive oilthe price is reasonable compared with the big name brandthe taste of olive oil is ok  id rather have that than petrochemicals on my lipsim not happy that the useby date is only 2 months after the date my order cameso all the unused tubes will have to be stored in the refrigerator or freezer door until needed
not enough iron to keep up with anemia even taking double during the one week a month
these are pretty good for general noise cancelling  mowing the lawn sporting events etc but i wouldnt recommend them for shooting none of them felt like they protected my hearing as well as my over the ear protectors do
i used this only once since it arrived yesterday but i was really pleased  it is very lightweight which surprised me and when i was finished brushing my teeth my teeth were actually so clean they were shiny  it is much more comfortable for me than my former electronic toothbrush since it is smaller and reached all of my back teeth  and just for fun i loved that i bought the pink one
a nice fiber pickmeup for no guilt snacks andor light meal replacement they taste healthy not real sweet but pleasant
i dont mind taking these they taste good and easy to get your fiber
fast and accurate
the order came on time undamaged and i am pleased i ordered this producti never thought being to acidic would cause many health issuesnow i can keep myself in check dailyor whenever i wanti plan to order from this company for giving this product as xmas gifts to people in my circle
ok so i never know if the natural stuff works as i have no patience and end up taking tylenol as well to suppress symptomsanyway this past week i caught a pretty bad cold sneezing runny nose etc i took this for 23 days  sudafed pe to suppress symptoms and in 2 days i felt human again my colds usually last minimum a week to 10 daysi also took olive leaf for my throat and i think that took care of thatno natural remedy ever worked on me  i think this is a winner so far  pricey yes but have been uing it already for months i think it stopped a cold at the very beginning a few times and still have some left
didnt do anything for me
these are amazing i use them to drive through the canyons and they are extremely helpful they also help you to stay calm and not get anxiety because you cant see the oncoming cars with their bright lights i recommend these to anybody especially truck drivers or anybody who has to work during the night
perfect just what i needed to cut my husbands hair and mine
these cleaning sheets dont come with instructions re how much water to use i used half a sheet and a bucket and gradually added as i needed  the sheet dissolved easily and the detergent worked well  i like that it is so easy to store and such a space saver thus ecofriendly  i wasnt sure if it would work as well as regular cleanser but it was effective and did not give off the toxic fumesscent
ive never used a water flosser before but wanted to try one so glad i did this flosser has a good size reservoir for one cleaning has all the attachments you need for various purposes works great and happy with this particular product its also easy to charge and can be transportable
these wipes work great for cleaning lenses they are easy to use and i like that you can simply throw them away i would buy them again
their orange cream flavor tastes so much better
good product thank you
this is a bit stronger because it does have alcoholwhich is what i prefer as it works best for me
product packaging was poor with no protection for a thin box product itself seems to be undamaged quality of product is fine
i forgot i had it but mut say fewer lasting odors now plugged in all the time
i was very pleased on how much this belt helped with back pain and belly pressure especially for the low cost
never have seen such small pill boxes
i was very pleased with these rinsefree bath cloths by nurture they are larger than i expected thick and soft with just a little bit of water and a couple squeezes they produce a nice lather that for me was enough to wipe my entire body the lather isnt so thick that you feel you need to rinse and it dries comfortably without feeling sticky or stiff these are handy for camping for travel for those who are ill or recovering from surgery or for a gym bag very versatile very easy to use
this is a good idea in theory but poorly executedtheres not much in the way of pros and many conspros   1 washable and reusable   1 as others have mentioned this opens up the sides of the mask so so much that it effectively means that youre getting unfiltered air coming in   2 these dont fit an adult face unless you have a small chin to get the mask to cover the nose the bottom edge of the mask will press into your skin above your chin and below your bottom lip its not a super sharp plastic edge but its enough to make a mark when you wear it for a while   3 theres nothing to attach this to the mask so when you remove the mask this will fall off onto the floor or the ground unless you remember to catch it as it falls   4 it doesnt work with regards to preventing your exhalation from fogging up your glasses  it does reduce it a tiny bit but not nearly enough to be usefuli really wish this worked as described although it might work for children hardpass on this particular mask insert well see how some of the others work
this is ok but not great  it says not to use your finger but it doesnt have an applicator so i guess youre supposed to use a tissue  it burned a little when i first put it on  later when i had to wipe it felt a bit numb so i guess the numbing property does work  i dont really like it as much as some of the name brand ones i have
great purchase
not long enough
needs to be more evident what the scent is imo
so far so good they are placed in the lawn and hopefully protecting from gophers
trinova grill cleaner spray for bbq  works great just spray and let it still a little while then you have to scrub at it a little bit makes it a lot easier then just trying to use water with the scrubbing tool
weve already happily gone through two sets of these great simple teether we tend to keep one in every baby bag to have on hand
very messy to use leakingplease take it back
doesnt dissolve  i followed the directions from the online description  package did not come with instructions  could not see my using it to gift
hard to lose or misplacethey are hanging around your neck when not in use  the masks are designed to adjust to your face  no more ears flapping in the wind  wonderful idea  i wont purchase an imported mask to protect me from a virus that was imported  i ordered a black and a white mask on a saturday and received them on monday morning
i like the idea of a finger brush to brush my dogs teeth but i think the bristles are too soft to clean anything
the cider vinegar does seem to improve digestion not that i have a particular problem the cider vinegar gets me through the day without noticing digestive nuancethey taste good at the end of my supplement taking session i like them try them for a week and you might notice a benefit
you now theres no getting around it a half hours worth of basic research on the internet will prove that em fields have minimal if any effect on humans health however if the conspiratorial side of you is dead set on protecting itself from the evils that are wifi signals microwave emissions etc then this is the product for youall judgement aside i have to say that shortly after applying the product to the underbelly of my laptop i began noticing extreme lagging on my pc im talking snails heredoes the product work well it shot my pc to heck so im assuming yes and if thats what youre going for than five staras for me im peeling it off nowi hate to be totally negative so here are a few positive aspects of the product lightweight peals easily doesnt smell of glue whatsoever easy to cut and mold to your preferred shape actuallylikely does what it says it does can be a neg or possplease see my youtube video review for a demo and moredisclaimer free for review
love this product  tastes great no chemical after taste  been sick once in three years feel great with lots of energy
i love this brand these came at the perfect time because everyone around me has a cold these are a lot more gentler on my nose than the weird off brand my company orders  these dont dry my nose out as bad at the othersi like that these are thick and dont fall apart and the boxes have an appealing design
very nice worth the money
the sponges are what you would expect to buy at a dollar store the steel wool should hold up for many months  the sponges i expect will last a month
i have eyelash extensions and this mask fits perfectly without damaging the extension will buy again in a heartbeat
i bought one of these for each of my cars and have been very happy with it its the perfect size to hold a lot of stuff but not take up too much space in the trunk i fit every kind of first aid item i might need into it and still have some room to spare bandages glove flashlight little reflective trauma blankets pain killers and a ton of other stuff has a good system of pockets and dividers to organize things as well i put different categories of things in ziplocks for the larger pockets and put some things by themselves in the side pockets
i have been using these for dishwashing and they are little big for me  but they are workable  i have used the other pair for bathroom cleaning and same thing  they hold well enough  they have long sleeves and seem to be really good quality  great cleaning and dishwashing gloves
good fit  decent backing  not as plush as some but nonetheless a very good liner at a good price
these are on point
this has an awesome taste but what i didnt love was the fact  that although they said on their website it is third party certified i didnt see the seal on the product itself
my mum looks beautiful in blue  everyone is happy with the stand out color and solid construction  thank you for making this cherished urn to hold our mum
this sound machine comes with a total of 28 sounds 18 are under the white noise button and 12 are under the lullaby button this is a plugin unit and comes with a usb cable but no ac adapter the unit itself and a regular instruction pamphletoperation is simple as per my video all the controls are on the top front of the unit i have to hold press the onoff button to turn it on and do the same to turn it offthere are seven operational buttons on the top the timer can be set for 30 60 or 90 minutes or turned off for continuous play the unit can be used as a nightlight only or with the soundmost of the sounds are crisp but a couple are a bit staticky and that is the reason i rated this 4 instead of 5 starsthe current price of 2339 2599 minus 10 is competitively priced
worked great for a web
the two buttons are not enough i needed 3 buttons on each flap side in order to secure it for both my toddler and newborn
it works as described but i bought it without reading the ingredients and it contains egg yolk which i am allergic to it 
i waited 6 months to post my review because i wanted to use this iron long enough i am a seamster  i use my iron every day i have had many irons in my 75 years of life listen to me and do not buy this iron it does not steam but it pours the water in one part of your fabric while other parts are dry this iron has not been made for even nice steam something is wrong i use only distilled water dont pay even 10 dollars for this iron
easy way to get your fiber and no mixing
smells fresh and clean makescleaning the shower easy
love these they work just great my only peeve is that they squeak but i remedied that by coating the squeaky parts with graphite as a dry lubricant so that it didnt collect dust and hair i have advanced peripheral neuropathy a nerve condition so walking is a pain the cane i used just doesnt cut it anymore i needed support on both sides so i puchased these and can move around swiftly instead of slow
im stocking up on all immune boosters from here on out elderberry gummies are at the top of my list and these gummies have echinacea as well to boost immunity love the gummies since they taste good and are super easy to chew for the kids as well i am convinced after using them through cold and flu season that they really do help
purchased this so that my girlfriend and i could better track our weightprogress as we both work towards getting into better shape the scale appears to be well constructed works as intended and looks great to boot
flavor not as bad as described
these are now something you may need if wearing a mask for  many hours a day several days a week  the silicone doesnt pull on your hair so its comfortable it can be a bit small depending on the size of your head my husband has a big head and it can be tight depending on the mask straps  they worked fine for me and they have saved my ears from chafing  the ear loops hook easily over the button thingy on the extender  th extender has a small amount  of stretch so you can adjust your mask for the comfort level you prefer
like magic these things scrap away dirt like nothing else i finally found a product that does not scratch but gets dirt off my only problem is they really are one shot only and deteriorate very quickly they cannot take much abuse but they do what no other sponge can
these brake after flossing one or 2 teeth i had to throw them away
good suction not super long with the thickness not so much for beginners good buy though
these drink packets are perfect for rehydrating after a long bike ride they are very compact and light which is nice for being out and about the drink has nice flavor and isnt overly fruity or sugary
great product thanks
arrive as promised  was as described  nicely packaged 
this is an excellent blood pressure monitor there are only a few minor quibbles that doesnt take away from how good the unit performspluses very well made attractive shape and appearance large easy to read display well written  informative user guide voice prompts provide start status and read out of results 2 user memory function cuff has instructions that provide guidance on proper fit micro usb power option results were accurate in line with results received during annual physical examminuses 3 aaa batteries not included usb cable  charger are also not includedin a lot of cases with devices that take batteries you normally get really cheap noname batteries i dont mind that theyre not included as id rather spend the money on good quality alkalines or rechargeables but i can see where not having batteries to get you started would be a bummer likewise im not really disappointed that a charger isnt included especially at this price pointthose little inconveniences aside the unit works incredibly well its easy to know the direction when placing the cuff on the user guide is well written it was easy to follow the step by step instructions even though i could see the results on the large lcd screen it was to have the voice prompts let me know my results i see this as a great benefit to elderly people who may have a little trouble reading the screen and you can save your results to memory for 2 separate users to recall at a later date nice
ive been trying new dental products lately looking for something more natural that works i wont be ordering this again though it is not offensive in any way i just dont care for it it doesnt have much flavor or leave my breath fresh its crumbly and the bits can easily slip out of your mouth while brushing i do use an electronic toothbrush though so maybe with manual it might work better its just not for me
slim and well made  it fits perfectly at the end of my 1234 deep cupboard over the sink  the installation was easy because of the numerous slots available for drilling and anchoring the georgia pacific 21000 two ply style towels fit just right and pull out singularly without waste  this is the second commercialstyle towel dispenser that i have purchased for my kitchen in the last four years  the first one was a slim roll design that dispensed single ply towels  the double  ply towels dispensed with this unit are stronger and more absorbent requiring fewer towels for average cleanup in the kitchen  this was actually a costsaving investment
i like to use these to add to my laundry for an extra boost of cleanliness my bf gets sweaty and oily and that transfers to clothes and sheets i mix the borax and washing soda together and sprinkle a scoop into every load to keep the soil at bay they help my wash smell fresh and stay clean
i was hesitant to get this based on some of the negative reviews here  but the positive ones convinced me to try it  and the price was good enough that i thought 34why not34first of all i have fibromyalgia and have severe pains and have been desperate  im not someone who is comfortable to get a massage and even if i was i would be poor if i went as often as i would need to  so what to dook  i got it today and tried it about a half an hour ago  i think that alone tells you what i think of this spa mat  that i literally came on here to review it right away  i didnt even bother with 34low34 and went right to 34medium34 high seemed to scare me for the initial setting  i figured itd be similar to a tsunami  the power of the bubbles was amazing  gets you all over and was so powerful that the tub looked like a pot of crazy hot boiling water  and that was on mediumoh and yeah  while a 1015 minute bath is usually cool at the end this amazin beauty keep the water at a nice temp  regarding the mat floating  it does  some of the suction cups stuck great and others did not  frankly who cares  this is supposed to make the water bubble and it does that job fantastically  made me feel good and relaxed   woolastly  other people complained about the noise  the noise of the unit is quiet  the massive bubbling is noisy    and seriously if youre complaining about bubbling noise then why did you get a 34body bubbles bath spa34 mat  lol  personally i liked it and it reminded me of being on vacation and in a big hot tuband for storage i figured that since ill likely be using it 23 times a week the best way to store the mat is just to stick it on the side of the shower wall   perfect so the excess water can drain out and it can dry well
very nice  looks just as pictured  i put a yarn project keeper some yarn and a couple other small items without trouble  the measurements given were active  the ribbon is lovely thick satin ribbon and is white  plenty of it with lots of tail after closing the top  the material of the bag is thin but effective  i cant see through it  i would buy again  its a lovely reusable gift bag it arrived quickly i have prime and in great shape along with other items i ordered
a word of caution im sensitive to stimulants so the first 3 days this messed with my stomach a bit after that im good to go at 178lbs the recommended dosage is 22 scoops for me because im sensitive to stimulants that is just too much everytime i do two scoops i end up bonking mid workout shaky hands starving have to stop and eat and rest a good half hour before finishing i always eat an hour before my workout and only have this issue with two scoops one scoop for me is perfect makes my face tingle helps me kill my workout i love this stuff so my recommendation is to try it in different dosages until you find your sweet spot maybe you are a 12 scoop person maybe you need the full two scoops ust dont try it once and say its not for you give it time give it a chance youll love it
i definitely need something else
not only are these very helpful when you have a sick child with the flu etcmy husband had open heart surgery over a month ago but when he came home from the hospital his electrolyteswhere still offi mixed one of these with water he drank it as his dr told him too when he called him to say howawful he was feeling this mommys bliss saved us a trip back to the hospital but put my husband back on track to recovering
i like it its smaller than most pill organizers which i prefer since i only take a few pills but honestly it isnt worth more than 34 wait for the price to go down because even paying 5 for this i thought i was overcharged if you really love the aesthetic of the rainbow go for it but if you need more space for vitamins and pills get something else
great for camping or your purse for any cleanups i dont think its worth the money though  theyre not so high quality that its worth it individual packing and natural is why i liked them but wont be repurchasing
only thing is i have a pacemaker and you cant use this product with a pacemaker therefore its useless to me  my husband loves it for his back and legs though  so it turned out as a great present  lol
these drops stopped the stingingitching immediately upon first use im pleased
very convenient and effective product
this provides a subtle as in very subtle differencei cant say that it was enough to justify the price but everyone is different in that area in addition everyones body is different and yours may respond better than minei definitely believe in the theory behind it but im the sort of person that cant wear certain watches because they stop or i touch light switches and get a little shock even when there is no activity that would cause it such as walking on a carpet creating static electricityso do give it a try this is one of those items that cant hurt and might help my hope is that it helps you more than its helped me best of luck to you
the flavor is great the price is ridiculous
