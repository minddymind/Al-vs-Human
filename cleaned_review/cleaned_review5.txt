these are a great option if youre a paleo fan and trying to eat only whole and natural foods are they like a candy bar like most 34healthy34 protein barsno definitely not and this wouldnt be for you i find the flavor good they satisfy my hunger for a few hours and they are great to have on hand for when you need a high protein snack and need something quick as they suggest you really should put them in the microwave for 10 secs before eating that makes all the difference they are a bit greasy when you first open the package which is a little odd to me but i just overlook it and dig in the texture is pretty hard unless you heat them up a bit the chocolate was my favorite but all 3 flavors are good the mint is pretty minty so if youre not a fan you likely wont enjoy it
been using these for all three of my kids for months now definitely recommend great product and super fast shipping
great scale but must be on a hard floor
love this product mixes easily and taste great  metabogreens is powerpacked with fruitsveggies spicesherbs and gives me the energy i thought id lostthanks biotrust
great product and quality purchased as gift they loved them love the colored tips
these jspa non binding socks are very soft and have no rough seams i have a neurovascular problem that causes pain and swelling in my feet and legs wearing regular socks often makes my feet hot causing the issue to worsen they are nice and thick and feel very cushy but dont make my feet sweat ive found that bamboo is much kinder and more breathable than cotton these socks dont cause indentations on my legs and feet after wearing them and being on my feet for several hours they are well made good quality socks and are as they claim i would definitely recommend them
normally i dislike anything that has a strong odor whether it be detergent fabric softener or dryer sheets  but these have a different sort of fragrance to them which isnt all that offensive and theyve left my clothing with a fragrance that isnt strong  i would buy these again
oil of oregano is a very potent antiviral and antibacterial  ive got oregano oil in a liquid bottle and in softgels  i cant tolerate the liquid unless its diluted because its so hot  these little tubes of oregano oil are convenient and taste good but you only get 50mg of oregano oil per tube  one softgel of oregano oil usually delivers about 150mg  if you dont want that much then these tubes are good alternative  i found that though they taste good getting all the oil out of the tube was impossible  theres always an amount left in the bottom
wish they had something like this years ago when our dog had spine problems  spent a lot of money taking her in for red light therapy sessions back theni saw this therapy belt and had to get it  i know what red light therapy does and how much it helps the body repair itself or increase circulationthis therapy belt is so easy to use  comes with velcro strips so i can have it on my belly around my shoulder or on my back  longer velcro strip for larger areas  smaller strip for going around elbows knees or anklesi like that it has an automatic 20 minute shut down timer  this way i know im getting the maximum benefit from this therapy belt but not over doing it  it is comfortable to have on so its easy to forget i do have it on and runningim doing this twice a day as recommended  i want to see if this will help with my lower back pain  i know itll take some time for me to notice any changes in my pain levelthis is so great to have  and to be able to use it on my dogs too  what a bonus that isive seen first hand how much red light therapy can help both humans and dogs  and im excited to keep trying this and to always have it on hand to use after surgeries too for faster healing
i cant say enough good things about this product ive never been able to stick to a workout routine this long not only do you feel hydrated before your workout but it helps with stamina and performance  it is cheaper on the beachbody website but if you have amazon prime its exactly the same price with beachbodys shipping cost plus you get it in two days with prime so i chose to order it here
my only complaint is these dont scrub off hard dried foods of wipe tables and counters but other than that these are great
the item was used one time and then it stopped working  it would not turn on so in the trash it went
the adhesion of the pads is very strong and will have to be removed using water if its too strong  the smell is not offensive  will make nice gifts as well
i dont recommend this product at all
this is an excellent product one hundred percent nonirritating to the skin cleans and rinses off thoroughly very gentle and mild however it is too expensive
easy to use and can also serve as a back scratcher
that the wipes are thick and not thin
cute for girls who loves playing saxophones
good product
i use fix tape often and this brand is not the best  it does not have a great adhesive  i perfer anchor brand
gave it a 3 because i havent tried it yet  gave it a three because the blue ring around the middle was plastic wheni thought it would be soft and flexible product  believe i will enjoy it though but i only use it on trips which i havebeen taking lately
the frames are heavier than expected the nose pieces dig into the sides of my can only where for a short amount of time
yes its a little pricey but it smells great  i think it cleans well and i love that there is also stain spray and sticks as well as softener
i have a dog and live in an area with high pollen  ive had these for 3 years and replaced the bulbs periodically in my house my allergies are not an issue i have 3 of these in the areas of the house that are most occupied  living room and bedrooms  the noise doesnt stop me from sleeping  its white noise  i knew there was an issue when one of them started making louder noises i replaced the bulb and the noise was gone these imo are effective  i also have one at work i brought these from my town home that had smaller rooms  im now in a house with bigger rooms  still seems to work well my mother bought these to reduce the smell of perm in her shop it minimizes it
these wipes are barely suitable for use they are tiny and dry they barely remove dirt i guess you get what you pay for
it seemed to work pretty well for the first year the batteries had to be replaced after 1 year give or take a few days so i was happy about that but one very disconcerting thing i noticed was that it would give me a different weight when it was moved to different areas of the floor which i then knew i wouldnt buy it again but then i started to notice inconsistencies between what my scale said and what my doctors office scale and even what my sisters bathroom scale weighed me i also used it to monitor the weight of a 13 yr old cat which is even more important to me than keeping track of my own weight now after less than only 2 years and its stopped working altogether which is completely unacceptable
ill first begin by saying that probably a good thing i didnt like this product therefore it didnt end up using it i say this because i would have ended up scarring the heck out of my face had i used it even onceheres what i did like about this productthe case the case was truly beautiful it was as if it were from i dont know the 40s or the 50s when they used to make things really well and a truly was beautifulthe price point for around 8 i thought that there was a lot within the set as far as various implements so therefore i thought insofar as money wise you got good bang for your buck as a consumerhere is what i did not like about this setextraordinarily extremely and exceptionally dangerous when im telling you these things are surgically sharp im telling you these tools are surgically sharp  you could so easily hurt yourself and certainly scar your skin using any of these tools and i would not recommend it for the removal of blackheads or relief of pimples  no one perhaps not even a trained professional could wield these tools in the safe mannerlastly one of the implements that i managed to pull out of course i stabbed myself in the process but thats beside the point the head of this tool fell off immediately when i pulled it out i looked everywhere on the floor for it couldnt find out where fell to this day havent found it cuz i thought to myself maybe id glue it back but even still a brand new item should not be falling off like that regardless if if youre easily able to glue it back on or not so thats why i say that it has the illusion of being high quality but the reality it really wasnt the highest quality producti suppose because of the beauty of it it could be a gift  but im telling you that it is so dangerous that i wouldnt recommend it to anybody and i certainly wouldnt buy it again
product does a pretty good job and they are much cheaper than custom havent found the perfect product but this one is better than most
this is a great little straightener if you understand that it is not intended to be your everyday straightener i bought it for camping i charged it in texas and i used it 7 days later in a colorado national park it still had a full charge but after using it for 15 minutes it was at 50 charge it says it heats up to 205c but it definitely does not get that hot i have fine straight hair already and this does the job for me but it will take at least twice the time as my regular babyliss i think someone with coarse curly or super long hair would be frustrated the plates are only two inches long i also plan to put it in my car for those times i want to freshen my hair after work or after working out it comes with a usb charging cord so i can charge it in my car overall it is a very good purchase if you use it for traveling or small touch ups
really helpful
this is a great natural product to help boost immunity i was constantly getting sick and needing bout after bout of antibiotics when a friend recommended immuplex to me i admit that it took several months before i noticed a real difference but once it kicked in it works like nothing else i rarely get sick and if i do im able to get over it much faster than before give it a try be patient and it will work

looks nice and works great on my metal door
i like these types of facial cleansing devices  i have 3 of them now and really like using them to exfoliate dead skin cells off my face  this one is gentle works well  i dont know how long it will hold a charge but my other two that are very similar hold a charge for a long time  i dont use any electronic facial devices except for this one and i think it does a good job at gently loosening up dead skin cells
the size is not 32 gallon more like 24 gallon will not fit any of my 4 small bathroombedroom trash cans the first bag tore in half when i tried to pull it off the roll the second split down the side when i tried to put it in a small 3 gallon trash can i will not buy them nor would i recommend them at any price
good solution and inexpensive
very handy for getting to those areas old age makes it hard to reach
no complaints about this turmeric powder the aroma when opening the bag was very rich the taste was also excellent and not at all muted as some turmerics ive used i use this mainly with rice or rice substitutes such as wheat berries couscous and the like and both the taste and the strong yellow color make for a tasty dishi like that while it is priced similar to a bulk item it comes in three fairly small 4 oz bags that allows for cost savings by buying in bulk but the smaller packages help maintain the freshness until its ready to be usedfresh tasty and a good value hits all the right marks
this eye mask is very comfortable and unlike my previous mask it genuinely blocks all of the light out my other one is made of contoured foam like this one but the inner padded design around the nose area is what makes the difference that is what prevents light from peaking in from the middle of the mask great design reasonable price
this a great little pack of sanding blocks  i also use this to sand cardstock for card making  but do love them to buff and smooth nails before adding polish
this product is really great and the price is excellent for the amount of mg per cap
i took off one star due to the cotton wrapping around each earplug it was very hard to get off it took a while for just one  i just found out why  it was very hot yesterday i opened one this morning only 70 in here now and the cotton came right off i added a star back on to 5  the cotton is not a problem  i think the reason noted in packaging for the cotton was not to use plastic more earth friendly however there was no need to wrap these in anything  i use macks they come open in a row they are a different material but same could have been done with these  i finally unwrapped one and it fit and molded into my ear nicely
super thick layers that really dont lie flat against your face found this mask to be fairly uncomfortable and always choose another over it
love these little drops  the taste is delightful and they work when i have occasional gas
oh gosh oh gee oh mymy sister was just saying they got her husband a foot massager at one of the membership club stores and that they felt it was a waste of money this one isnt even though i got it at a discount in exchange for a fair unbiased honest review i am amazed by this  i have never had a foot massage like this  it has a bunch of functions air pressure makes the massage harder or milder start out low and there is also a function that gives you the option of high and low levels of heat  there is also a kneading massage and a shiatsu massage as well as an air pressure massage and yes there is a major difference with the shiatsu massage hitting all sorts of areas between and around the areas that the kneading massage hits there is a timer and an auto function that cycles through other functions but that does not seem to include the shiatsu massage this is really really pink  it is also very high tech with glowing lights at the front the first thing i actually noted was how heavy it is the handle in the top of the box is really helpful the drawing says the covers in the foot areas are detachable but i didnt see how to detach them so suggestions would be welcomei dont want to wreck my new toy  or maybe it will be in another review  ive had it turned off for 10 minutes now and can still feel a difference in my feet and lower legs
my grandmother used to buy these and they really work and dont smell like the thing youre trying to cover up and food like most other sprays do  i dont want to smell something yummy and bathroom smells mixed together its disturbing thats why i like this stuff it does a good job of masking the smell and not being gross i have yet to get tired of it either  not sickly sweet or too floral it is a strong smell but not overpowering  very well balanced
this stuff actually works i use it to spray my gym sneakers and it neutralizes the scent it has very little scent itself too
i love music and as one of my favorite music professors always says live music is always better than dead musicjust in the past year and a half ive really started getting into the live concert scene let me rephrase that ive started getting into the live rock concert scene ive always been a frequent attendee of wind ensemble and orchestra concertsive also always have had a mild case of tinnitus or ringing in the ears this ringing is evidence of hearing damage and it irreversibleneedless to say going to rock concerts without hearing protection left me with a few nights of extraringing ears and almost certainly hearing damage as wellmore recently ive actually been experiencing perforations of my ear drum and even just this year a full burst because of all of this i decided to get my hands on a pair of ear plugsthe problem for me is that i cant just wear any old foam earplugs im a bit of an audiophile and those regular earplugs just make everything sound muffled which for me defeats a lot of the purpose of going to a live show in the first placethats where the downbeats come in they are a special type of ear plug that lets most of the sound profile in but cuts the volume to a safe level they advertise 18db noise reductionspoiler alert they really do work as advertised i wore them at a five hour metalcore concert this past weekend and im happy to report that i didnt have ringing ears after the show i also was able to hear all of the frequencies just quieter i could still feel the music and it wasnt quiet by any means but it was not a damaging loudnessone thing to note is that unfortunately these earplugs cut out conversation almost completely at a concert event conversations are hard at a concert event generally because of all the noise but these made it noticably harder to hear i found myself removing one plug if i wanted to talk to my friendsrelated to conversation these earplugs tend to make you talk even quiter than normal because of how they sit in your ear canal you end up hearing your voice pretty loud in your head so you talk quiter to other people with them in its really a minor inconvenience though considering that these save your hearing again you can just remove one when you feel the need to talk and that solves the problemthe downbeats fit pretty comfortably which is to say that i could wear them for the whole five hours of the show to me they feel like inear headphones you definitely notice a pressure in the ear canal but its not terribly unpleasant that means a lot from me because i despise in ear headphones because i find them incredibly uncomfortableluckily even though these earplugs sit very similar in the ear to inear headphones they stay in much better one of my biggest fears in getting fancy earplugs was that they would fall out while i danced jumped headbanged and otherwise moshed at the show i am happy to report that these earplugs stayed in very well and i never once had a problem with them slipping out or feeling loose these are earplugs that i would recommend for metal hardcore rock punk etc showsthe downbeats also dont stick out from the ear very far which is nice because you dont have to worry about catching a bump from the crowd and shoving the earplug too deep into the ear damaging the ear drum rock shows get intense this also means that the downbeats are pretty inconspicuous so you dont have to worry about everyone in the crowd knowing youre wearing earplugsi didnt have any problems removing the downbeats from my ears after the show although i have read reviews that said people did have some trouble with this the included carrying case is also a really convenient storage system for when you take the plugs out which is always a bonus its made of metal and could definitely take a beating although i didnt subject it to oneoverall these are highly recommended by me i liked everything about the product and i look forward to taking them to more shows in the future but even if you choose not to get this product or if it doesnt work for you wear earplugs to concerts people
this is the best stain remover ever
does the job removes the lint
when your physical therapist only gives you one sleeve per week this product is well worth the money so you can change your sleeve whenever you want to you can also snip a much smaller hole for your thumb so it stays on and lasts longer  after surgery on each thumb i needed to be in a brace for several months i love that i can make them the length i want  you can wash them but they come out all raveledjust cut yourself a new sleeve

i have used styling products my whole life but only started using a flat iron a few years ago  i like that one and yet thought there might be something better especially since ive been using the flat iron for both straightening and light waves of latei love the sleek all black look of this iron  its a little smallerslimmer than my old one and it has a nice long swivel cord  it heats up superquickly as promised and the auto shutoff is a nice feature  unfortunately the coloring of the temperature display makes it very difficult to read the numbers especially as i am getting ready in the morning without my reading glasses  note you will have to press both the power button and the temp button at the same time to switch the temperature reading from c to ffor straightening my hair i found that the iron generally performed well  i didnt really see any different between the floating plates of this iron and my old iron but still the iron worked well for my fine hair  i had more trouble using this iron to create waves  the sleek black case is aesthetically pleasing but has no real tractiongrip making it hard to twirl the iron for curling  although there are small grips at the end of the iron these arent tapered and dont work well at all  adding to the challenge is that the plates go all the way to the end so when gripping the tips and trying to turn the iron i burned myself several timesif you plan to use this iron for straightening only it may work for you but if you are looking for a more versatile styling product i would not recommend this iron
great bottles perfect for making recipes to use for the whole family the dark color helps to ensure those oils sensitive to direct light are protected roller heads snap in and work great

good item
used to line up my undercut  works like a dream  it cuts close and does not bite the skin  i also use on my brothers hair and he wants to steal it  nope get your own
i have loved this for years but the stores quit carrying itthey also changed the wrapper from black to white so i did not recognize it when it was aroundits fat free and quite delicious not like any other i have triedi came here looking for this because it really is my favorite and was thrilled to be able to stock up the six bottles arrived quickly and were carefully packed and doubleboxed
this product smells wonderful oddly as you can see the label claims it to be unscented and the listing claims it to be scented i believe it might be mislabeled but it doesnt matter because this product is very good you spritz it on to the stain and work it into the fabric after letting it sit for a couple of minutes run water through the fabric or blot with a wet clothi found that with most stains i had to do that twice but on the good side its clear that this is safe for a lot of hand washables as long as you are gentle and dont rub the stain too hardive had those big commercial brands of stain removers make things worse by fading the area that you spray them in that was not the case with this product it might not be as effective but its not going to damage your clothes if you have something delicate andor your clothes are a huge investment invest in this product as wellanother plus is that the 2 oz spray is good for travelso this might be a product that you need or another one might be best for you hopefully this review has helped you to decide
my father has macular degeneration this vitamin doesnt seem to help that much but then this supplement is meant as a preventive measure and is less effective once you have a deteriorating condition given that most of us are on our computer screens or cell phones for more than 10 hours a day i notice that i have more floaters when i dont take this vitamin its easy to swallow and best taken with food over the long term i dont know how effective it is but taking lutein for your eyes certainly cant hurt and im glad it works on my floaters
35 gallon white bucket  lid  durable 90 mil all purpose pail  food grade  contains no bpa plastic pack of 1 needed one for around the house it is nice and sturdy not to big nor to small for general use
i do not see the point of these brush straighteners they do not do the job like a proper flat one
used it daily for a month and saw no results i would add that this is oil so it makes your face look weird oily i wouldnt bother with it
this will fit large heads i have a 2375 head and this has plenty of stretch and adjustability it can easily go larger than my head measurementsthe soft foam cups are comfortable the exact fit will vary i find they block out all the light and unless i am resting my head in such a way to push on them there is very little light that will sneak through im a side sleeperthe soft foam cups allow the eyes to breathe lashes dont get smashed eye creams likely stay in placealthough stretchy and adjustable it is hard for me to find that sweet spot where it isnt too snug that it creates creases come morning nor too loose that it doesnt fall off migrate away from my eyes i found the snug fit worked better as it kept the mask from rotating in the night and off my eyes but i wake with indents i cant have thatother aspect that has troubled me is that sometimes it gets caught in my hair the spot that has the adjustment hardware is prone to snagging my hairso i go back to my old trust stand by which is a tube of material it looks like a headband and it continues to be my most favorite sleep mask of all time if it rotates it doesnt matter because it is a tube so i am always covered  i have been using nightly since i got it 6 months agowwwamazoncomdpb07rjqgv61this one by cyraneme is a close second though comfort quality adjustability and the fact that it can actually fit large heads are all positives in my opinion the rotation and the indents and hair snag is variable depends on if i can find that sweet spot for fit i definitely have tried other sleep masks that i never used ever again this i will use it is still at my bed side
im a small guy at 165lbs so it took some breaking in for this cushion to finally give my hamstrings some reliefbut now i cant drive without it if youre a truck driver and youre looking for a cushion this is the one you want to get as all others wont cover the dimensions of the factory truck seat

i recently had gum surgery so having the opportunity to test this toothpaste came at the right time this toothpaste has a very nice refreshing taste and cleans the teeth it is kind of a yellowish color gel  it tastes fresh but is mild so it doesnt burn or sting the gums as some toothpastes do  it is the perfect tooth product to use after dental surgery but it is really a pleasant toothpaste to use especially if you have sensitive gums  highly recommend

please dont waste your money on this it doesnt work
i honestly cannot say i have really used it to vouch that its sturdy on any actual use but i can say that when i received it i inspected it thoroughly and i found it to be very sturdy the snap on the outside of the case snaps very securely  doesnt pop open wthe slightest touch the size is perfect especially for a 4 compartment sleeve ive always found that either the individual compartments are really small or really big if im gonna be out for the day i will take the sleeve for that day in my bag  bc of the bright colors i dont have to rummage through my bag to find it impressive bc my bag is always full of a bunch of junk i also have times where i will be gone for several days so i will take the whole case  it fits in my bag wno problem even wall of my junk in itso im really happy wit for 2 reasons 1 the bright colors have made my life so much easier to find wout having to take everything out of my bag2 i really like the fact that there is an outer case that snaps securely so i dont worry about dropping it  all the individual sleeves popping open  then have to spend 15 minutes on trying to find every single pill which usually involves moving all of my furniture bc my floor is hardwood so i dont even have carpet to help it stay relatively in the same area where i dropped them
i had read that lavender was a natural deterrent to moths we had been experiencing a moth problem in our older condo we had just moved into it seems to be working and we love the fragrance of lavender this product is far more preferable to mothballs

the arlo cameras i purchased about 3 years ago are notorious for consuming battery life ive purchased many different brands of batteries since becoming an owner of arlo cameras and the energizer cr123a have had the absolute worst performance in a pack of 50 not one set lasted more than 6 days range 36 days compare this to disposable tenergy batteries which consistently lasted an average of 25 months and titanium batteries which lasted an average of 7 weeks ive also purchased a number of brands of rechargeable batteries which last anywhere from 4 days to 2 weeks before requiring a recharge this may have been just this particular package but im unlikely to try energizer again
i used this for like an hour today alone on different spots it isnt too rough or too slow well the slowest speed it a tad slow so i went with medium speed my neck and upper back feel so nice right now it is pretty light weight so you can carry it around in your car and it comes with a car adapter too which is neat the heat really is not warm at all i can tell it is there but only if i walk away and come back with it on it didnt do much though but i really like this and will definitely be using it a tonupdate please be careful how you use it do not really lean on it too hard i actually got bruised twice using it i still use it because it does feel good just have to be careful how i use it lol
as expected
i thought the flavor was going to be blahactually it doesnt have a taste to me

these are pretty good pillboxes the lids are really secure and they have a decent amount of space they work great but theres one problem once you put the pills in them the only way to get them back out is to completely dump the box upside down i have skinny fingers and i still cant get them out and of course dumping it means that i drop pills more times than not its a design flaw for sure but the product still does a great job otherwise
this is a nice blend of essential oils for aromatherapy in a rollon tube the directions say to apply a small amount to the temples and behind the ears the inside or outside of the wrists or just inhale deeply i used this several times already and love the fragrance but dislike that the aroma wears off in less than 30 minutesit is made in the usa i am not sure where the ingredients are from the ingredients are pure sweet orange bergamot lavender and cedarwood essential oil in a base of fractional coconut oilthe tube does not say this is vegan even though the amazon site says thatif this lasted longer i would have rated this 4 or 5 stars
i  like this but handle needs to be 4 inches  longer 
ive been taking a coq10 supplement for the last several years mainly because its very good for heart health  these gelcaps are big but not too hard to swallow and only one per day is the dosage  im not a coq10 expert but as far as i can tell these are good quality and i have no reservations in taking them

i occasionally get migraines and they last all day and dont go away for anything its miserable and nothing ive tried makes it any better i got this ice roller and it helps with the pain and throbbing so i can at least eat something and get on with my day the rolling part comes off so you can put that in the freezer and leave the handle out theres a notch on both sides of the circle that make it easy to pull off the handle and you dont scratch up the roller its easy enough to put it back on and get rolling
it works  easy to apply doesnt damage fabric  disposable is very convenient
no complaints at all about this silicone scar sheets the material is nicely durable and peels off the backing without issue it adheres very well i use this on the back of my hand and it stays put for the whole day without a problem despite the good adhesion it is not painful to remove and it leaves no residue behindthe size is well suited to small areas so that you dont need to waste any in trimming the cost per inch or foot is quite good since this comes in a 120 inch 10 foot roll it stores well  the roll i received in january 2022 has an expiration date of september 2024im not sure of the country of manufacture it is distributed by a french company but it doesnt specifically state where it is madeno complaints its a good quality silicone sheet that works well and is a good value pricewise five stars

great product use for my bunnys litter box
this is great that it has so many different shaped wells for meds  i think my pills were just too small and over 50 of them ended up being crushed  it will probably work perfectly on larger pills
its an expensive toothpaste i was interested because i watched a videoblog of a redheaded american girl in japan saying what theyve got that we dont  and one of the things was toothpaste like this because it fills in holes or somethinganyway i use it and i have no holes in my teeth since i started using it 3 weeks ago
the shampoo is very good the lid is a bit shaky as im sure other reviews probably state but the shampoo is very good it gets right into your scalp and works so well on all that annoying dandruff my scalp is very dry and upset with pretty much any type of weather all year round currently its mad at the sun and the end of summer weather i used this and after three uses if felt and looked quite a bit better i still have dandruff but its an ongoing battle and this shampoo is really helping in the fighti would recommend giving this a shot if you are having some issues it does help the lid is not the best made and it can leak a little but its still worth it just be careful with the lid
cleans pontoon boat easily
hoping it solves the hard water problem
this product isnt for you if you dont like sweet potatoes the bar is basically a sweet potato fruit bar its all of the nutrition you want from the real thing in a portable form you can take these on hikes throw them in a bag or keep them on hand for emergency food id definitely recommend this as an alternative to high sugar barsthanks so much for taking the time to read this review  i hope the information that ive provided helps make your decision a little easier

better than some i have had as far as strength but the shape and size is not great for mens shoes needed to be a bit wider  i think that was my problem not the companys better for womens shoes
bought this for the wife one of several over the last year  she loves it amazon has the best selection
my work requires a lot of hand washing and hand wringing but i need an accurate watch not connected to my arm that i can check often this is marvelous the watch hangs from the lanyard when i need to measure time or tucks into my shirt pocket when i do not the watch is accurate and seems rugged enough to last
nice small massager  sometimes it hits a little too hard for my tastes but i just adjust my body and it works well  i like the option to have heat or not  it also has a stretchy strap that can be added to your chair  i have mine wrapped around a sturdy pillow and put it behind me on the sofa
terrible product ive tried to use it several timesevery time its completely messed up my nails the fingers are too long and bulky great ideabut dont bother if you have small hands
i have ordered these supplements several times  they always come quickly and are a very easily absorbed calcium with other trace minerals
i have found these to be really great at taking advantage of all the health benefits of coconut oil i am not a huge coconut oil fan taste wise but these are just fine and i can take them no problem i do find at three pills a time that it is a bit much to take especially with the pills being big i noticed a little bit of an energy boost so far but thats about it i just really like that i can safety take it while breastfeeding and it can still help me lose the baby weight
works as expected
this is a small pack of lozenges with a lot of zinc which is a proven ingredient for speeding ones recovery from flus and colds the price is somewhat high for the amount you get but it seems to work overall its ok but i still prefer airborne which is a better value
the picture of the product is completely misleading this looks like a gold and orangish red and it is not in actuality you are getting orange and a very dark red i was going to use this for a tiger face palette because the white often can be a problem in the orange yellow and white palette dont know what i will use this for i love the quality of the paints by this company so i will find a use for them
i got this flavored sparkling water with the dragon fruit flavor before i drank it it was nicely chilled sadly this did not help the overall experience i know it has a lot of good for you ingredients but sadly i couldnt stand this beverage at allit says zero calories zero sweetener zero carbs zero sugar but sadly i have to say horrible flavorto me this is a complete miss i struggled drinking one can of this and now i have 11 more in my fridge i wish this would have been better now i wish i would have gotten the variety pack to see if any of the other flavors would have been better but i didnt
my husband has chronic dry eyes he loves these wipes says nothing he has used helps as much
you use more elbow grease to get things clean then the actual product cleans may as well use a lemon and salt for all the scrubbing that you have to do
long and sturdy brush thats easy to clean works great and quality looks long lasting
works really well was surprised at how easy they cut my nails
i purchased over 20 pairs of these  for my various shoes to reduce my plantar fasciitis pain they never stick permanently but they work well for me however these arch supports look and feel nicer i particularly love the heartshaped design i also tried similar arches  but now i am liking this betterthere are two pairs in this package it is perfect for a tall arch like mine and they feel very comfortable in my sneakers they do have an adhesive backing but i do not expect them to stick forever so far they provide me with good support i might purchase these in the future over my dr scholls or the other ones i just tried they are all good to me
as long as i have to use a cane it might as well be pretty  and this cane is pretty as well as affordable  i love it
i love method products we were always huge tide fans but i tried method once and had to make the switch  great at getting out stains even if you forget to pretreat and seems like it leaves clothes looking 34newer34 less pilling of the fabric even when something is washed frequenyly  very nice subtle fragrance  bottles take up almost no space on the shelf  easy to dispense
taste good quite costly but dairy free which i needed
great support stockings will buy again great price fast shipthank you
great smell but spray button does not work
they do a great job i just wish they lasted longer
this nose clip is useless  it doesnt stay on
was hoping this would help with the pain in the ball of my foot but it ended up hurting me more from the elastic around the pad the pain from this overrode the pain in my foot and caused more pain for me very uncomfortable and will need to find something else what a waste of money
perfect for sunburn itchy or dry skin
this is very small  now i put this in my bedroom as i wanted to see if it would bother me at night and whether or not it would work to clean the air  i do have sinus issues and for some reason at night my nose will clog up and then ill get up blow my nose lay back down breathe easy for a while then clog up again  i am assuming i have some dust or other allergen in the air thats bothering me  after plugging this in and setting it where i wanted on the table next to my bed the sound is very quiet and for several nights in a row while using this air purifier i did find that my nose didnt clog up nor did i have to get up to blow my nose during the night  does that mean this machine is working  i would have to say yes since it is the only thing that changed in my room for those nights  i will try it in the kitchen the next time i burn something and create some lingering smoke in the room  im very curious to see if it works like their video shows  based on its use in my bedroom i would say this air purifier works very well
the other reviews about a medicinal metallic smell were right i should have listened  im not a fan of this one  would not put in my drink  its okay for defusing  just doesnt smell right
purchased this chair from the buyer and after a few months it began fading to now a  year later the chair has completely lost its color  upon further research and seeing other sellers offer warranties for the chair i contacted this seller only to send a very rude email stating for me to  wash chair with soap and water  the chair is not worth what you are paying  especially when other sellers offer warranties  please do yourself a favor and dont purchase this chair from this seller  find another who will back up there product with warranty
works well as described

this nail file is small enough to carry in your purse it is a little thicker than some other crystal nail files which also makes it more sturdy i prefer the thinner crystal nail files generally but this does a good job as files go
its bathroom cleaner what more can i say
great tissues nice and soft and sturdy
i tried nervine tonic after watching a video from a notable herbal company which touted the products effectiveness  i cannot deny that the product worked as a relaxant and sleep aid  however i did find that my sleep was almost too deep and i had trouble waking up  because of this i would use with caution and be extremely diligent with dosage
i have reviewed before  i was totally disappointed as this did not work on my glasses  one side or another kept sliding off
i stand all day at work and so got these to go in a pair of dressier shoes that i have to wear occasionally my feet are slightly fatigued after standing on these all day but its significantly better than the shoes by themselves would recommend
stopped working after 1 month
i have been taking 1000mg of another type of magnesium this is only 400 but must have superior bioavailability because i only need a single 400mg caplet awesome

this handy little hair remover works just as well as the more expensive one out there it leaves the skin smooth and hair free with no stubble makeup goes on so much better its quick and easy to use great purchase
these are very cute and were sent very quickly yes they do have big tags that can be removed in a few minutes from the whole set  get over it  yes mine were patterned in the horizontal instead of the vertical  not an issue for me in a hair scrunchie  oh and they fit my averagesized woman wrist easily  i get compliments whenever i wear one and am doing the good fairtrade thing
theres less static than other stuff ive tried cloth sheets dryer balls etc but theres still a ton of static in my laundrynot sure if maybe i need two of them kinda pricey so ill have to wait to get another in the future
the cloths comes off the holder too much trouble to use
i love these theyre great i use it on sore muscles  onmmy face every day and night works very well  is very effective i love that it has 2 to chose from
im only giving it four stars instead of five because all the pills from both bottles fit into one so its kind of a waste of bottles but this is a great supplement no garlic taste afterward and they go down like a breeze
bought them for my grandma  a non mobile senior  they are too small to put them in the bes before going to sleep i saw reviews that they work but now im looking for a bigger size
these are great smell wonderful  got them as gifts for friends at xmas  they loved them
i took this product to my physical therapist she tried to put it on and had great difficulty it did not fit it does not go low enough to support the back as well as pull the shoulders back one person alone would have difficulty my therapist does not recommend this product nor do i i returned the product the feedback i received from the seller said they are made to not go lower as people have big belliesmy therapist said she does not recommend any type of device as they are too difficult for the user to put on especially one with pain
the product does last longer and is stronger than the original formula
i think this mix did give me a little extra energy the other day when i had two tennis practices nearly back to back  i have tried this mix several times and though i havent noticed a jolt in energy i didnt get overly fatigued either especially while playing in the hot sun  it mixes well with plain water though it seems to settle out a little bit if left to sit in the glass for a while  the flavor is not all that good  it has a strong almost bitter flavor that i dont really care for  i have since started mixing this with another electrolyte mix that has a sweeter and more pleasant flavor  i like the combination and it really keeps my electrolyte level up when sweating and exercising in the heat
very disappointed these were the first pair of shears for me as i am a nursing student  these could barely cut through two layers of gauze
noisy and ineffective all it did was pull at my poor cats butt furs and make him real mad the clipper guard was too long to even touch his hairs and the product came with no other sizes
i lift a lot both at the gym and at work this gives me great back support i like the fact that its adjustable so when i need more or less support i can adjust as needed i had this on while sitting as well and it helped me sit upright  proper posture im sure if i continue wearing it for the great  back brave it is i might see my waist shrink as well but the sole reason i bought this was for my back i was fortunate enough to purchase this item at a discounted price in return for my honest opinion
maintains sharpnessreasonable price
i have not yet been able to figure out how to have the light come on at the time that i want it to i have been through the poor instruction book that came with it but cant figure out how to program the  thing to work the display light is a bit too bright for when the lights are off and the nature sounds are annoying i think you need to keep looking if you are looking for a lamp that slowly lights up in the am
this pain relief cream from the appropriately named dr paine didnt work that well for me there is a slight menthol scent and the lotion is absorbed quickly without leaving much residue which is a good thing however it seems ineffective for strong back pain for some reason i associate strong smelling creams with higher potency  since this one is mild it doesnt seem to have much impact the positive thing is that you can apply the cream and go out without someone noticing a strong scent however i prefer ben gay for providing stronger pain relief this one is just meh
im new to wood repair kits but our contractor suggested using this sort of kit to hide small cracks and scratches  depending on the depth of the scratch i used the wax crayon first and then the marker to cover the color  i used this on our older scratched furniture and on the wood accents on our window sills  not too difficult although it takes some time to get used to the materials  it did help make scratches less visible so the kit was worth it for us
it works great i thought it would be horrible quality bc its so cheap but its actually great not too rough on the skin and very smallcompact make sure to charge before you use
the glasses arrived in 10 days from china to the west coast well packed in perfect condition they included a sturdy trim little black zippered case and a microfiber cleaning clothi bought these after reading an article about ways to increase energy apparently looking at electronic screens exposes you to a blue light that tends to keep you in awake modewhich means itll be difficult to sleep when you want to an hour or so later yellow or orange tinted lenses block the blue light decreasing eye strain and allowing you to fall asleep more naturallyeven if you tend to be eyeing those screens right up until bedtime like i dothey seem to work and the magnification is fine im buying another pair for work
this broth is not going to be salty or flavorful enough for most peoplemixing a scoop into any big bowl of soup however adds a boost of healthy benefitsan added plus is that many ingredients are organic such as the spices and flavormaking my own bone broth is a process that takes forever and every minute of that process means that my dogs are whining because they know something good is cooking its easier on everyone when you can just take a scoop and mix it into hot water or soupim in my sixties and always get comments on how youthful my skin looks for my age part of it is the serums and moisturizers but a big part of it is taking collagen prior to using this i used the amy myers md chicken broth im more than satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of both
there is no surprise toy the only toy are the 3 egg toys its not actually toys inside of the bath bombs though our nephew was extremely let down to find this out
i was very excited for these to arrive as ive been looking for an affordable back massage tool when i opened the package i was so disappointed at what i actually received the tools looked as if they were put together halfhazardlythe legs of the massager were uneven for some reason they were all slightly different lengths so i couldnt even use it effectively the wood coating was also messy and not smooth at all there were globs and bubbles of dried coating on the wooden surfacei know this was a relatively inexpensive massager but i cant even enjoy at least one use so in my opinion i would certainly recommend spending a little more for a better quality product
really great size because there are 4 sections  even if you take lots caps there is so much room
this scale is perfecti ordered and received it almost faster than if i purchased at a king size pharmacy or some suchinexpensive with fast deliveryless spent than if l had to drive to purchaseand the best part is the product is accurate and well made buy oneyou will be pleased
small size makes it easy to store in purse or desk drawer works well
sneak those crazy beet nutrients into your yogurt or curry and fool even yourself and never waste another calorie with useless seconds of chewing aplus nice beety flavor too
very inexpensive for what you get seems well constructed and high quality for the price and the ribbon to hang it is quite sturdy
my white vehicle had road tar in several areas this product was great removed all the tar after consistent pressure with a microfiber towel highly recommended
 re the orange permanent deafmaker ear plugs aka lets go to the er at 5am plugs i put the orange plugs in and went to sleepat 4am i woke up with pain in my left ear i remove the right plug and try to remove the left plug but the clear plastic nib comes out and leaves the plug in my earfor the next hour i try to pull the plug out but i cant its painful and im worried i need to go to an emergency room without the clear plastic nib its impossible to grab onto i try tweezers but i cant get a gripat 5am i wake up my neighbor and ask them for help he tries the tweezers but it doesnt work we decide to gently insert a wooden toothpick into the hole where the clear plastic nib used to be and after about 30 minutes of very careful jiggling we get it outi crymy neighbor consoles me we go to bed i cant sleep my adrenaline has been activated i normally wake up at 9am so i lost 5 hours of sleep that nightthis is dangerous and should never be sold to consumers re the gummy silicone earplugs these are the most usable but they worry me they arent effective unless the gummy part extends into the ear canal which youre not supposed to do based on the directions but if you do this it forms a vacuum seal and does pretty good at keeping sound outthe issue is that if you so much as tap your ear youll feel it on your ear drums because of the seal you have to be very very very careful when you pull these out or youll rupture your eardrumsif you put them in like youre supposed to just covering the outside of the ear canal they let almost all of the sound in still they cant be used safely in my opinion and i recommend not using them in an unsafe way just to get them to work i was desperate and so i did it the unsafe way but dont do what i did re the other earplugs the grey bombshaped ear plugs were not effective at all for me they sat in my ear and let all the sound in still they have clear plastic fins on them to pull them out and although mine didnt break like the orange earplugs did i would still be afraid of them being a safety hazard if they did breakthe blue christmastree shaped earplugs seem the safest they are all one piece of rubber and so it seems like a very low risk of breaking and you can safely insert them and they seem to work the only issue is theyre not really meant to block sound so much as reduce volume so i can still hear snoring construction work etc plus they have a long piece that sticks out and prevents you from putting your ears on your pillow comfortably if you sleep on your back or you dont use them for sleeping they would be fine id recommend this pair to you if you just need to reduce noise and not block it out completely and dont sleep on your side quick summary except for the blue christmas tree shaped earplugs i would recommend you just throw these ear plugs in the trash so you dont hurt yourself
there arent quite as many decorations included in this pack as expected but its perfect for decorating a smaller room or entranceway i didnt have any issues with defective balloons etc the mylar balloons were a hit with the kidsid definitely recommend this for any halloween party or for halloween night
uncomfortable but better hold than pro version
this product was priced very well but isnt top quality that being said what you do get is a nice cheap way to incorporate cupping into your massage practice you get quite a bit in size options so thats very helpful and they do maintain good suction the only thing i dont like is that over time the plastic cups show signs of being brittle and some have cracked they did last me quite a while for being so cheap so i cant complain i wasnt looking for a big investment so for the price it was worth it to me and i use it as my practice set i did enjoy the cupping procedure and the pump handle really lets you control the strength of the suction quite well so if youd like to try out cupping but dont want to invest in an expensive kit this one is the one for you the cupping technique has helped me with my shoulder pain as it really breaks up adhesions and gives more blood flow to the area i place the cup on a sore spot and suction the skin about half way up the cup and let it stay for a few minutes like that another technique is to put massage oil on the area of your skin first then suction it a little less than half way and then slide the cup around youtube has some great tutorials
heres the thingthese will not last you like a regular sponge so i had to get over that factheres what they willliamson do  theyll get in the tight spots clean the crappy chrome around your faucets better than anything in the market with less effor they get into nooks and crannies its their thing also good on mirrors  i keep them in the bathrooms and kitchen stainless steel rims etc look like new now
works as advertized
i have a sensitivity to tags and seams in clothing placing this over them has saved me on numerous occasions from wanting to crawl out of my skin
bought for my wifei have not heard her say any thing negative about it so i guess she is happy
good ingredients but hard to stay put on the gum ends up just a sawdust mouth experience where you have to spit it all out and rinse  hmm wish they made this in a gel form or paste or something other than powdered herbs
its as thick as the name brand and about the cost as you would pay at a box store but slightly less expensive then the name brand you can buy here
i actually bought this just for the blades i have a callus shaver but to buy the blades by themselves cost more than this set i gave the shaver to a friend with a blade installed she is pleased with it
i really liked it i gave it to my family member for them when they buy their new home
im on my second box of this  it makes the fermented vegetables have a much better flavor than run of the mill fermented veggies  i use the recipe recommended adding juiced celery and also add some himalayan salt  super tasty
greater magnification but shorter depth of field wouldnt work for my computer use so i returned them
comes in handy
work great for my husband  very well made
cinnamon mouthwash is a must in our household  my husband loved cinnamon listerene but that is no longer sold  so i found this  he actually preferred the lavoris  he said it has great flavor not too much alcohol just right
this swag is pretty but it is not as pictured the picture is showing purple and some pink  what i received is nice and full but it is all purple i might get more silk flowers to add to it because the one color is boring to me i put it on my front door
highly recommend great taste and great buy
had this unit for over a year now and its very quiteoriginally bought this to try to eliminate the cigarette odors that would come from downstairs neighbors who enjoy smoking on their porch on hot summer nights when youve your window open it worked okay wouldnt eliminate all but it definitely cut the odors downsince then weve moved to a smaller apartment and this unit is now by the cats litter box again though it cuts down on the odors it doesnt eliminate it all together actually feed your kitties those cat grass helps much more
i personally had one and sent to mom another one i didnt see any benefits from it myself i didnt feel it doing anything about the pain at all it was soothing to massage into my body and it doesnt have an offensive smell but as for ending pain not helpful mom said it was okay and it worked ok for her but she hasnt asked me to get her another one so i think it is not a completely fail but it is not worth it to get again
these tasty and nutritious bars are worth the price they are filling there is no chocolate in them just carob they do have mik and peanut butter however
these are excellent boxes for presenting gifts in  they are made of good white cardboard that have a nice sheen and a good texture  they are very easy to fold into a box and no instructions are necessary  just fold on the creases and slide the tabs into the slots on the bottom  i wouldnt put a particularly heavy object in them since the tabs and slots are all that keep the bottom intact  these boxes make a perfect cube shape
very poor quality
i apologize for not saying so sooner my fibromyalgia has good days and bad it is also extremely hot down here so i try not to be on amazon too long because i spent too much money lol but truly it is a beautifully crafted piece i use t for head piece during full moon rites but i do love it i plan to take a peek around your shop soon ty
exceeded my expectations i bought this for camping and travel we were able to put three large duffle bags air mattresses blankets and sleeping bags in it  everything stayed dry that left room for camping supplies in my toyota highlander and five passengers i used ratchet tie downs in addition to the ties included  put a rag under each ratchet to insure no rubbing  i also put tarps in the bottom of my hitch haul to insure that the hitch haul bolts did not wear holes in the bag  worked perfectly
very inaccurate readings do not buy waste of money
these pads are super thick and high quality they dont leak heavy duty i wish they were larger and less expensivei use them as dog pads for 2 small dogs not sure how they hold up for bed protection for people but they are the best quality ive ever gotten
my girlfriend used it on a burnt pot and it did a good job after seeing the results i wanted to get it for myself in case i need it
i bought these socks as gifts for nurses day they were awesome
i am a big believer in aromatherapy so i decided to try this one out  it smells amazing and it has helped me relax into a deep sleep  its very convenient to just spray it on my sheets before bedtime  i will definitely order again soon
bright colors
i struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water and ive never found other flavored waters or flavored drops to be enjoyable as you can always taste an overly sweet fake flavor i received a bottle of coconut water drops as part of a birthday gift and i became obsessed with just a squeeze or two of these infusion drops i can drink bottle after bottle of water and it fits into my new zerosugar lifestyle the only downside is the pricea bottle of water infusion drops lasts me less than two weeks so its pricey to keep up with my obsession though the fact that these drops make my water so yummy that i avoid soda probably makes it worth it
these are a decent option if you are looking for a reusable period product they are easy to use and clean but i do find them a bit bulky i like that the inner lining is black so i dont have to worry about stains
it does have an easy to read dial works better for me than digital as i am handicap and its difficult for me to step up straight on there course the only thing i dont really care for is my weight as it says what i really am lol
easy to make
this avcoo 4 channel tens unit for pain relief is not for me i got this for upper back pain the caution part says where my pain is could cause rhythm disturbances which could be lethalthe box comes with a muscle stimulator machine it has 12 electrode pads it also comes with cables a drawstring bag and instructionsi will not be recommending this avcoo 4 channel tens unit for pain relief to family and friends
quality product  just as advertised  works perfectly  will buy from here again
great tissues for cold and allergy seasons

i always  try to buy this brand of tissue
works great and very well made
some people just cant sleep with total silence i can my wife cannot and we have a hard time finding something that we can both accept she wants the tv on it keeps me awake i like soft music it keeps her awake this tabiger white noise machine has so many options we found something that works for both of us the sound of waves gently lapping on the shore if you dont like that theres air conditioner train sounds rain frogs crickets a crackling fire birds soft piano music instrumental lullaby and more even just simple white noise the quality of the sound is very good and the multimode night light is a nice touch if you need sound to sleep soundly i recommend this device five stars
product was supposed to include 4 rubber feet mine only came with one
my favorite paper towel  very absorbent and i love that it feels like cloth
the socks are very well made and provide a lot of compression at first wearing maybe a little too much but after wearing them a few  times they are very supportive and not quiet as tight
shipping r  l carriers 626262top notch i was very concerned about this after reading some of the reviews here use the tracking number provided by amazon on the r  l carriers website my chair arrived 5 days early relax they do call you the day before and a signature is required i tipped the driver 20 to wheel the palletpackage into my garage for the night he came at 700pm  treat the man nice and hell probably do the same for you  just dont expect him to bring it into your house hes really not suppose to go further than the edge of your driveway where you put your trash canssetup the driver gave me some awesome advice leave the chair in the box when you bring it in the house yes believe it or not by doing it this way i was able to get this 244 pound beast inside all by myself  the secret is to slide the box where it is possible and 34walk34 the box where it is not for my 4 step porch i laid down a plywood sheet for a temporary ramp the shipping straps made excellent handles and your chair will have protection all the way to your mancave try it  you can always resort to cutting the box open if it doesnt work outassembly again some reviews had me nervous no sweat take your time 34eyeballing34 it the 34nonremovable34 retainer clips were already installed on the postsnot suppose to be but they were to solve the chinese puzzle gently insert a small flat blade screwdriver in the very middle twist slightly slip the clipretainer off the post gently it may take you 3 hands 5 minutes or both these are suppose to be oneshot retainers and they will break easilythere were no spares next get the leg assembly as close as possible connect the 3 colorcoded pneumatic hoses and 1 electrical connection first moistenlube the air connection fittings it will help slip the leg assembly support rings on the posts one at a time then reinstall the retainer clips the ac power and controller cables easily connect on the bottom back of the chair youre now ready for lift offthe ride holy smokes no buyer remorse here  this thing will have you smiling  heaven on your back and kinky on your ass another reviewer put it perfectly 34it works your butt over like a greek34 warning do not use more than 20 minutes 5 minutes in one specific area yes you will be tempted to ride all day but like a hot tub be sensible and dont over do it enjoy
when you cant get in the shower and want to feel refreshed or just clean these are really good to have around thick enough that you wont easily drive your fingers through the material but thin enough to be usable ok scent useful cloths
i had recommended sleeves like these for my boyfriend to offer ankle support and compression i own other types of sleeves like these that help me with my plantar fasciitis nevertheless he tried these and says they are very very comfortable he likes them as socks but says they do not offer any support or compression i tried them on and they are too big on me i got size 1315 and he takes a 13 shoe so these were the right size for himhe personally does not understand why they are open toe and neither do i nevertheless he likes them for other reasons other than what they are advertised for to him these are five stars for comfort but they do not hold up to the support claims therefore look elsewhere for ankle support
i looked endlessly for brushes that had a cleaning tip particularly one that worked well this is the answer  the cottonlime top gets everything clean  love these brushes
i loved the swarovski crystals  it was fun to have so much bling on my ears  the adhesive didnt stick well in areas on a ridge  also on each ear one of the crystals moved to the point of revealing the gold pellet underneath  i didnt mind they still looked pretty  be aware that some people such as myself react poorly to gold  i wont be able to use these for myself again and the crystal styles currently only come with gold plated pellets
worked great
works real good
this laptop table works great
why take a product that is so simple to use and complicate it so much i followed the directions and could not get it to heat up it might work great but i dont have the patience to figure it out so am returning it
this appears to be the right sponge for my wand but is isnt i bought these in november and having run out of the sponges i had i reached int the cupboard and grabbed a  new sponge wow im i disappointed  it doesnt fit my wand the shape of the sponge is correct but the base is wrong its way past 30 days so i cant return them maybe i can find a new wand but really what a pain be careful check the base not only the sponge
ok to use with adult supervision in case kids wanted to step on fragile cause glass
this does nothing to make foundation smoother if anything it makes it look like i have tried to put makeup on with a plastic bag
i love this stuff  im not sure of its health benefits but it has great flavor and is a healthier alternative than a lot of other additives to water
let me just start from the beginning first the packaging for this is super cute and totally is what drew me to this energy supplement the packaging draws you in and the name itself totally makes you want to see what this is then you read cherry bomb and i was totally intrigued and it sounds like it would be an awesome flavor this stuff ticked all my boxes on looks and drawing me inhowever when i opened it and smelled what was in this nope nope oh heck to the nope nope i have to be completely honest i cant even tell you what it smelled like because its not something ive ever smelled yeah tells you exactly what it is huh i know its driving me crazy too because its this strong striking scent that you think you know but then when you think about it you really have no idea then i tried it worst mistake ever its like battery acid meets stomach bile except id rather drink that the worst part is while i was very hesitant to even try this after smelling it i was like ive tried things that smelled horrible tried it and honestly it was awesome however me being dumb and super thirsty i ended up downing half a bottle before wanting to rip my tongue out its messed up because it started out totally fine until you stop drinking and then the smell turns into the taste my tongue is still mad at me and i dont blame it i still have remnants of the smell and then it reminds me of the taste and i spit up a bit yeah its gross its more than gross seriously dont buy this stuff and being someone that drinks zero sugar drinks and sugarfree stuff its not this being sugarfreeon another note i wish everything came with the little scoops that glytch uses its a scoop and funnel in one and is totally genius so at least i got a super awesome scoop out of this horrid stuff

these are the cheapest piece of crap you could by  the sleeve itself doesnt stay in place and the padding inside is a piece of itchy scratchy egg crate foam  there is no cover on the foam  i cannot believe this item has gotten such rave reviews  i will be posting a video to show you the quality or lack of it with this product  you are better off buying something else like futuro which is what i am using now for my ulnar nerve issues which have been bothering me both day and night  the futuro elbow support has been working great and i highly recommend it
i am very happy with this product i hate taking bulky vitamins and trying to remember how many to take this is a convienent and easy fit in my fast paced lifestyle it has no flavor and is a very fine powder this makes it easy to add to shakes yogurt or oatmeal the only thing i didnt like was the resealable bag it came in because it doesnt close well i just ended up putting the product in another container  this has been the best way for me to add these essential nutrients to my diet thank you
my hubby and i use the product to relaxand help with sleeping product works wellwell order again
this is the third time i have bought this product the sticks that were in the bottle were no longer working the sticks in the pouch did work but that meant 100 sticks did not on opening

very cheesy and crunchy the biggest problem is that i couldnt stop eating once i started
it arrived on time nice product clean smell
good stuff  as advertised
before you buy fan australian bush flower essence for this kind of a price do shop around
i got this to replace a plastic sterilite stool i used to get into my very high bed  the plastic stool had cracked and was unsafe this stool is heavy duty sturdy and stable it came fully assembled in an extra thick cardboard box it has crossbars between the legs to give more strength it has a nonslip surface on the step and does not slide on the floor  im glad i spent the extra money and got this stool that i expect will last a lifetime
works best on clean glasses slick packaging
when i pulled this out of the box i initially was caught off guard by how old school and basic this hair dryer looks but when i used it it completely changed my opinion this hairdryer blows but in a good way it dried my hair really fast way faster than my old hairdryer its windtunnellevel airflow and the high heat setting is super hot maybe even too hot sometimes its also lightweight and easy to handle i hope this lasts for a long time
a single tablet is plenty for a cup of coffeei think these are a bit sweeter than the same size splenda tabletsthis is great for home or an office desk drawerthe cylinder container is the diameter of a us quarteri have reordered two more 1200 tablet containers  i  take them with me when i travel

this seems to be a wellformulated probiotic for women i have been taking it for about a week and i think that it has been helping me along with the other digestive enzymes pre and postbiotics that i take its hard to quantify exactly how much but it does seem to help with my digestion issues that come with post viral inflammation
the only way to buy them in bulk
ill start by saying that the pair of jade facial tools i received do indeed match the online product photos the gua sha scraper is a significantly darker shade of green than the lighter bright green hue of the accompanying roller im not sure why anyone would intentionally choose a set of paired tools that differ so drastically in color but at least theyve been accurately represented in the listingwhile the scraper is smoothly polished and comfortable to use and hold the dualended roller is rather noisy unlike most other jade rollers currently available this roller doesnt have the clear silicone plugs present inside each drilled cylinder so all rolling motions produce a clunking sound as the stones bump up against the metal bars of the triangleshaped hardware the stones are nicely polished and attractive otherwise and each end of the roller still provides adequate pressure but the overall functionality leaves a little to be desired since a silent rolling mechanism hasnt been ensuredat a current list price of 495 this is by far the cheapest jade facial set ive come across so it might be great for new users who are looking to test drive a pair of these tools before possibly selecting a slightly more expensive version but the visual impact of the widely different color shades is definitely distracting
this is a nice denture bath  good quality and comes in three pieces  the lid the inside basket and the outer bin  the lid comes off easy so its easy to access the basket  it just lifts out of the bin  i ordered the standard size and i was a little concerned it would be too small but nope  both my upper and lower dentures fit nicely
didnt work  i have a more textured curly hair type and this did nothing for me my regular flat iron does a better job at straightening and curling my ends maybe its more for naturally straight hair idk
life extension products have always been slightly over priced for the last 3233 years that i have purchased them but product works for my needs and you get what you pay for
its significantly louder than my other tool foot scrubber electric foot file callus remover hard skin remover pedicure tools for cracked heels and dead skin with 3 roller heads white by bompowon first try i thought it didnt powerup but you have to hold the power button down until it powers upi like that it comes with 3 heads to suit different issueswaterproof safe to use in the bath or shower i am shouting with happiness because this is the best ever so much better than all the manual toolsthe only negative is it doesnt come with a adapter for the wall only a usb charging cord also because it has different attachments a small cloth bag would have been wonderful to keep it all together
when i had surgery a few months ago i was unable to put my pillows over my head as id grown accustomed to doing i have a cpap machine with nose cushion mask and i used the pillows to hold that in place while blocking the light overnight but that surgery meant i couldnt use the pillows  i had to sleep on my back and propped a bit for two months so i got a night mask and have slept all the better ever since when my wife saw the difference in me she started to sleep with a mask as well  the darker night has made sleep deeper and more recuperativewe each have a mask we love the same gotten on amazon but we wanted a back up for her so she could wash that one from time to time i saw this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade and decided to give it a try ill admit  she thought i was off base with the wrap around design  it would not fit or it would be too hot or but she gave it a try she loves it1 this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade wraps around the full head i have a larger head wearing a lgxl baseball hat she does not  hers is much smaller this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade fits both of our heads comfortably2 i have not slept in this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade but i did try it on with my cpap nose cushion mask  it does not sit right i can get it closed and all the way around my head but i use it and the purpose is so as to block out all light with the cpap on there is a large gap at the base of the mask where it goes over the nose piece unlike other masks i have i cannot recommend this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade for someone with this type of cpap3 the materials are excellent this is a soft and luxurious wrap that feels cool and soft making for a very comfortable experience my wife did end up taking it off about halfway through the night feeling it heated her head too much to be fair she has the same issue with pillows but not with masks that have only the eyes covered with a strap around i had it on only for a brief time i felt i could go longer than my wife but again needing the cpap i am unable to use it4 what we both like is that there is a softening of sound with it on we use a sound machine to keep nighttime sounds drowned out but this adds to that  my wife really felt it helped her sleep a little more blocking out additional sound5 the velcro is easy onoff and it is well attached to the wrap keeping one from worrying itll detach  its secure6 looks nice for the ladies this has a nice feminine look  my wife says soas of this writing my wife loves it  as do i though it doesnt allow me to use it  and will use it often she does take it off it gets hot  but thats something that she feels is a personal thing in the end shes happy to have it and happy to recommend this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade mask
i am almost 50 and have noticed my focus and concentration on the decline i noticed a tremendous difference on the 2 dose 2 dayi was able to stay focused on a project for over 10 overs with distractioni am beginning to feel like my younger self
have no issues with them holding
the mask is soft but there was some color transfer onto my pillows  i cant explain why this happened  also the plastic adjustment clasp on the elastic band can gouge the side of my head  there must be better sleep mask options out there
wow im so happy about finding this product  i hope amazon continues to sell it  recently i had shingles and then got contact dermatitis  allergy so im trying the  free of  this one cleans as the ultra stain release original does just no fragrance tide and amazon come through again
very nice looking and seems sturdy
its a nice bunch of stuff  packed in a box for the money  it is worth  it very nice selection  of stones
these are nice for using on your face but they do not hold enough soap to clean larger parts of the body the two pads measure 3 x 25 and have soft silicone bristles that felt great on my face you squirt a little liquid soap on these and rub it on a wet face and the soap suds up nicely and cleans well the only problem is that soap can get on the other side and make the pad slippery to hold i just grasp the knob between two fingers rather than sticking my fingers in the pocket and then i can keep a pretty good gripthere is also a scrubber that has a sponge inside you can squirt soap on the sunny face then squeeze the sponge to create a fine white foam from the soap these bristles are a little bit firmer than the pads but they are still very nice feeling on the face the reverse side has thicker stiffer silicone bristles the sponge is pretty easy to squeeze and pull out of the hole it dries quickly when removed the scrubber is a nice size to easily hold and squeeze while using it is 2 inches tall by 2 inches wide
we use this to get my moms wheelchair from our kitchen into the sunroom  it works great  very sturdy
this is the best stuff for removing thermal compoundgrease much better than using rubbing alcohol
i think every household needs cleaning gloves these have the same quality as playtex they are latexfree so you dont have to worry if you have allergies there are different colors so you can color code according to task this is a great buythanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
just probably me but i didnt like smell i gave it to friend i want a real pine smell
it does seem to whiten your teeth  it is in powder form which does take a bit of getting used to  i dip my dampened tooth brush into the powder and brush my teeth  its black  so you really get all the edges cleaned getting out all the residual cleaner  it seems to be a natural alternative to chemical laden products
i held off on buying 13 cottons because i figured it couldnt be good for vaping its amazon cotton and its cheap but dont let that deter you i tried many different brands including cotton bacon prime cloud 9 wotofo cotton goose cotton etc etc this cotton keeps up with the best and has become a favorite of mine it has very little break in time lasts a long time and the flavor on it is as good as the best cottons  dont hesitate you wont be disappointed i sure wasnt
i recently scavenged a pair of these nose pieces from another pair of glasses and this order of 10 pair dshape screwon or clickon silicone nose pads 15 mm 10 pair d shape 15mm screw on was placed just after the change out  these are soft but still firm and will first be used to replace the scavenged pair and then be a reserve for future nose piece problems  i anticipate it to happen as my daughters parrots have chewed two off now  im ready for the next assault
sometimes this works against my nighttime leg cramps and sometimes it doesnt but i still like to have it on hand
really terrible product  has no power at all  waste of money
well built but dimensions are just enough off to limit use
i read tons of descriptions and reviews before i decided to give this product a try its been a while since ive had a pedicure my feet are in love the foot file did a pretty good job of removing rough skin without harm works much faster than a pumas stone i did my husbands feet and he likes a result too
pros this set contains just about every size cleaning brush you could possibly need to clean your combs razors and trimmers theyre incredibly easy to clean too cons i cannot think of anything negative to say about this kit love it
i cannot get these to work  not a good idea for me
broke faster than we could get them to work
ok these are great so far takes forever to arrive or at least feels like when cant see  light and comfortable to wear for long periods
easy to use not bad flavor at all the easier it is to use the more i can take it i have reordered i cant really tell if it works i just keep taking a variety of joint relieve products to maintain flexibility without the pain of arthritis hopefully this and all products for arthritis relief work
nearly every time ive ever purchased rubber  gloves they have either been far too big or too small  the ones in this set absolutely could not fit any betterfrom the fit in the fingers to across the palm and back of the hand to up the arm  these gloves are exactly the right size for methere are 4 pairs of gloves in this set  two sets of gloves that are unlined that feel just like a second skin  providing the ultimate in dexterity while still protecting your hands  and the other two pairs of gloves are flocked with a cotton liner making them not only easier to get on and take off but softer and providing some protection from hot dish wateron both types of gloves the tips of the fingers are reinforced giving extra durability yet still allowing for excellent dexterity and range of motion  the texture on the palm and finger pads aides in being able to grip and hold anything you are working on without any issuethe forearm protection 65  giving the ability to reach down into liquids without the liquid flooding the glove  the total length of the glove is 126these gloves are constructed from pvc polyvinyl chloride and are thus latex free making them excellent for those with a latex allergyi have really put these gloves to the test with the unlined gloves i have worked outside scrubbing metal cabinets with wire brushes and chemicals and have yet to wear through a single pair  i have used the lined gloves as ive cleaned my grill and scoured countless dirty pansthese are the best rubber gloves i have ever seen  i definitely recommend these to those looking for excellent long lasting rubber gloves to protect your hands  this is an outstanding buy
this washin helped restore the water repellency of my favorite nylon shell im not giving it 5 stars because it didnt make the shell totally repellent but maybe thats asking too much it did a very good job doesnt smell or leave a residue and doesnt appear to affect the breathability of the fabric
i am so very upset this product not only took out the ugly dark coffee stains but it ruined the beautiful shiny finish on the inside of my vintage coffee pot if you have a vintage coffee pot do not buy this it will ruin it
fits great looks nice and great price
sounds good not bose quality but good for the price battery lasts for a few nights sleep
i have problems with calloused heels and so i need to do some exfoliation from time to time  ive used the batterypowered emjoi for years but i got tired of replacing the batteries  this one is more convenient more powerful and fasterwarning  be careful  this can very easily grind too much skin off the feet and create a wound  it is best to go easy
so far so good with these capsules ive had no bad side effects and some good so that works well they seem to do wonders for the hair and skin they are said to have antibiotic type effects as well which is always a plus these are rich in antioxidants and the capsules are vegetarian since you are supposed to take one capsule twice a day this is only a one month supply so thats something to consider when deciding if you are going to start a regimen that includes this exact brand of neem seed oil supplement its a good supplement to use and seems to work so it may be worth it
here are some key points in my overall experience smell of the broccoli was stronger than the taste lol so dont be deterred by the smell lol easy way to add some veggies to your diet perfect for putting in smoothies or add to juice i love that this product is organic nongmo and no fillers i wouldve liked to know if this product is raw or cooked and also how much of the powder is one daily serving of veggies overall good experience but hoping they add the above info which i would find very valuable
used it once then tossed it did not curl my lashes
excellent flavor and i know from previous use of a different flavor that these work quite well for my upsets
great tasting way to get vitamin c
have used for years always feel scrubbed clean and easily reaches your back they never mildew or tear replace every 36 months
cleans the air in my car beautifully leaves it freah
this product works perfectly  it does exactly what it says it will do  and its an amazing price  i would recommend this to anyone  i have one for most of my rooms but plan to get two more so that all rooms have it
this is exactly as described  i was nervous it would not be the size described but it is a large size to fit any bulky or thick items for storage  very sturdy construction and the window is a plus
great to clean and sanitize wounds
would recommend these mask over all others i have purchased over the past few years i can chew gum and talk while wearing these mask with no problem
havent used it a great deal yet but i like the idea of a bug guard in lotion form  it is exactly as described  arrived promptly
these are what i was looking for and do what i needed them to do  i am happy with them
frankly we like this product it does not leak all the soap out as the 3m product did and it cleans the dishes just fine the problem is that the sponge head comes loose from the plastic base that holds it on the handle the first one came off in about a week or so and now the second one has done the same the seller is willing to send me a new set and have me return the old set but unfortunately the ups store here is not a regular store and i would need to go 90 miles to a fullservice ups store i will see what alternatives the seller and amazon offer frankly this is a bummer since the product is head and shoulders better than our previous 3m ones if only it would stay glued together
ive been on a mission to try out as many nutrition bars as i can find looking for a combination of good health good taste and reasonable cost after trying virtually all the flavors of a couple dozen different brands these came in second to   the kit bars are a bit more expensive with no subscribe and save option but are healthy tasty and not too sweetwe also like larabars and kind bars but find both too sweetthinkthin crunch have more sodium and less sugar and are soso in tastekashi bars are the cheapest at 50 apiece and the almond flax version are the least sweetmy recent least favorite are coconut simply whey bars with a fairly yucky taste
a little in my morning coffee does the trick
this package contained two household chore gloves one with the cotton lining one without a lining theyre of the large size i usually wear womens large size and these fit well they were easy to pull on and off including the one that did not have cotton lining on the inside they fit close enough and are flexible enough that i could do chores that require some dexterity the gloves cover your hand wrist and part of the lower arm im very pleased with these as i usually have trouble finding gloves that fit well are easy to get on and dont provoke my latex allergy
good price easy to use provides a deep clean for my appliances
replaced original perfect fit the only down fall is that the adjustment stem adjustment pins are not the same as original  no reason why made it work anyway
held up well even in the wind
great product and have used it for years
worked as described
this cleansing brush system is excellent first it comes with a beautiful carrying case it has a huge body brush second it has a blending brush for getting facial creams well blended into your skin which means you you less cream and it is fully absorbed third it comes with a facial brush for deep cleaning your face fourth it comes with a pumice stone as well all this plus its battery operated you really dont need to buy separate gadgets save money and be completely satisfied with this system it truly is a wonderful system and i highly recommend it i bought this with a discount but would gladly pay full price for one for my daughter in a heartbeat
i got this for my father who is advanced in age his feet ache continuously blue emu is the first foot salve that gave him relief he loves this stuff
in my opinion serves the purpose as well as 150 name brand
been using these for almost 3 weeks daily am time and i find myself having more energy for whatever im doing work walkrunningbicycling etc i like the fact that its only two tablets per dosage its also very helpful in removing a lot of water they get to retain in the body which causes bloating excess wateryou can take 2 tablets 13 times perday i find for myself since im high energy and active that 1 time per day works find out whats best for you no crash effect and you feel alert
the bulb gives light which is not as yellowish as standard soft white bulbs improving the readability of written text the bulbs themselves are very compact slightly shorter than a standand incandescent bulb turn on time is less than half a secondthe two bulbs come in a container made of thin cardboard that offers little protection both the original shipment and the replacement shipment each had a broken bulb the bulbs do contain small amounts of mercury which is toxic they probably should be  ordered separately so as to lessen the chance of them being damaged by other items in the shipment and prevent mercury contamination of the other items
barely measured out to 16 nowhere near the 17 as advertised washing element has already starting separating cheap
it seemed like it made it harder to breathe not easier  i returned
this eyelash curler was already charged but failed to get hot after 10 min of being on after trying it on my eyelashes as i pressed on it the plastic cracked i can not recommend shipping was okay
we love the original oreck carpet cleaner  we have purchased different off brand cleaners and they do not work as well as the original oreck
i just received this item and it wont even turn on such a pain to have to return do not waste your money
item was securely packaged and sealed  i use this fragrance in my diffuser to enhance lavender and orange  the smell is nice and as expected
does the job well
love these colors
i bought this squeegee for our shower tiles and glass door it works very well the angle of the handle is adjustable and an extension handle can be installed i bought a handle adapter through amazon so that a short screw on handle can be attached it came with two replacement blades and works very well makes quick work of getting the water off shower tiles and glass
this is the only form of iodine that i can take  not only that years ago i was treated for lyme disease  my heavy metals were tested and my lead and mercury were off the chart  while at an amazing clinic i was also treated with chelation therapy to reduce my heavy metals  by the time i left my lead and mercury were about 12 of what they had been but were still way too high  i came home bought an iv pkg from a local dr but they made me wait 4 months before i could start chelation therapy again  during that time i was taking 57 of these a day to help with my energy  i had read that this can remove heavy metals but how effectively  when the dr finally had time to see me 4 months later and they tested me for heavy metals they were all but gone  this stuff had pulled the rest of them out of my system  the 1000 i paid just had to be used for the occasional vitamin c iv because no one ever refunds money  now the thing about heavy metals is that they can get into every cell so you clean out the blood and other stores will be released  meaning it might take years and years to completely remove all of the heavy metals depending upon how long you had mercury in your mouth how much or how long you were exposed to other things if you are using it for anything other than as an iodine source you might want to have your heavy metals tested to check your progress  i have not had my heavy metals tested in years but this product helps to give me energy and helps me to feel good so i continue to take 35 per day  they are staples in my ever shrinking supplement list
no instructions adjustments very limited do not appear durable uncomfortable do not aid in movement
omg this scent is heavenly bought it once to test if i liked the scent buying three more now if youre buying this brand they usually have free shipping on purchases of 50 the shipping can be expensive so stocking up every few months can save you some  instead of buying one every once in a while
they were exactly what i needed for close sewing work and made all the difference in being able to see to thread the needle
works great
good for the price
next best thing to jets  easy to use and relaxing effect  when rinsing i just hang it vertically on the shower to dry
will take the matte finish off paint though walls and leave shiny spots will slowly remove the shiny surface of tiles but i think it says that on the box still a great tool for when nothing else will work
pretty good still a little chafing when im doing longer runs of 10 miles marathon coming up so i need something for the sports bra area that holds up
i used this when i had walking pneumonia i was still sick for 2 months while using this maybe it works better as a preventative instead of after you are sick
stronger than my old dollar store readers i needed new magnifiers for crafts my old ones got chewed by my puppy i decided to try stronger ones these do the trick and are stronger than what i needed like the fashionable colors i might take a pair to work and keep on my desk this is very handy to have spares i have super high powered ones that only work for jewelry inspection but not very useful the 500 is good for hand work and miniatures
great cases
my family follows a low carb diet these low carb snack bars are quite satisfying i was full for a good couple of hours after eating one they are surprisingly soft and chewable i expected them to be hard and dry but they arent i would rate the taste as in between a 3 and a 4 theyre definitely palatable ive had some bars that ive literally had to force myself to eat i found it easy to eat these youre not going to mistake them for candy or treats these would be easy to keep in your bag or take on the go
the brush is baby soft it does the job but not quite what i had hoped
i used to put a warm washcloth on my face prior to doing extractions its messy and inconvenient and the cloth is only at the right temperature for a short timei like this unit because it delivers the steam that helps open the pore prior to extraction and if that wasnt enough it even includes some extraction toolsso far so good
i bring these with me whenever i travel i recently got back from namibia and botswana cant even tell you how many times i found myself in a bathroom with no soap or in a location with no soap and sink after handling animals or about to eat a mealtheyre so easy to use just be sure that you only use one sheet per hand washing two is too many and youll be stuck trying to get all the extra soap off of your hands
after seeing this oil suggested to remove scars acne fine lines and wrinkles on pinterest i decided to by some and give it a try for myself and it actually met up to my expectations  my skin has not looked better in years
great moisturizer  i  look better already  usually cheaper on ebay though
latest update jan 2018 after 23 years of trying to keep the little feet on the scale from leaving black streaks on the bathroom floor i gave up and threw this scale away  cleaning the feet did not work coating the feet with clear nail polish worked only for a time attaching felt covers on the feet also only worked temporarily  amazing  so relieved to be rid of the bloody thingupdate i removed one star after using this scale for about a year now  the scale rests on little square rubber feet and these little bits of rubber leave black streaks on my tiled bathroom floor every single time i move the scale on the floor  its like the rubber feet are made of soot  i tried cleaning them but no amount of cleaning prevents the feet from leaving black streaks  i finally painted over the feet with clear nail polish top coat  that worked for a while but the top coat apparently wears off after a while  ive had to repaint the rubber feet after a few months  awfulthis is the best bathroom scale i have owned  ever  it is sleek in design easy to read with the bright bluelit background  most importantly it is accurate  my old scale used to give a differenr reading each time i got on it even if it was seconds apart  also this scale uses regular  batteries instead of the hardtofind led batteries the old scale used  i have only had this scale for about 2 weeks but i am really glad  i made the switch  if you are looking for an easytoread accurate scale i recommend this one
this has truly saved my life i use this twice a day to clean my eyes and eyelids and it truly has been a lifesaver i was struggling terrifically with dry eye syndrome until my doctors advice nurse suggested i try this i cant live without it
the cart is well made with long handle for easy movement i only give it 4 stars because the wheels are not tough enough for daily  city use i had to change the wheels with lawn mower replacement wheels and now nothing can stop in my everyday use why arent more being sold

its alright didnt notice anything but tingling i got this stuff the bustboosting solution and so far ive seen awesome results thought id share 
each mint is about 7mg of caffeine but it feels much more powerful than that im not sure which flavor i like more they are all very good
i have these on my amazon subscriptionwhen it comes to supplements sometimes even top brands are adulterated independent studies have shown that often what you think you are getting isnt what youre gettingamazon says these are tested and since ive had very good luck with most amazon branded products i trust them
just what i desired great smell
too hard missing the softer outer layer my chiropractor told me to buy this one but this is cheaper than the one he has its missing the outer roll totally unusable for me
i like that the straws come individually wrapped since i probably wont be drinking boba tea on a daily basis and these will end up getting thrown and knocked around in a kitchen drawer perfect size for bubble tea pearls
these gloves work really well and they are an extremely timesaving efficient means to dust both mini blinds and knickknacksthis product is a pair of gloves and i wear both at the same time one on each hand to dust a handy plus is that once one side of the gloves gets too dusty you can switch the gloves to opposite hands in order to reverse the gloves so that you are dusting with a clean side in order to continue dusting and get twice as much use out of the gloves before washing themyou can throw these gloves into the washer on cold gentle cycle but you need to air dry them i have so far washed them by hand in order to make them last longerhighly recommended
this higher dose will provide me with twice as much omega 3 than my previously used brand i am glad i was able to find this extra strength supplement im looking forward to seeing how this extra strength dosage will affect me highly recommended
i like this item because i can carry one packet or all of them  the only difficulty can be opening the packet  if your hands are stiff i would not buy this item because the handles you use to open the packet are small
i like many others was a little taken back when i opened the bottle to see that there was a baggie inside holding the vitamins that was oddthe pills themselves are banded together just like in the description so that wasnt a big deal for me i havent noticed a difference but i have had no side effects either there is no bad after taste and they are easy to swallow
its okay but dries out easy
i have read a lot about magnesium deficiency and its a real conundrum people die of heart attacks from it but most forms of magnesium cant be taken in high enough doses to quickly build magnesium levels without causing diarrhea i have experimented with taking different amounts of this product and have had no problem with abdominal cramping or diarrhea this is one of the few breakthroughs in the world of supplements
used once so far and worked well
xxl is barely large enough im 67 but even so it does physically encourage my back and shoulders toward proper alignmenti had concerns about the smell vender reached out to me and explained that it will dissipate the dissipation may take longer if its left in a colder environment such as my garage in winter

to be fair i have a very old ace bandage that i was replacing so newer ones may have already improved over the years regardless this is a nice package of 4 wraps with 2 clips each and at least 2 extra included which was a nice touch seeing as how those always tend to bendbreak at the teeth or get lost altogether the material had a good feel and a really nice stretch to it vs my older one so long as these hold up through a few uses i would definitely purchase them again if they do not hold up reasonably well ill update this review
compared to other products like this ive read many reviews and compared many products i havent fully tested and used this product yet but i have high hopes in that it will help i have a few weeks before i can really test how well this works in addition to other detox methods and changes in my diet and exercise routines i took a chance on this product and hopefully it will helpupdate 1013i wanted this product to work in fact i got the second bottle for free and took the pills for 2 weeks straight so i had really high hopes that it would work i just tested myself before my real test tomorrow and my results are positive after having not smoked for over 2 weeks and then using these pills for the last 2 weeks straight the bottle claims to work within a week and it hasnt worked for me for 2 weeks of use just disappointed that i wasted my time and money taking 6 pills a day for 2 weeks guess im going with my last resort which was an additional detox drink before my real test hopefully that will work dont bother with this if it doesnt work for me in 2 weeks i cant understand how some people got results in 1 such a let down
no complaints at all about these probiotics the potency is very good with each capsule providing 25 billion cfus the recommended dosage is 2 caps per day for a total of 50 billion cfus the strain diversity is excellent with a total of 14 strains the strains are identified but the specific concentration of each is not it also includes a small amount 5mg per capsule of a prebiotic fos to help with probiotic establishment the bottle i received in may 2021 has an expiration date of july 2022it hits the mark for both potency and strain diversity and the price for a 60 capsule bottle is quite reasonable performance has been very good for me and ive not had any stomach issues such as gas or bloating when taking them before a meal very pleased and a solid 5 stars
these are very nice essential oil rollons you get a total of 4 different blends in this little relaxation kits the tranquility  blend is a mix of vetiver cedarwood and chamomile it is a very nice woodsy aroma that smells great the piece out blend is a mi of lavender orange and bergamot probably my favorite it is a beautiful blend that is just perfect to apply before you head to bed tension is a blend that contains peppermint and wintergreen and to be honest i am not a huge fan to that one mostly because i am rather sensitive to mind ache is the last one and contains arnica and frankincense to help with inflammation bruising and sprains that one smells a bit rougher but it is supposed to help with inflammation and does seem to help maybe a little bitthat one is applied directly to the affected area while tension is applied best to the temples since it helps with headaches a little bit the other two can be applied to the temples or pulse points to distribute their effects these are easy to apply and use their scents are pretty mild and sadly do fade fairly quickly all considering i like that they come in these easy little applicator rollons that are easy to bring along really all in all nice little set that also makes for a good gift
this supplement has a lot of very good ingredients the dosage per day is two pills they dont have a horrible smell butthese are so big  i have trouble swallowing pills at all and the big ones are a struggle if they even go downi looked at the ingredients list everything is good but honestly id buy this supplement if they just put the bottom half of the list in them the top half can be had in so many multi vitamins that already exist no need to duplicate those when it is the bottom of the list id be interested in the most the subsequent pill could then be smaller as welloverall not bad but not worth it for a onemonth supply that mostly duplicates a decent multivitamin
calsules were easy to swallow and no bad taste to the capsules
works but loses shape quickly
not sure if this is working but it is plugged in next to the bed i guess it is mental the big one we got for the room works for sure
this is easy to adjust and fits pretty well it definitely helps my posture immensely they even sent a resistance band and link to exercises which was nice
i love derma nu products in general and i have used many of their items this toner is no exception to their quality products first of all it smells divine a very soft natural rose smellnot in the old fashioned sense but soft and natural it is more like a fresh blossom on the vine it is very gentle to the skin and works well to cleanse as well as tone the skin when just sprayed lightly over your skini would highly recommend this toner especially if you have dry or sensitive skin its really a perfect toner for these skin types i have used everything from high end to drug store and i have found derma nu products to be among the very best available and they are also very affordable here on amazon i hope this helps if this review is helpful to you please click yes so it can be helpful to others as well thank you so much for reading
my honeys 40th birthday is coming up and i cant wait to put this on the roller for his birthday  the images on it are vibrant and easily visible just like pictured here  its going to be great and a funny start to his day
i like keeping these in the office for those mid afternoon hunger cravings
i have reordered this and also ordered other products from this company great quality
beautiful color and sweet scented soap  i love the horse in motion that they captured in making this
nice bag for walker mother in law loves it well made
we bought these and a couple other types by far these are the best in others the inner lining was too lose after the first wash to breath easily these are very soft material but also thick enough to wear for the pandemic my son is a smaller 6 year old and its a tiny bit lose by his cheeks but otherwise fits well
i originally gave this a 3 star review because i thought it was too heavy  and i ordered a buckwheat  rice wrap  although this is heavier than the other one  the reality is that compariatively they are very close i guess when shoulders are sore they are more sensitive  i find myself reaching for this one because of the capelike design  it distributes the heat where i need it  im giving it 5 stars although if there was a 45 option id probably pick that  i wish there was a way to have the contents shift around less maybe some internal sections if that would work with also needing to shift the beads around when nuking them to distribute the heat  not sure if the physics of that but if a couple strategically placed compartments were possible that would improve this  i think the fill to internal space ratio is very good so dont add more beads i like to nap with this and dont like to nap with the buckwheat one because it is too thick and wont flatten outbelow is original for referencevery very heavy  this is much heavier than i realized even though i read the other comments  its really too heavy for me  im going to keep it as it is as advertised at least i think so i didnt think it held heat as long as they said but i only nuked it for the 1 minute  i will use it sometimes but will need to be careful with it and only use it for short period of time because of the amount of compression the weight puts on my shoulder  im using it because of an issue in an arm that is affecting shoulders and i want my lymph fluid to flow freely  i am going to need to purchase something else lighter  maybe the buckwheat filled warmer like i was originally looking for
liked this powder  it is as described  arrived on time
terrible i have size 12 feet these inserts were at least 4 sizes to small they were also paper thin spend the extra money for odoreaters or comparable
this product is amazing for cleaning the boat it gets off any pesky spots and makes getting those tough spots clean a breeze we will never use anything else
the mountain falls ultra sunscreen is a very affordable alternative to the big name brand sunscreens the first thing i noticed about this sunscreen is that the scent is pretty mild it does have the typical smell that goes along with products containing sunscreen but its not very strong at all in fact its barely noticeable when you first open the lid of it it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and doesnt leave any greasiness behind it seems to do a good job of protecting as long as you remember to reapply it regularly  every year i cringe at the prices of sunscreen out there this is a noncringe worthy comparable product
perfect for our at home tanning bed in our cleveland browns basement
my wife said it smells like 34old man34  not a great fragrance and rather strong  but good at preventing body odor
they do the trick
it makes good shakes and love the fact i can put my pills and protein powder in their too shaker is super useful good size and you can bring in it everything you need for your before and after workout the word can wash of the bottle
i am very impressed with the quality of these bags  they are at the same level as hallmark and for a much lower price  several of the bags have a 3 dimensional aspect to them  they have a nice ribbon handle and attached gift tag as well
removes all kinds of organic stains good for cradle to old age i dont mean the product is organic just that it removes non chemical stains
these are wonderful trash bags  they have a rubbery feel to them and are very stretchy  they easily fit over our standard size kitchen garbage can with no fighting necessary to get it stretched over the top rims  they dont come with wire ties and arent designed with flaps to tie so if you over fill it you really have to mash the trash down to get enough bag to tie together or buy some wire ties separately
i was really glad it was already assembled im glad i got the wood instead of the plastic it is well made and should last for a long time i thought it would take a while for my body to adjust to the positioning of the legs but to my surprise it worked just like the said it would im thinking about purchasing one for my mom the real trial will come if i have problems going im glad i got it
does the job its supposed to do good purchase  wish the handle was a little bit longer
great product no complaints
i use this to teach patients how to do self mobs and send it home with them works great wide band and string claspe
this tool works amazingly  i am a diabetic  this works perfect to remove all the dried skin that can cause infections on my feet  the speed is very appropriate  easily cleaned  speed is very consistent with it being electrical which i prefer
terrific product at a great price  large spray bottle does a great job on all my glasses including my new titanium carbon glasses  received on time and very well packages
bought this from granddaughters baby shower registry this is what i used for all my childrens laundry many years ago so glad to see its still around   its perfect for babys delicate skin is hypoallergenic
love the variety  little large but good
i have been looking for a nicer and easier alternative for a travel toothbrush and this fits the bill it comes with an extra toothbrush head which makes it even more convenient for travel when it is both my husband and myself the silver case is a nice touch too there are alternate colors available if silver isnt your thing the bristles on the toothbrush are soft and gentle on the gums all you have to do is carefully fill the toothpaste area and you are done there is a small hole in the middle of the bristles that lets the toothpaste out i appreciate that there is a cleaning stick so i can remove any residual toothpaste if i am not going to use it for awhilei did receive this product for free but my reviews are always honest
very practical
savory chicken tasted awfuland to top it off product couldnt be returned  big ripoff
there are 12 individually wrapped smal bath bombs in this set the fragrances are orange lavender frankincense rosemary mint lemongrass vanilla seasalt kiwi rose coconut and papayai tried the papaya when it was first plunged into the water see video there was fizz and no suds before i could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later see photo also the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the packagesince i personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath i used this in a foot bath the water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bathin summary these bombs perform terribly are staining and are barely fragrant in the bath the current price of 1999 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to 167 per bath bomb which is about what i would expect to pay for bombs of this size however at that price i also expect these to perform and they do not these are super lackluster and an utter disappointment i am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars i doubt the other reviewers even tried this in the bath in the box they look impressive but if they had used at least one they most likely would not be so impressed
i got some of this at an online naturalorganic foods shop and unlike every other kind of untraditional noodle i have ever cooked my husband and son both ate this and liked it i had made pasta with garlic and cheese for me and they ate my snackits good the noodles are thin and the texture is nice they taste good and they take the flavor of the sauce you use but they dont become the flavor of the sauce the way say shiritaki noodles dofour servings to a bag and when they cook up theres a lot tons of fiber in these as well 11gserving i think
overall for 11 is okaywe didnt use the adhesive that comes with it because it was obvious it was not going to work so we use normal double side tape 3mmfaster and less complicated
i like the style of kf94 masks they fit my face the best and are comfortable for me to wear all day if necessary these masks are made in china they are individually wrapped in plastic bags which i prefer i keep backup masks in my car and bag and this way i know the masks are clean until i need to use onethese masks have smaller ear loops than other kf94 masks i have used for me the smaller ear loops are good  i have a petite face and the small ear loops help me get a tight fit over my cheeks and chin if you have a larger face the small ear loops might not be a positivethe masks have the expected nose clip but above the nose clip the masks have a vshaped cutout in theory the vshaped cutout should help the top of the mask fit better against the sides of your nose since its not a straight line like most masks but for me the sides of the cutout stand away from my nose so theyre right at the bottom of my view and i worry they are a spot for air to slide in and out of the mask since they arent tight against my face
helped with recent surgery works as expected
i first learned of dmso from our teenage sons college running coach  as an athlete who runs over 100 miles a week our kid was frequently dealing with pains and injuries from his workouts  when knee or ankle pain didnt ease up after a few days and serious injury had been ruled out by orthopedists the trainers would break out the dmsosince then ive used it on my own runninginjured knee occasionally when the pain becomes too bad  after applying the area remains wet and a bit sticky for about 2030 minutes remember to wash your hands thoroughly after rubbing it in  after this amount of time you can wipe off any excess that hasnt been absorbed by your body  during this time the area usually becomes warm a bit rosy and itchy  i also get a garlic taste in my mouth which is typical for most people  for those people who use it frequently their bodies can begin to emit a garliclike odor in their sweatdmso is a byproduct of paper making and is primarily used as an industrial solvent for herbicides fungicides antibiotics and plant hormones  its had experimental use orally as treatment for certain types of cancer  at this time it does not have the approval of the fda for use on humans other than as a specific physicianprescribed treatment for bladder disordercancer  it is fda approved for use on horses and dogs and is widely used in that industryits important to note that the face and neck are more sensitive to dmso and no higher concentrations than 50 should ever be applied there  also when applying dmso to your skin its important that the skin is totally clean dry and unbroken because dmso penetrates the body  as it penetrates dmso can carry any chemical that has a molecular weight of up to 1000 units right through the skin and into the body into the blood stream and even through the bloodbrain barrier it also leaves the skin more permeable than normal for a few hours there is a possibility that chemicals such as the dye from clothing in contact with dmsotreated skin could be accidentally passed through the skin and carried directly into the bodywhile i do generally experience pain relief when i use dmso i usually save it for when my knee is at its worst
quit working after a few months waste of money
so much more comfortable than the elastic bands that hurt my ears after a lwhile
nothing special the pennant flag banner is seethrough plastic and doesnt look as nice as whats in the picture
the instructions were a bit sparse about how to set the range of motion limits but i was able to figure it out in a minute or twoi ordered a medium im size 9 mens and it was too bigits actually quite uncomfortable to walk in as the sole is very thick and my specific injury did not allow for the range of motion that would have made this comfortable
this was from the second or third batch we purchased  they work so well and are actually so comfortable weve occasionally forgotten to take them off
i bought this because i have arthritis and my tailbone hurts after a short time in any chair i was hoping for pressure relief but this is so hard my backside hurts just the same also its very large i was hoping that a pillow large enough to cover any chair would be a plus but it has hard square sides that dig into my legs and its too high i find i cant sit all the way back in the chair and dont get any back support because of the size of this pillowim glad i tried out the pillow so now i can stop thinking about buying the bed now i have to figure out how to return this because it wasnt shipped from amazon and i didnt keep the outer box
hilarious  great paper too
excellent quality mesima from an excellent company bag comes full of product and is exceptional i plan to encapsule mine or use some as tea i have not yet run out of my other bag yet so i am taking that i am taking for my brain tumor and seizures and to help slow the  process of my brain cancer or perhaps cure it but as i have the type that always comes back is like to say that im probably going to be talking this and many other medicinal mushrooms for a while thank you for all your hard work for an amazing product
last summer we had a chance to travel to asia i bought this product for my kid to use while we travel over there it worked very good it prevented the kid from mosquito bite the smell was mild
great for travel everyday use of medicationswell made easy to use
45 bought these because all of the groomers were booked up for a long time after covid closings these arrived promptly within two days they worked well on my little dog it also came with extras scissors nail file great bargain
small leaves less mess but dont do it drive you get headbox instead of razor bumps
greatest pot holder ever  love the colors available
really are they kidding us okay i had to admit that i got taken by the commercial i never get taken well hardly ever captain corcoran liked to say by these things but i also have lots of quotscuff marksquot around the house on walls doors railings etc plus oven gunk that needs to be cleaned off its that second part that really made me try this since it talked about how great this works on stove tops and ovens yeah right the quoteraserquot is a flimsy spongelike material that does nothing and unlike even the cheapest sponge it does not hold up to even the most gentle rubbing on any surface you are supposed to wet it and then rub it on the stain or dirt or gunk however if you try that even on a slick wall it falls apart in your hands its like trying to clean your cars exterior with kleenex and even if you can rub it over a surface gently and keep it in one piece it has absolutely no ability to clean none you would do better to spit on your fingers and rub them on the surface and at least your fingers dont disintegrate and you dont have to feel really stupid to have fallen for this con by quotmr cleanquot and thrown money down the drain by the way never let this go down the drain since it clogs it i used to love the mr clean commercials as a little boy and had a neighbor who looked just like the bold mascot so when id go to the supermarket with my mom i always told her she should buy dome but my mom always laughed and told me that the product itself was totally useless yes everyone always listen to your mother stay away from this money wasting useless crap
ordered these crutches for my sistershe spent over 15000 for crutches that where less quality which broke in little timeshe is walking a little easier now and more they are comfortable for her armsthanks so much for not ripping people off with higher prices
love it but wish it had a suction to stick to the shower wall
didnt keep the smell at bay for long
been using for two weeks and havent got anything to report yet will update after 30 days
gets the job done but you have to use two at once to get any meaningful coverage  i rather the company just make half and give us bigger sizes
the lemon lime sport go electrolyte powder is very high in carbs36 of them in fact for athletes marathoners and long distance bikers this is an excellent choice to rehydrate and get that extra burst of energy from carbs for the rest of us who are not into sports it works darn well when you have the flu or some other illness that depletes your hydration and energy i generally will have my hubby get me powerade gatorade or any of the other replenishing brands when i am sick not eating and having gastric issues this could literally help you through the rough times same thing when you are out in the hot sun and need to keep hydrated i am keeping this handy as one of my go tos when i am having issues
the rolls are a bit smaller than you probably would expect but the tp is just fine
i like the creamy one better than the gel one  but  dmso use has kept me knee bracesupport free every day except for extreme hiking days for the past close to 2 months
i have a medium size and love it on the plane  my husband isnt as fond of it  but then he doesnt like neck ties either  i think it beats any pillow that wraps around your neck
my daughter loves this
i had hoped for the outfit to fit more nicely then it did but its ok however not as good as it looks but fair for the price
the worst razor i have ever tried this unit would not cut peach fuzz would never buy from this outfit again
i mostly got this because i wanted to remove the fuzz from my cheap but sturdy fleece leggings and none of the attachments did the trick  it worked well on my wool sweaters though so ill keep it but its not a miracle cure for every fuzz or pill
exactly like the stuff i bought from my physical therapists office works perfectly
ordered 60 count received 30 count should have ordered straight from granite supplements
i love journaling and i am a stickler for paper feel i was hoping the pages of this nicely bound hardcover journal would have a smoother and softer feel but it is more like sketchbook or book paper with a rough and scratchy feel its just okay but not my favorite if you found this review to be helpful at all please take a moment and click the button below to let amazon know thank you so much  
theyre ok i probably wont be buying anymore they slide around and do not stay in place many many times i had to adjust the cloth in my underwear so for heavy days these would be a disaster as the mess would slide all around too the stains came out with washing though i did have to scrub and scrub right away
cheaply made within 2 days it fell off 
didnt work on my teeth just made them sensitive
i was a little concerned when i first received this as the powder alone does smell kind of funky but i found that i was able to mix it in with my coffee or tea with no discernable tastesmell i like that this contains a lot more diverse types of collagen than more normal collagen powder i like that this product is sustainably sourced and i really like that this brand takes a holistic approach to skincare that includes supplements which i feel are so important ive been using a few of their products now for a couple of weeks and feel like i am receiving the benefit of their synergistic approach
i always sleep with a mask and ive had so many different stylesbrands this is by far the most comfortable mask ive ever used its soft and lightly padded which feels good on my eyes and it has a little material that blocks out 100 of the light if its adjusted right the best thing is the little metal buckle to adjust the strap isnt right behind my ear which most masks it is and it hurts when i sleep on my side this one is pain free and perfect im tempted to order a couple more as backup for the day when i wear this one out
these are worthless they dont fly at all and barely spin when an adult tries to make it spin so theres little chance for a child to have any kind of fun with these
because of health issues i have to be very conscious of getting enough protein and this product is great to use in many ways i have concocted a frozen mixture which i keep on hand at all timesthis protein boosts the grams and also boosts the flavoring my favorite
i like this twixflavored protein  the collagen powder in this protein product really does help with the granularity but it does mean that a blender rather than a fork or spoon is your mixing tool of choice  its very smooth when made and it has a good enough flavor on its own that you wont need to supplement your supplement drink with anything but like most chocolate products a little banana or peanut butter goes a long way towards making this more of a shake and less of a drinkno matter how you like it though i think youll find its good
this scale doesnt really work properly it doesnt lock on the weight when it is done i suppose i should send it back but its not worth the shipping money in order to get a new one
they slip around on nose pad quite big
very irritating to my scalp threw away
this is the best callus remover tool i have tried so far it comes with a box of 80 sanding pads and one pad can last several uses depending on what you have going on on the bottom of your feet i tried it for the first time last night and my feet have never been softer i have used chemical callus remover i have a giant foot rasp that removes dead skin i have the manual foot sanders you name it ive tried it  but this thing beats all of them my heels are currently just as soft as my toddlers feet and im 40 years old the place where i get my pedicures done uses this tool as well but they only use it on your feet for 5 seconds slap some lotion on and theyre done i used it on thick problem areas for quite some time with dry feet and it really got it all off it will stop if you press too hard but resumes as soon as you decrease that a little anyway money well spent
a great addition to almost any bakery mix especially good combined with capella popcorn
does just what it says it does love it gonna order another one right now
lots of fun
good fit 
i had an expensive tens unit the dr prescribed via a medical supply company for years i wasnt sure how well this would measure up after that one finally gave up after years and years of use but this one is amazing and even better
these are durable for moderate use i use them for a variety of home use from cleaning to kitchen work the only time i ever have issues with them is if its my fault the sizing is perfect and what always works for me in other brands
daughter updated her room and these look great on her dresser
exactly as advertised  easy to use  works well
this is the fourth product like this that i have tried two of them did nothing one gave minimal positive results but this is amazing im into my second order and each time ive taken it it has worked as advertised i had to only give a five star rating but would like to give it a six because thats what its given mewill be buying more
i have tried many jojoba oils and this one is bar far the best  helped with discoloration on my arm  the packaging was very good and delivery was sooner than expected  have recommended this oil to my friends
eeasy to use tastes good and works great use it daily at work
i have been taking this religiously for more than a week and so far i have noticed that is may be the reason for my regularity being more reliable i cant speak towards the aiding with any weight loss as yet nor do i know what this products targeted time frame is for the price it truly does bring value towards aiding with my digestive system i would consider it an added bonus if i can shed a pound or two as well it has not caused me any new discomforts due to use so that is always a good thing no side effects for me as with all things everyones body make up is different so just because it works for some doesnt always guarantee the same results for all
ive used the pour on version of this for several years on my gas commercial type stove  this was after cleaning it by hand several times with everything else on the market and a straight razor blade to scrape off residue  then came carbon off  its miraculous  what used to take me hours now takes only minutes with some down time while it soaks  my most important hint involves use of water dont  water deactivates the chemicals so if you put it on a a wet surface or start playing with it with a wet sponge youve just stopped the cleaning power  found this the hard way  i used to have to find a restaurant supply shop to buy it but now that its available on amazon its a no brained five star all the way
this is so easy to use and great for keeping wet hair up and out of the way
these came beautifully packaged and would make a great gift send me some really  they are surprisingly large bath bombs and my bath felt really luxurious when using these  i have sensitive skin and had no issues probably the only downside was smelling great and having moisturized skin attracted some chiggers to my bare legs at the fair  lol seriously  they were jacuzzi safe no issues and i definitely plan to use more of these bath bombs in the future five stars all the way  treat yourself
i like the idea that its natural im able to stave off hunger with only 3 per day and im eating healthier
ive been taking these for a few weeks now the capsules are on the large size but easy to swallow with no odor they are vegan caps and are very cleanby that i mean that they are not full of preservatives they are made in the usa tooi see on the manufacturer page that its stated that the product is tested for quality  and i would like to see these nsf certified
works well my dad was pleased
great price perfect fit for all masks with filter inserts best tyle and materials for extra protection highly recommend
so easy and i love the catch basin that holds the remaining pill parts
this is great for those who can t bend over to put on shoes the telescopic handle is great and locks in place so it wont fold up on you until you want it to
this is the second keychain in this style i have owned i really prefer this one to my other this one is made of neoprene type fabric so it stretches better than the canvas type and puts less stress on the zipper it comes with 8 58 dram amber vials with orifice reducers and lids so you can fill them with your essential oils about 30 drops of oil fit into each bottle you can use smaller vials as well and i have found you can it a few even larger vials i have a few 012 oz amber bottles that fit in the four center slots youll want label stickers so you remember what you put in each bottle and those do not come with the keychain the pouch keeps the glass bottles safe and well protected i definitely recommend this keychain for having oils on the go
the three cuts start to tear away from each other after around 100200 swings additionally there isnt enough weight to properly keep the mat in placenext time im just going to spend the money on a larger heavier duty practice mat
smells yummy and i love the towel thank you
i really like this ill buy it again when the time comes
ok product for covering eyes kind of small though
nice nail files  they are really pretty  its kinda hard to tell which side is rough and which is fine  but they get the job done
passes the freeze test so far so good but only a blood test will tell me how it actually works stay tuned for the results
i use this product in everything from smoothies to oatmeal to pumpkin custard for extra protein i highly recommend the paleo egg white protein
i use dial soap because it does the best job of fighting odor particularly during the summer when its so hot and humid in the south  leaves me feeling clean and fresh rinses well nice fragrance  really like the mountain fresh fragrance but hard to find
they last longer them most cr123 batteries
everyone loves it i got it for my sons wheelchair everyone sees it and want to try it they all love itgrateful to get this one insurance is taking forever to get a new cushion this is very nice and affordable
works great for legs too
perfect size for travel
fairly good case sturdy seems to be put together well  needs a little more headroom above the bottles for reference books papers etc  i am always afraid my bottles will leak so do not use the handle  needs a handle to carry flat
i am a certified aromatherapist and i really enjoy exposing these companies that are selling fraudulent essential oils  first of all the price should give it away sandalwood is endangered now and in many countries you are strictly limited on harvest hence why its so priceythe smell is hideous to me it also failed the oil blot test i use to check essential oils from unknown brands  the danger in using these oils is that because they are not sandalwood you cant possible get the therapeutic benefits you would expect  many companies and now taking cheaper essential oils and combining them to smell like something else others are just using chemicals i dont know which category this falls into but it is not sandalwood essential oilwalk away
we do not have mosquitos here where i live but we do get bites from chiggers blister beetles black ants red ants gnats and spiders i am especially prone to chigger bites and  was hoping this product would help with them since the itching is almost unbearable  but it did not help at all with the chigger bites  it does however help the itching with other insect bites
i found this so hard for me to use maybe once i get use to it it is hard to get my hair into the chamber and hard to let my hair out
so far this is not working very well for me  the wrap itself appears well made is easy to put on and comfortable  the instructions are awful and it takes a bit of time to figure out how to use it  apparently the manufacturerdistributor is aware of this and sent me an email informing me if it didnt work they would replace it  so the question is what is it supposed to do  using the 34red34 setting for intensity and time and waiting for 15 minutes to warm up i could barely feel any heat only slight warmth not very therapeutic over the course of 30 minutes or so  maybe for the price thats about all one should expect  ill be shopping for a better one4118 update  after periodic use of the wrap i am changing my rating from two stars to four stars because after use i discovered the heat is adequate although it could be a little hotter  the major problem as noted by others is the control  it remains unclear how to keep the wrap in the warmest red mode and as another reviewer noted you have to keep checking to make sure it hasnt switched to cooler white or blue modes  i suspect there may be a way to eliminate this problem but with such poor documentation it is impossible so far to keep it working correctly  in summary this is a nice well made wrap that attaches to the knee well  if the cord was longer and the controls worked better this could be a very good wrap for applying heat to the knees4818 update  after continued use i am changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars  i have found that when tightly wrapped which is easy to do because of the softness flexibility and large velcro attachments using the red setting hottest it heats to a very comfortable temperature the setting controls could be improved or maybe better instructions should have been provided  this is what i am now doing  after pressing the large plastic square control button for a second or two colortemp is selected i press it when it lights red this is the hottest setting it also has two lower oneswhite and blue  after a few minutes the setting changes to a cooler white or blue color  i then repress the red and it stays at this settingtemp until i turn it off  it really works well provides a very comfortable warm pleasant temp and fits very well over the kneearea
first it caught my eyes because the price range is attractive but after use found out water leaks slowly from the side not sure if it is defect only from this particular product or in general otherwise the outlook is cute and we absolutely love it
these may work fine for you for me if i put a little too much tension on the strap attachment points they fold and release the mask
this works great guides on without tugging and the color isnt too dark i cannot find this in the store so happy to find it here
this product did not work on anything i tried it on
lets just sayit work for everything that magnesium is needed for it works especially since its in a higher dose form were already all so deficient in it might as well get a higher dose
frankly the price has kept me away from this purchase for years cant afford more than onebut put on the lamp we use the most what a wonderful difference for arthritic fingers  now we can turn lamp onoff without pain  so worth it
love this planter i put it outside and attached it to my fence with zip ties dill and potatoes are thriving even in the texas heat
this is a very nice for the  shaver that has multiple functions  the kit includes the following accessories1 rotary nose trimmer2 eyebrow trimmer  comb3 shaving head4 beard  sideburns trimmer  guard5 cleaning brushafter opening the box and reviewing the instructions i tested each of the available accessories  all work as expected  my husband tested the nose hair trimmer and said it was effective and easy on the nose  i was able to remove all of the pesky hairs on my chin using the shaver head and it was perfect  resulted in a smooth shave and no razor bumps  the eyebrow comb was easy to use and did the job  i definitely will use this when i am traveling as it is convenient and compact  this will also make a great gift for others  the heads are easy to remove  a counter clockwise twist and the accessories interchange  the unit does not come with a aa battery  only one battery is required  overall this shaver is a good buy  the shaver seems to be made of quality materials and is perfect for those annoying hairs that seem to appear as you get older
helps with a callus that i have cushion works well doesnt slip around either  easy to clean and very durable
i generally like to use my bento box and glass containers but i do like these amazon brand  solimo plastic food storage containers with lids the feel of the storage container is comparable to brand name containers the lid stays secure they are a decent size the plastic isnt bendy it can be reused a few times even though it does indicate that it is bpafree i do like to stay to a limit on reuse and the container seems durable enough for at least 5 reuses i should also add that i generally do not reheat in the container so if one reheats on a separate plate which i prefer it extends the use it is also has a pretty good price point in that it is around 90 cents per container it is worth a look if you like containers like this style
works better than any other motion sickness medication always take on cruises
these silk sleep masks are soft and stay on without being too tight i only use a sleep mask when traveling to help reduce light and to signal that i dont want to be disturbed  i find these sleep masks to effectively block out the light
i love this product it works so quickly and it does a good job of removing wrinkles from my clothing which i never iron
this set was adorable and perfect on my sister in law the jeweled safety pin for the sash was just the sprinkle on top so cute 
this thing is horrible  i can get over the fact that it didnt fit my hair dryer  i had to cut it to get it over the dryer nozzle but the dang think kept blowing off my head  i had to sit the dryer on the arm of the chair so that i could hold the bonnet on  finally i gave up and tied a walmart bag around my head and cut a whole in for the dyer  i played with this thing for over 30 minutes  since i cut it i cant return it but very disappointed
i wear these at the gun range they do ok
nice lumbar support for my computer chair
good simple designgood price
since we installed provenza oil finished floors i wanted to ensure that they were maintained the way the manufacture recommended i use this product because that is what the manufacture recommends but it is extremely pricy in my book  the product separates quite a bit and yes i know you are supposed to shake it but at times i wish i had one of those paint can shaker machines to shake the product up  i get a good workout with all the shaking required  id like to find an alternative to the product
doesnt work this product didnt help to extract any blackheads i dont know if its because my face is too oily but honestly this stuff is as effective as you doing a diy egg white mask straight up no matter if i applied one layer or 5 it seemed as if it dried around my pores and it was so liquid and drippy it was basicall elmers glue with black food coloring that is what is smelled like and that is what it felt like save your money on this one folks
my ice strap is for my back  it came with these small thin packs that look like those kids popsicles most of them after about a years use busted  leaked these are much thicker  hold their freeze point muuuuch longer great buy
used them as cake dowels as recommended by sharon zambito they are so much easier to cut than wooden ones
put out a foggy cloud of albuterol  you can see by my picture the medicine flows quickly and fine fine misti put in 2 double a batteries and it was ready to go this will be so easy to take with me when i go on vacation this handheld little machine makes me happy the big nebulizer i have is such a pain to drag out and use i will probably never use it again this comes with a usb  cord so you can plug in if you dont have batteries
this is a fun way to curl your eyelashes just be careful

i bought these on a whim and took them as directed seemed to do the trick as far as a cleanse
great product soft
i have this a one star only because it didnt catch all my sweat and i must have a weirdly shaped head because it never stayed on i do think this a good concept just didnt work for me
these were the first led lamps ive ever purchasedwe have a ceiling fan in our family room and for some reason both filament bulbs and cfls were burning out quickly within 3 months in one of the four sockets this despite the fact that we dont use the fan all that much also this particular fixture gets a lot of use in our home the lights not the fan so if i could save energy on lighting this application struck me as an opportunity to achieve the greatest payback on the investmentthese bulbs have a small footprint not much bigger than a normal incandescent lamp this was important because they had to fit inside the diffuser globes like most led lamps they send most of the light out the top in a ceiling fixture with four sockets this behavior is not at all objectionable but might be a problem with a reading lamp or other singlebulb fixturethe four bulbs draw a lot less power yet throw noticeably more light than cfls with the same lumen rating in fact im getting a lot more light from these lamps than i expected toall led lamps are currently a little pricey but these are a good deal for what they are and they have held up well so far im very happy with them as long as they continue to function they should pay for themselves in a couple of yearsupdate feb 2014  in the last 8 months ive had no problems with these led lamps burning out ive never had that level of success with either filament lamps or with cfls in this ceiling fan fixture just the fact that i dont have to get out a 6foot step ladder every two months has me very happy with this product
comfortable to wear with sandals
two layers so it passes workplace requirements
very relaxing scent  plant therapy is a quality brand
grandson loves dinosaurs and the bath bombs make bath time more fun and he gets a dinosaur prize
i have high arches but have some shoes without any sort of support and so i find slipping in a support like this can help for long term wearing of super flat shoes the appeal of these for me is that due to my high arches and the fact that these come with height adjustment padded pieces i can be sure to create a level of fit and support that is good for my feet these are cut to fit and have additional padding pieces to make for better adjustment in fit feel and support they fit well in shoes sneakers boots and do well staying in place i will consider buying these again
these are nice makeup removal pads you get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution and of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads these makeup pads are very nice and work well the removal solution is very gentle probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredientsthey smell very good and i found are gentle enough to use around the eyes i had no issues removing foundation lipsticks are eye makeup all in all i am very happy with these the price is rather reasonable too at 12 for 70 of these pads i think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant but since these are gentle enough to use around the eyes they should be good for sensitive skin
i got this to use instead of a regular bulb nasal aspirator i thought i might have more luck with a different one this worked ok not very impressed with its ability to remove mucus from my daughters nose i feel like this wasnt much more effective than wiping her nose with a tissue because it doesnt go that much beyond the nostril
it works alright if you use alot of soap without alot of soap it can drag and pull on the skin it also doesnt make alot of bubbles which can matter to some people the eye hoke makes it much easier to hold onto as when you use alot of soap it gets very slippery
used them at band rehearsal  wow the sound was clear but at a reduced volume so many plugs muffle or modulate the sound to the point where the music is not listenable so far these help to reduce the ringing in your ears they also make a long stem version making it easier to remove this version in not detectable  very discrete go ahead protect your ears
its not the same i used to use scent went from soft and baby powder to almost kind of rank or weird  i feel like this is the new coke  they changed something that wasnt broken  i wont launder anything in it except bath towels and bathmats now  very disappointed as i thought it would give clothes the soft scent that it always gave my daughters clothes  im just going to stick with tide free and clear even tho i was hoping for a little soft scented aroma therapy on pillowcases and sheets
this stuff has been very helpful to me i use it on psoriasis when nothing else helps it calms the itch i also use it on my boxer who has skin issues and ear problems since i bought this ive only had her to the vet for an allergy shot once i will definitely buy it again
this works well with shoes that are a bit larger  if you use this with a fitted shoe  the pressure is worse on the area
this is a 8 ounce bag of powdered amla amalaki they included a 1 teaspoon plastic scoop in the resealable bag and suggest 1 scoop mixed into juice or smoothies ive been using 12 tsp a day in my smoothies using a different brand for over a year this amla powder was what i was expecting in terms of what it looks and tastes like its usda certified organic vegan glutenfree  nongmo im pleased with this product
i really like the saturix 11x16 prep  spill pads as they lay on a surface very flat i have tried household basics like paper towels cotton shop towels and brown paper rolls but they all have a flaw that makes then difficult to use when i am working with products like prepping a model for a very clean mold i cannot introduce lint as i would with cotton towels i have to be aware of chemical compatibilities and paper towels usually contain clay for extra absorbancy and make dust brown paper slides on the surface and does not always help with all spills i felt like i had to choose the lesser of evils these pads are exactly what i have been looking for but simply did not know what they were called i like the  polyethylene backing which can hold up against mild solvents like isopropyl alcohol i appreciate the company also features domestic contact information on the package this is a good sign that customer service for questions and issues are more likely to be addressed i hope my experience is helpful as you kindly will click the button below
bought these as a gift but was able to try them out i think that it was weird but worth trying out
nice light scent for a relaxing bath after work
i really like this eyelash curler of course i wouldnt suggest using any eyelash curler after you have started applying mascara  i use this first and my eyes look more open and mascara added makes my eyes pop
this was for a family member he asked for more so that must mean he is happy
was so excited to receive my eyelash curler in roségold and that the gribs fo not have holes like a scissor also size looked more comfortable than the larger curlersbut so very disappointed product came in cheap plastic box that was part bend when i eagerly unpacked my product i quickly realized that the high looking quality picture does not equal reality the material looks poorhas spots like dents on supposed high polished roségold look but far more important is that the actual curling area is completely crooked lopsided as a customer i dont want to have to fix my product to be able to use it on my eyes and be satisfied with dented plastic looking like material so very disappointed in addition this curler was  8  and not the cheaper curler that one can buy in a local supercenter in person for  276 and is of much higher quality and can actually be used properly again very disappointing frustrating and waste of time and money please see my pics
so to start i understand that isnt the most conventional use for the product but it really works the first picture is the start of my shingles flareup my dad typically uses this product for joint pain but he suggested that i use this on the shingles i got it quickly from amazon and slathered a thick layer of the gel onto the painful liquid filled blisters and bumps i will admit that upon application it burns and tingles but not so bad that its unbearable after a few days the blisters started to dry out a good thing for shingles because it means its healing and after about a week of application to the area the blisters dropped considerably in size and the bumps were almost completely gone i will admit as other have that the only drawback i could see is that it is very drying i noticed that the skin around the bumps and blisters got flakey and dried out i wanted this product to dry the blisters so just be wary if youre using it for pain relief etc
this did things to an old rug i thought not remotely possible  including not animal related spots  i extremely highly recommend
this weighted pencil holder is not a bad product the grip on it is large so if your kid is more comfortable with a bigger pencil to grip its got that covered the outer portion isnt squishy its sort of a sandy grip which isnt a bad thing either the trouble is that you need to attach this using a tiny allen wrench to tension the grip onto the pencil which means that you have to have the wrench out every time the pencil needs sharpening my boys mash their pencils into the paper resulting in many broken pencil tips the allen wrench never gets put away greatly increasing the likelihood that itll be lost there has to be a better way to make this grip adhere to the pencil but other than that its a great device for helping kids that need this kind of aidbe advisedthis listing was not for the kit i only purchase as per the listing the delux grip third from the top its a bit pricey for what you get and ive found a better option so you might want to see if you can find this locally so you can have a look at it before you buy
this product helped me to have bowel movements without my stomach cramping up
only bug spray we will use keeps the bugs off us in the deep woods
love these containerswill buy them again for sure
im a big shopper of silly cheap gadgets and this seemed too good to be true but i gotta say it works made wiping down and cleaning my microwave much easier after using it  would suggest for anyone whos like me and forgets to clean the microwave often and finds an inch thick worth of gunk to clean off
i use this so i can hear my iphone ring over all the equipment running in my shop works great can be turned up to a very loud ear piercing setting just what i needed

wow i like the colors and quality is good 
no complaints about the formulation of this probiotic it hits the mark for both potency 25 billion cfus and strain diversity total of 10 strains 8 lactobacillus and 2 bifidobacterium stains the specific strains are listed on the bottle but not the specific concentration of eachit delivers the 25 billion cfus with a serving size of only 1 capsule 2 caps are the more common situation making this bottle of 30 caps a months supplythe downside is the price there are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same or sometimes better potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a months supplywhile the formulation is solid the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars average equally good options are available that are a much better value
this was useful when i had it gave me an effective way of straigtening my hair without burning my skin off lol heheh anyway now i just dont have as much of a problem with my hair being curly so i dont need this as much but i keep it in case i need to straighten my hair for an event or occasion bcs i dont want to go back to normal straighteners so glad this exists
they are comfortable and fit well and good price

the herbal infusions strength killed any odor on the pad also the remedy gave a cooling sensation i would love to exclusively use this brand
makes granite looks good and very smooth after cleaning
great product
i got these for my wife who said they cut like butter no jagged edges they cut smoothly and you barely have to press down on the lever youll never buy the cheapo cvs walmart ones againspending this much on nail clippers you would be crazy not to i dont think we got fake ones this is a high quality machine im already ordering the bigger one
not bad but i think being that my foot is small it rides up so i find myself pulling it down but when i do that it doesnt cover my fore toe but i will continue to use it because i need to see if it works better its only been 1 day so i will update later
i have trouble sleeping and magnesium seems to help this package of individually packaged doses makes it easy to consume magnesium in a liquid versus tablet or capsule form it has the potential to be more potent as it gets into your bloodstream more quickly i also like the taste a bit sweetwhile i appreciate the convenience of having each dose premeasured for me the doses come in these small plastic vials to get out the entire liquid i found myself biting down on the plastic vial itself as if it were candy and indeed these vials remind me of the candy soda pop vials that kids swilled by biting off the wax top and then drinking the sugary liquid inside its kind of wasteful but i cant deny theyre convenientgreat for travel but not great for the environment
i have about 4 different kinds of medicine and this is perfect before i bought this i would dig through my purse looking for different bottles but now i just look for my little grey box and everything is right there it has never come open on its own which is also a plus
great workout capris  there are a little thicker than expected and the material dries a little slower than other pairs i have in different brands but great for running  easy to move in these capris breathable material  there is a lot of stretch to these  if anyone is trying to figure out there proper size i am 51034 162 lbs waist 3234 hip 3934
you would think every pain relief cream is the same  i guess that is what i thought but i was wrong  in the beginning i would use bengay  you can get it at every store and it works  i like the smell of pain relief creams  the mentholy smell actually is relaxing in itself for me  bengay works for us  but then at the chiropractor i started using biofreeze  i guess i should back up a littlemy husband has scoliosis so his back always hurts  personally i have a neck injury including a spur a mid back injury from a car wreck so i have a lot of scar tissue under my shoulder blades  i have also just been diagnosed with arthritis in my foot  i probably have it in my knees and elsewhere going to a rhuemy in a few weeks  anywayi guess what i am trying to say we have pain  we are both pretty active dont like to take a lot of meds but like most do not like pain  who doesso biofreeze i like biofreeze you can get it in a big pump bottle  it is more of a gel and spreads okay it just seems like i have to use a lot  icyhot i had to buy that we were running out of biofreeze and the store didnt have bengay  icyhot is okay  it is hard to spread and it seems like you have to use a lot of productnow reliefor  i honestly like it  i had a chance to try it for a discount in exchange for an honest review  i am glad i did  i like the consistency  it is not a lotion not a gel  it is a light blue liquid cream and spreads so nicely  i used it on my husbands back and it it spreads around so easy  he said it didnt feel as hot34 as others he has tried but i had also just given him an alcoholic beverage and he was feeling pretty relaxed   mei tried it on my neck and shoulder knee and foot  i like it  it brought relief  it brought warmth  it was easy to put on and absorbed well and is non greasyi would like to look and see if they carry bigger sizes  i would buy this again  it is probably my favorite out of all the creams i have tried  really  so i recommend trying it and seeing for yourself
loved the product just dont think i will order that particular size again too big  the adhesion is fantasticmuch better than what came with the unit
husband likes these because the bristles are pretty stiff he likes a nice firm back scrubber  they seem to hold up  i will update should new info seem useful
feels nice and blocks the light fits a little close to the eyeballs  but i am using nightly and i like it
i bought this to try on nerve pain particularly sciatic nerve pain it has a nice creamy moisturizing feel and is easily blendedabsorbed by the skin not a bad product but in this application for this person it is not working to soothe the pain weve used it over several weeks and it isnt dulling the nerve pain as well as a soaking bath with magnesium salts does in this case tried it for muscular pain and it seems to do ok for the price for our needs i would buy magnesium salts and soak in the tub instead great shippingfulfillment of the order seller is great
thick and comfortable when they come out of the package  i use mine in a medical boot because it is so hot and the inserts are flat with no cushion and i doubled up after 2 days
just like going to the hygienist 
im very happy with this spray cleaner  it smells great and not sticky  i would try other 34flavors34 when i run out of peppermint
excellent product give me a great workout have no regrets
for the price its good  one thing though  depending where i moved it on the kitchen floor or bathroom floor it was off consistently by 2 pounds up or down  which means its the floor not the scale  for example it would say 128 or 130 but nothing in between and not all over the place when i was weighed at the doctor office it was consistent
im never disappointed by this brand which makes great gua sha stones this pink rose quartz is well packaged and the stone is smooth and polished its great for using against your skin and a number of youtube videos show you how to do it its a nofrills package but the quality of the stone makes up for it
never seen a product dispense medicine like this turn knob and medicine comes out besides that it works  i use it for back pain and on the soles of my feet for neuropathy
these did help somewhat for dry eye but not enough for the price
along with the fact that these are wonderful at keeping the bloating away they capsule size is also medium so they are easy to swallow  some capsules are so huge i cannot take them but these are average size  great product
my bottle arrived without a lid pretty unhappy about that because now i cant carry it with me in my bag due to it possible getting the spray nozzle knocked off or broke or causing it to leak the product works but i dont understand how it could be shipped just thrown into a bubble mailer with no lid and nothing to keep it from leaking
doesnt smell like lemon essential oil at all to me smells very fake i think i should have been wary to buy such a large bottle for such an inexpensive price
i love the product and wish i could buy more
i didnt know how much dead skin i had until i used it so much dead skin came out and easily after a few minutes it was like i have new feeti didnt try the nail part completely yet but i did polish the nails and they came out great this is a great buy
accurate and idiotproof  wed been trying to be able to weigh my quadriplegic husbandshort of taking him and his wheelchair to our veterinarian and weighing him on their scaleand this is the perfect and simple solution

vegetable glycerin used in food applications is usp grade or over 99 pure and has a sweet taste vegetable glycerin metabolizes differently than sugar and is used in low carbohydrate foods for sweetness and moisture unlike sugar glycerin does not contribute to tooth decaymany household products including lotions shampoo and toothpaste contain vegetable glycerin glycerin is added to these products because it is a humectant a substance that attracts moisture to the skin in the cosmetic world this has two practical applications first glycerin leaves your skin hydrated glycerin soap for example is popular for that very reason second for cosmetic products that deliver an active ingredient a humectant can increase the solubility of the active ingredient making it more easily absorbed by the skini personally use this glycerin to make my own soap i love iti also love the price i will be buying again and again
i heard of sea moss awhile ago and been searching for them in supermarket but no luck at all therefore i turned to amazon and surprisingly this particular brand has many 5 star reviews so i went ahead and bought thisit look genuine and promising from the packaging upon opening the bag i found bits and pieces of things that were confusing at first that was only a tiny bit of the sea moss i took out from the bagi did a little research and read all of the question and answers on the amazon page regarding this product the seller mentioned that this sea moss originate from indonesia previous edited from philippinesthe colorful threads and strings are plastic it is not surprising at all if these sea moss were farmed near textile factories these very thin plastic threads are made from melting of plastic and making them into fine threads and then into clothing the finer transparent plastic threads clings to the sea moss for their life it is almost impossible to get rid of every single piece you will see what i mean if you soak italso on the packaging itself located on the back states  34cal prop 65 warning34 this product contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harmthis indication is not pointing to sea moss causing cancer but the substance that is in the sea moss that comes from waste and heavily polluted areas i have am pointing out what is clearly stated i love sea moss but this particular brand contains dangerous chemicals that causes cancer it horrifies me even further because indonesia is no where near safe from the fukushima spill all of the area of the pacific ocean contain high level of radiation due to the spill sea plants are highly sensitive and will absorb these radiation thats why sea food from the pacific ocean are much cheaper compare to the atlanticas always do your research and watch out better safe than sorry
i love the fresh air smell
wonderful blocking mats thicker than usual and very sturdy  should last me many years  im very satisfied  they got here super fast too
i bought several of these to have our crew test them out and they are indeed the genuine article for a few dollars less than our regular supplier plus they come in a nice case once opened and unfurled i couldnt tell them apart from our first batch of authentic bandages  they are well manufactured and work exactly as they should in our numerous drills  when we need more for our trauma  first aid kits well be sure to stock these
i was surprised how well this cleaned  removed grease  from places i had trouble with before would love if it was a little larger still works wonders if you add a bit of cleaner or viviparous to sponge  if you have reactions to cleanser because of odor or chemicals this is a must have
i use this for keeping dust out of my nose when i change the catbox ive no idea how effective it is on a scientific level but it decreases the irritation a lot i preferred this to disposable masks since i have enough trash as it is
whats better than a piña colada a piña colada the packs a powerful protein punch i definitely give this drink mix five stars for flavor it doesnt taste at all like traditional whey protein powder it seriously does just taste like youre drinking a piña colada blend  it with some ice and coconut milk and you are good to go before ordering it i scoured the product information page but i couldnt find a list of ingredients listing the sweetener i am fairly particular about what sweeteners i use but decided to take a chance since i love piña colada even though i didnt see where the sweetener was listed i was disappointed when it arrived and saw that uses sucralose which tends to make me feel sick i will probably not be finishing this due to that fact despite the delicious flavor the ingredients list on the amazon page literally just says whey protein isolate this should definitely be updated so that people can make an informed decision about what theyre putting into their bodies if you dont mind sucralose this is a delicious protein powder for sure
great for travel
fits ok it feels a little big for me but to use it in the house i have no issues the shoes come with a shoelace that can be adjusted with a cord lock and that help with the size issue the battery its very easy to place the battery inside the shoe pocket and secured it with the zipper its comfortable yes a bit but still have the feeling the shoe is a little bit big for me how about the heat the heat did not felt that strong just enough to warm your feet i guess thats a good thing to avoid sweat in this type of shoe the material looks ok but is not waterproof at all thats what i mention about interior shoes the shoe feel soft in the inside and kinda wabbly in the back of the shoes in general i like this shoes to chill in the house but i wish the heat was a bit stronger
this is the best of the critter chasers i have tried here easier to install and seem to be louder extra star come with documentation for maintenance and battery replacement waiting to see how long the rechargeable batteries last this is my second purchase of this set
these must have come from a bad batch i bought these to replacer previously purchased refills that werent working the spray is coming out of the bottom of the head of the spray can and filling up the holder not spraying out into the air this is a manufacturing issue and poor quality control
feels very supporting on my foot
love these socksthey really work good  i ware them doing the day around the house
have tried several arch support brands  this one seems to be the only one that actually provides 4cm stablizing reinforcement to my high arches  have reoccuring plantar faciatis  these help stabilize my arches to help reduce pain  formed plastic eva doesnt deform when standingwalking to provide consistent support
product as stated
when my baby is congested i rub this on her feet and the next morning she is all better
doesnt clean try ounces ounces then the rest of bottle
very cumbersome to use didnt see any difference in curl a manual crimping curler works far better not sure why i was asked drying power and flavor 
i have a quip toothbrush that i have used for travel for the last couple of years  i dont think it cleans that well it only has one speed but you can replace the battery easily  this sonic toothbrush will replace it completely  the hieie has 5 different modes and 3 speeds claims to run 30 days on one charge has a nice carrying case and really cleans my teeth  i can tell a big difference when i use it from my oralb toothbrush gums feel like they have been worked over and the teeth feel cleaner  cant wait for my next dentist appointment to see if it really helps as much as it feels like it doesone star off easy of use for no instructions in the package and that the charging base doesnt fit in the travel case  note that the charging base is tiny very easy to place  doesnt come with usb charging block does come with the usb cable  since everyone has too many usb charging blocks i dont see that as a negative
bulky and too thick
capella flavor drops gingerbread concentratefor  a flavoring it taste soso  has a slightly artificial under taste  nice smell i added to my coffee and food it sort of tastes like it has ginger in it but only semiconvincing weak flavor  not terrible but not good  bitter is not the problem  ginger tends to be a little bitter but the flavor is not balanced properly  will finish bottle because it not its awful but will not buy again
its ok i use it for my injuries in the shower i need something a little more rough this is nice to keep your skin soft with daily use i rinse off with cold water to prevent a rash but using anything with friction on the skin can cause irritation
i guess the only product i have in my history of teeth whitening is crest strips these do not truly compare to them these did not cling as well to my teeth as the crestdo i had to keep readjusting to assure they would stay in place as far as actual whitening i did see a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth the big plus here is that these are about 12 the price of crest so if you are looking to save some money these might be great for you
i love the premise of this vitamins to help you feel good during practice and contribute to keeping you fit and limber this line has such a wonderful array of products and this is no exception ive only been taking them for a few days but so far i like them a lot and recommend giving them a try
this is an okay straightener and curler i personally did not find it better than the one i have been using i think my granddaughter took it home with her and she has been using it just fine she has a thick head of hair but the strands are fine like mine so it is easy to work with our hair
actually daughter loves it
there are red lights around the entire inside of the collar and an infrared heat coil over the spine in the back segment of the collar its easy to open and slide around your neck which i tend to do from the front or side then rotate the collar into place and then shortpress the power button on the front outside of the collar to start it you can longpress to stop it at any time or shortpress to cycle through 3 heats levels the red lights appear to have only one intensity yes i wouldnt want them to dim even the lowest heat 1 is pretty toasty and im a gal who normally runs infrared as hot as it goes after about a minute its too hot to press directly against my neck but the collar design allows me to shift it slightly back and itll stay that way overall im pleased most red light devices dont allow good coverage of the neck but this one does
this is one time i should have paid attention to other buyers reviews  this is very unstable and words dont begin to describe how hard it was to put together  sadly since this was made in china the cost was too high because we all know that the product cost very little for the company to have made and the markup to the consumer is a sin
product description was wrong it said it was compatible with my brush but they werent
i loved how this made my skin feel after using no unexpected reactions from my sensitive skin
these were a literal life savor for my wedding when i was breaking them in beforehand my heels kept popping up if i wasnt careful but the day of i stuck these in and they where comfortable and kept my feet from popping out the entire night this also involved me hiking all over gardens and climbing hills and rocky paths i never once was concerned about losing a shoe and falling to my death if you need that little something to keep your heels in place get these they are perfect
i bought these for my husband he wears a mask as work and it was hurting his ears these did the trick he said its just what he needed
i like the mixture of ingredients incorporated into this product the dose for one capsule seems rather low so i have been taking two i tend to have a sensitive stomach when it comes to taking pills this formulation does not bother my stomach at all seems to be very gentle which helps in compliance in taking these every day i normally take a shot of acv in a glass of water and this is actually so much better the other ingredients are great additions to help boost the affect of acv i seem to be in more control of my appetite lately and i think that regular use of these pills have contributed to that even so taking acv every day is beneficial to health
just what i was looking for  the curling iron has several settings to control heat and time  it is easy to use and the curls last
checked out on the tester as fully charged
our chiropractor sells these pillows at her office and had encouraged me to try one after i was treated for neck pain resulting from a whiplash injury  this was over 10 years ago and its the only pillow i will use  i usually buy a 3 pack and replace my pillows in less than 2 years so this is an economical way to buy them  when i purchased my first 3 pack i had my husband try one and he liked it as well
one end is same as a people brush the other end is smaller but not thinner i use the small end  switched to my finger
these are delicious and so flavorful  i was expecting a vinegary hot sauce taste these are not like that at all they are great for dipping or adding flavor to anything
exactly what i asked for in a timely manner
these hair trimmers cut my hair very efficiently they gave my hair a smooth and even trim the motor proved very powerful and did not slow down at all with a great battery life and very sharp blades they surprisingly did not irritate my skin these professional trimmers are much better than most any that i have ever used they are a precision instrument and were well engineered great design and even better followthrough
good product but on silver jewelry use with caution  i suggest testing a small area first  dont leave silver jewelry immersed longer than a couple of seconds  love it for sterling silver chains  quickly dip in and out  i always rinse jewelry in water after dipping
i had to have a handyman help me put this in the trap underneath the kitchen sink i did notice that the sink drained faster and with less issues after having used the tablet  it was less convenient than using a powder version but it did work
its a little stiff
one of the best protein flavors i had the other ones are better but this one is still pretty good
this is a really nice unit for back pain  i was in a car accident a few years ago  ive bought tons of back braces over the years massage tools and other items to help back pain  id definitely put this in the top three of the items that have provided pain reliefits very easy to use  set the base up put the device on top of it  then just turn it on  i let it go on automatic mode and was happy with that  my wife like the heat too  said it felt really goodwe are very happy with this overall
this case is super attractive and holds a total 27 of my vitamin e 2000 iu capsules if i could remove the insert it would hold a few moreloves love the the design and that there is a different embossing on the top and bottom so i can tell which end is up love that it is small enough to be portable the clasp is super sturdy so it will not come undone in my pursedislikes i wish the insert were removablein summary this case is really sturdy and super attractive it will only hold a few horsesized pills but it is great for those who have smaller pills to carry also the clasp is very sturdy  the current price of 999 is competitive for this
i have been suffering a couple months with heel pain from plantar fasciitis  i thought id give these a try and wow i was surprised at how much they cut down on the pain  i wish they came in a tighter and thicker version
i like these well packaged as well
not as good as some of the others
it says no fish burps but ive been burping fish starting 30 minutes after i took it  i wont buy these again because their claims are just not true
this was a gift for my boyfriend and i was pleasantly surprised by the quality its super convenient for both home use and travel he mainly keeps it on his desk since thats usually where he is when its time to take his medication then when we go away he just throws it in a backpack or toiletry bag it takes up less space and looks nicer than those orange pharmacy bottles and he never has to wonder if the lid is on correctly either a small button on the front pops the lid right open and pressing it back into place automatically closes it securelythe interior is divided into two compartments they might be a bit small for extended trips but a single side can hold enough of his prescription to last several weeks so he generally uses the second side for something else when we travel the amount of pills this box holds obviously depends on their size but all of the medications we have at home fit well including large otc capsules and vitaminsoverall this pillbox seems wellmade and durable it has a nice weight to it and its easy to clean the image on top looks exactly as pictured except for a couple scuffs on the bottom its still in great condition and perfect working order after several months of consistent use my boyfriend isnt exactly careful with it so id say its held up splendidly i think it was well worth the price
scratched the heck out of me
first container contained black small particlesa like it was previously opened
these bars are amazing  low sugar  high protein  probiotics make you so full  sometimes i cant get through whole bar kids love this flavor too like this one better than almond one hard to find in stores  wish they sold them more places please carry through whole foods
good product  shipped quickly  thank you
this is just a flat iron with teeth  if you roll it on your hair it pulls and burns the hair that gets stuck  i do not recommend  its a waste of money  i am asking for my money back
moved a lot and did not feel helpful
using hemp products is a bit of a crap shoot because youre never quite sure if the product is going to have any effect on your condition  so im giving a cautious thumbs up for this because ive been using it with great success on an inflamed muscle in my leg  i didnt expect it to work this well i tried it because when i test a product i put it through all sorts of paceswhat i found was that within about 5 minutes of application the pain in my leg and backside had eased considerably  it didnt go away entirely that required the addition of some nsaids but it did make the discomfort manageable which is a blessing  when i tried this as a sleep aid it did nothing for me  results on a headache were mixed  i will say that some advice i was given  always look for hemp products that are co2 extracted  was good advice because i find such products to be acrosstheboards more effective than any otherswhat can i take away from these experiments mostly what i take from most such experiments we are all different and products like this which are created without set standards will inevitably vary so if this works for you for some conditions be glad use it you lucked out  if it doesnt hand it off to someone else who might have better luck and try something else
i love this product and its great for so many ailments its definitely an acquired taste and its not particularly cheap but i think every household should have it in their medicine cabinet
these bags are very strong and easy to see through im using them to move and store belongings they are easy to get off the roll i bought another box to have on hand
not sure yet because i just put them on
i have ms and am recovering from a multiply broken back  i think i can honestly doubt i would have survived even this well without these to get me through the day when i have to be in a car at home in bed after therapy and sitting for a few minutes in the sun for vitamin d
came on time very useful in keeping counter top clean nice to have everything that goes in the dishwasher
i believe turmeric is so good for your overall health these capsules include gingers which are also great
read many reviews all glowing and not one with my problem  while putting it on the top gasket the one with the hole consistently popped out of the blue ring  rats i was so looking forward to a first shower in nearly a week  im sure my wife was too  solution  easy i made sure boot gasket was properly seated on the lower ring an put a band of surgical cloth tape over the boot gasket  the carefully placed the top gasket centering it and press the top ring down all around now the gasket will not slip out and youre ready for your shower
great stuff works awesome on all baby kid and adult stains formula spit up baby food and leaky diapers works better than any other stain remover ive tried
very strong energy from this amazing
leave this product in your shower while the water is still running pour the oil onto your body and rub it in also pour some oil under your running bath water this is my absolute go to oil
really tasty and high quality product  highly recommend
i have been taking these daily for a month now and am pleased with the results good quality vitamin d3 at a fair price
needs reheating  kind of too chewy but delish to keep in emergency
arrived with one candle broken so returned the whole thing do not know about the longevity  it doesnt smell that great unlit but not sure if it would smell better once you light it
i used it for cleaning and it smells great and last long and cleans good
these are great and well made the material is sisal so its a little scratchy but considering youre using it to get clean its a plus similar to a loofa the bags hold up in the washer too i throw them in with my towels
works bit the lock for mouth piece jet doesnt snap well
totally happy with it met my needs and expectations
poor cleaner does not make me feel like the mat is clean after wiping down smells nice though
these are very nicely padded if you are like me and have a skinny arm then they are loose and do slip down but i prefer this to the really tight fit that cuts off circulation i have washed once to check durability air dry only and they are in great condition i am happy enough and would buy again
for the most part the unit functions well  however the instructions are written in what appear to be 00000000000000001 font size  in addition the writer obviously spoke very poor english and the instructions were not meant for this unit  not sure what moron thought this was a good idea but they have no business writing an instruction manual
i was quite surprised when i made my first smoothie using the smoothie blender bombs absolutely delicious very filling  for half the day definitely would buy again i purchased the peanut butter chocolate yummy
needed this for my 32 oz bottle of hibiclens
i have used kt tape and rock tape both are excellent but expensive i tried this brand but not again  i must be allergic to the adhesive it has torn my ankle up very itchy and irritated swollen and welts not happy
did not work at all a waste of money really i left it in a heel that annoyed me in one area to try and stretch it out and i had it there for days it did nothing
just what we needed
this goat milk bath was so luxurious i purchase the 2 piece sampler and used the lavendar  rose it doesnt have overwhelming aroma if youre concerned about clashing with your perfume my skin gets dried out in the winter and this soak made my skin so soft and moisturized afterwards that i didnt even have to apply lotion the product dissolves completely and the bath water turns milky which i think gives you the total spa experience love the five sisters products and look forward to trying any new items they might bring out
price is a little high
i appreciate that this noni fruit powder is certified organic and nongmo it appears that the only ingredient is the noni fruit the powder does not have a strong taste but i usually use it in a green drink or fruit smoothie it stirs in fine they include a small plastic 2 g serving scoop about a teaspoon in this 8 ounce sized package there are about 114 scoops so the powder will last for a while seems to be a good quality product
i suffered severe chronic constipation for 8 years going from dr to dr was diagnosed with lazy bowel disease and tried everything imaginable to find relief but found no cure after having read about it from this linkand tried it i have not been constipated since it took about a week of gradually increasing the dosage to take full effect but to me using this supplement has been like a medical miracle and i am very grateful lt3
i have sprayed my patio every day and the stray cat still comes and lays on it waiting for birds at my bird feeder  waste of money
i think this container of collagen is kind of pricey coming in at 3998 as of this review  ive reviewed other high quality collagens that cost less and were also flavorless  that said i think this is a good collagen product for collagens i and iii  it dissolves well in liquids and has no taste that i can detect  ive been taking collagen on a daily basis for about 8 months and have finally started to notice improvement in the skin on my arms and face  it takes a long time to see results so consistency is needed  my skin is a lot more flexible and plumper
feels flimsy and im afraid every time i step down on it
this is my favorite goto wild rice mixone time i couldnt find this brand in stock so i got the rice select rice blend instead  big mistake and big disappointment as the first ingredient in the rice select blend was texmati white rice
i do not know if has helped my joints or anything else people claim but it maintains my cholesterol better than the fish pills
these are really soft and easy to insert  much better than others ive used  at this price just buy em  
im a really big fan of rez block essentially what happens is that when rez block is added to water the water is then able to trap a lot of the resin that would normally accumulate in the piece of glassware or end up in our lungsyou will want to change your water more frequently with rez block as it fairly quickly shows just how much gunk it is stopping
the girl loves bath bombs and is usually the only one who gets them this set i had her mom take with her and they get to share them they love them it is so nice to give a gift that someone absolutely loves

loved these i searched everywhere for birthday decorations that were fun and modern and i bought several things from ling s everything arrived in great condition and quality i would definitely use this manufacturer again
im a protein powder nut i start off every day with a protein shake and i love trying new flavors and combinations of flavors to keep it from getting boring of all the proteins ive tried recently this and the oatmeal cookie version from the same brand have been some of my favorites flavor wise oh my word yum i thought it would be like nutela but it actually has a bit of a nutty flavor along with the chocolate which i really enjoyed i seriously love the taste it mixes smoothly and isnt gritty at all my only complaint is that its sweetened with sucralose id prefer something a little more natural like stevia or monk fruit but other than that its fantastic
bounty is about as good for a fraction of the price
this device is awesome it has allowed me to have mobility after footankle surgery it can also be easily moved out of the way for another driver to use the car normallyby the way i did not purchase it here i rented it directly from the seller which is a great option for those that only need it short term
this has a great flavor works well
too hot and being tied to the usb insane
works well for massaging lotion or whatever cream you want to use i find the roller isnt as easy or feel as comfortable while using it
this thermometer does not work took temperature today and it read 346 dont think that is right at sll
i have this coffee recommended by anthony williams and i want to share this with my mom and she she loves it and i have reordered this chicory coffee 3 times already and she cant get enough
these are wellmade mop heads the microfiber center had zero loose or puckered threads and the density of the microfiber was nicely dense for good pickup performance the fringe around the edge is stitched on well and also did not have any loose or pulled threads they fit and work well with many platform mops provided that the mop has velcro on the underside of the platform to grip the padthese work very well when dry mopping the microfiber picks up and holds an impressive amount of dust pet hair and other similar gunk the fringe around the edge makes it easy to clean right up to the baseboard or if used in the kitchen at the cabinet toe kick area it also helps ensure that the mop doesnt mar any chair legs or furniture if it gets bumped while moppingthe performance is not as good as a wet mop due to the fringe thats not a problem specific to these pads but occurs with any pad that has an outer fringe its certainly useable and effective as a wet mop but a nonfringe mop head usually performs betterthe set comes incased in a sealed plastic pouch which keeps them nice and clean during transit and can also be used to keep them clean in storagea very good mop head  five stars
fits my water furnace series 7 perfectly the merv 11 is great for the area i live in
this is a fantastic ice roller it is just heavy enough to have a terrific feel in your hand the weigh allows it to roll freely smoothly across whatever body part you are working it on it stays cold long enough to do its magic and its just plain wonderful that it came with a case storing it in the freezer is a breeze compared to other rollers that i have the case makes all the difference in the world the curve of the handle and the weight of the roller actually even made it a great roller for a back massage i highly recommend this little device
excellent product  i feel the benefits

coconut oil is often a solid at room temperature except during the hot months so i was glad to see this oil available for review  our house is kind of cold and it has remained a nice clear and easy to use liquid  its easy to pump out and apply  i cant say its the best moisturizer ive ever used because coconut oil is naturally a little dehydrating  i still like it though and have been using this oil everyday after showering  it does not smell like coconuts at all and has no scent that i can detect
this thing destroyed a pair of pants it also pulled places and added more pilling on a sweater
my husband is a diabetic and he has a lot of nerve pain in his feet because of this i purchased this for him to try because it is 100 pure natural and herbal he has been taking 2 capsules a day for a while now and he is starting to notice less burning and tingling in his feet  this is allowing him to finally get a full nights sleep before he was up walking the floor in pain for hours  hopefully with continued use his feet pain will go away all together i  received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review
my 11 year old daughter got this bath bomb in her christmas stocking and she loved it she has used other bath bombs in the past and they were a bit of a let down so we werent expecting much we were pleasantly surprised it dissolved great not too quickly with lots of fizz and the color was a vibrant teal blue just like in the pic but the best part of this bath bomb is the fragrance its called flower bomb and its described as smelling like primrose i was dreading the smell because the scent of artificial floral beauty products is usually pretty awful in my opinion this bomb smelled so pretty not too strong or overly sweet im super picky about smells and i loved it id definitely buy this particular bomb again and its likely that id try others made by da bomb oh and it came with the little flower eraser shown in the pic so cute
i loved this lip balm when i first started using it  after daily use for two months im having a terrible reaction  the lip balm causes irritation dry throbbing and cracking lips  there is also truth to the mold issue for this product  do your research  i have an unopened 5 pack that i plan to return asap  do yourself a favor and dont use im not sure how long it will take the negative affects to go away but ive thrown all of my used items away
they hold up well
i purchased this for my dad who has cancer and has issues standing in the shower this seat fits his tub perfectly and has different levels the seat can sit so it can go higher or lower depending on preference it has a soap holder too which is nice and a mesh bag its a must have for elderly or disabled people it makes showering much easier because you can sit instead of standing
these glasses are great overall with one painful exception the nose pads  the pads themselves are the thinnest ive ever seen on glasses and provide very little cushioning  to add to this flaw the pad arms arent able to support even the weight of the glasses and are always bending  when the arms and pads are properly positioned which is rare these glasses feel uncomfortable on your nose  they are always bending though and literally become little daggers cutting into the bridge of your nose
love this product  i noticed a huge difference in my skin after using it for a while
my feet thank you homedics
whether you believe in the power of chakras or not this black tourmaline pyramid is an attractive piece to display on your table it has the weight and heft of a paperweight so i dont see any reason why it cant be used as such it has a lot of sparkly stones on the inside with a crystal wrapped several times over with copper wire the bottom has a copper wire as well in a circle i dont know that much about chakras but just looking at this beautiful item makes me feel calmer
what a back saver 
ordered this to help with removing old boat decals from 2010 what a waste of  figured at the price it should be fantastic lesson learned just because it cost five or six times more does not mean it works half as good as others also no refunds they do not stand by their product use acetone or goo be gone and save your money sure wish i did
i love these found them while traveling through ireland and now cannot use anything else
junk arrived doa
made very well helped with my pain
yes i really like this product
they work great theyre ear plugs i got tired of using balled up kleenex the only issue is the vibration noise of the cord traveling into the ear canal when it moves around while trying to study  i have used a pair of foam plugs from work that have a plastic cord and its quieteri like these tho i take the cord off to study for school doesnt matter as much if im doing yardwork or in a high noise environment
use this a few times a week on a bichon and it keeps her eyes bright and clean
nobody to blame but myself you get what you pay for  i used this thing for just a few minutes before it had to come off and hasnt been used since  save your money  get something that is fully functional
not pure silicone i have a corn intolerance which is in everything used these last night and woke up with swollen sinuses itchy ears  and i almost couldnt get the plugs out because my inner ear was swollen so bad an hour later after getting them out and the swelling is going down dont get off youre sensitive to things thankfully i still had prednisone in my system from a shot 2 days ago
i think it takes a while to seefeel the effects my knees may be feeling a bit better rating may change as i use it longer
these are easy to swallow and supplement our probiotics has helped maintain a healthier feel for both of us these have helped maintain regularity as well as our overall energy levels the ingredients seem to be in line with todays more natural and organic solutions as with all things everyone should be mindful of your own unique digestive tolerances
i have not used it yet but it new and i should have no problems with it  it was a good buy  it really smells godd and it does work for the purpose it ws bought for
i love these reading glasses they are really comfortable and crystal clear i wasnt sure if id like the metal side or not but they havent been a problem at all
i have severe lower back issues this provides great support both in my car seat and my chair
i purchased this in july it is now october so i think that i have used it off and on long enough to give a reviewi say off and on because i am not the most dedicated person in the world when it comes to dieting and taking vitamins and supplements with that said i am very pleased with this product it does what it says blocks the fat and carbs that you eat with your meals  i warn you that you will see the results of that in your bathroom breaks in 812 hours you do become more 34regular34 thats how i know it is working i noticed that i do find myself adjusting my fat and carb intake depending on how often i have to go to the bathroom so in that respect the product is encouraging me to alter my eating habits the bottle is 60 capsules so if you take it diligently it should only last you about a month but as i said im not diligent so this bottle lasted me until now i took maybe two capsules a day maybe twice a week when i remember to  even then i saw the results  i have not lost much weight yet but i havent gained any either and it is encouraging to know that i can continue to use this as a constant reminder to cut back on the chips and ice cream notice i didnt say cut out chips and ice cream heehee
great for use on days you feel to loosen up after splurging on calories
larry uses this every night before bed it says it keeps his feet from burning so he can sleep thanks
im a busy mom of two small children which means im on my feet a lot pretty much all day when i actually get a few minutes to myself ive been really enjoying this foot massager it has variable speeds and pressure as well as heat that really help my feet feel relaxed i feel like its a little rough on my heels and i wish i could turn that part off once it gets uncomfortable but the disc that massages the arches and the balls of the feet feels good the part that goes over your feet inflates to squeeze your feet kind of like a blood pressure cuff and pushes your feet down onto the massager so you get a deep massage on the bottoms of your feet it comes in a nice box and would be a great gift
this is so easy to use and only takes a few minutes per batch very good quality colloidal silver produced i highly recommend this silver generator
great back support for upper and lower good quality durable comfortable
well i can honestly say these band aids dont work but they are good if you want to prevent itching the bite other than that they dont do anything they do stay stuck for a couple of days even after a couple showers i dont know if i will buy again
as of this review i dont know how much these clean wipes costs  i think they do a good job of cleaning and are about the same size as a full sized kleenex but much stronger and can be used multiple times  i think the idea is that they dont shed any fibers which is great for places where tiny fibers can interfere with sensitive equipment  electronics labs and the situations given on the product page
bought as a gift for my brother who rolls his own bagged tobacco he was only able to use it for 3 months before it broke
have heard iffy reviews about ordering oils on line absolutely not true in this case product arrived well protected and oil is amazing
love these bags theyre absolutely beautiful im obsessed with anything holo and had to grab them and im glad i did theyre well made resealable bags that are very thick could be great for storing candy snacks various herbs little parts the sky is the limit you can use a heat thing and seal the top up easily too these things are just amazing
 does exactly what its supposed to do
easy to use and it really does squeeze all the dirty liquid from the pad so youre not mopping with a completely dirty pad
i purchased this repellent for my infant because it didnt have deet eww deet is smelly i absolutely hate seeing mosquito bites on her including her face i needed to get something gentle on her skin and face and as non smelly as possible this stuff actually seems to be working and has not caused any irritation when lightly used on her face we recently went for a walk in a different neighborhood from our own to escape the buggies and as soon as we got out of the car we were bombarded with mosquitoes i quickly applied the repellent on the baby first and you could see the mosquitoes flying around her and the stroller never landing on her skinsmells good and repels id say it works
i got the fitbit aria scale to pair with my fitbit charge and also link with myfitnesspal and in general just make my health journey a bit more streamline and i must admit it really does add value to that compared to my non wifi digital scale that i used for yearsthe design is sleek and sexy i got it in white and is not an eyesore in my bathroom the scale is very responsive and seems to be quite accurate on weight and body fat i love that it autosyncs to my fitbit and myfitnesspal apps so i dont need to worry about remember to manually enter it i also like the feature that it can recognize up to 8 people my bf uses it occasionally and it knows when it is me or him that steps in the scale overall it is certainly overpriced for what it is but if you can get over that i think its a fantastic and sleek fitness tool to have if i didnt usehave a fitbit charge i probably would not be able to justify purchasing this scale but if you do i think you will notice that it does add value to your fitness regimen
i think they are smaller than average deodorant tubes and the lids are a little loose but they work well
the colors are soft the paper absorbent and the overall feel is quality  really like this product and i believe you will too
recently someone sprayed our small office with a couple of squirts of the glade icy evergreen forest  it felt like christmas i was happy to find this spray available at amazon i also purchased the plugin scent warmers
anti fog effectiveness is marginal and my glasses are now constantly smudged cleaning them multiple times a day hoping to totally get rid of this stuff
my shibas love this toy and it can hold up to my pitbullsharpei mixs chewing  i love a toy that all 3 of my dogs can enjoy  im not sure the bristles are doing much cleaning since they seem to prefer chewing on the hard plastic but any chewing is better than none  highly recommend this toy for chewers of all sizes
and have loved it for years i keep this in the shower and when i am done before toweling dry i spray it all over esp on elbows knees  feet then i towel dry  sometimes ill spray a lil on my body when dry if im going for that soft sexy not too shiney look   awesome product highly recommend
i dont know why the description says theres four  i received a threepack of reading glasses with a prescription of 150 in the colors of blue red and brown all of them are in the wayfarer style with half of the stems being a seethrough plastic which is a cool stylistic touch each pair of glasses comes with a matching foam case which makes it easy to identify which is which the lenses are on the thin side but so far they seem durable i like the fact that there are three so that if i lose one i can use the other two as backups
i wear this ever night i was taking 5 or more sleeping pills with no luck by leaving this on i feel well rested there are nights i am awake while it is on but you will go in and out of conscienceness without recognizing the night goes by in minutes but this is due to restlessness
love this file hard to get in stores
my kid did not appreciate flavor
my hair needs to get a little longer and i think this tool will work great  my hair doesnt stay in it very well at its current length
he did not measure properly its too small but were using it
this product i take at night to help me relax and get a good night sleep it has also helped with leg cramps i love this product
loved the how well the cleaners worked but only like the lemon smell the lavender or whatever the purple bottle was had a horrible smell
tastes great and peps you up
this just works
these are thick and comfortable and fit well in my shoes these are wellmade
it works but doesnt shave very close  dissappointing
so i originally gave these earplugs a 1 star review i had used them as directed and they didnt stay in at all then some time later i couldnt find the ones i had been using instead another brand so i looked at the quies earplugs again and decided to try to make them worki took one earplug divided it into half kneaded each half to soften them up and pressed them over my ear canalsthey actually work better this way than the other brand as when split in half the wax core is exposed the cotton holds them in my ears better as they wick the moisture from my ears the other brand doesnt ive been using these ever since and will reorder when needed
love these  the colors are bright like i wanted
bought this for my husband not very palatable and ended up throwing away if it doesnt taste good its not going to be used no matter how good it might be for you
i take hot yoga and need a good mat cleaner that doesnt irritate my skin or make a room full of people escape from the smell this is it  moderate and mild aroma cleans well enough for general surface cleaning needs and the towel is washable with a decent washcloth size to it
glasses adhere for a few minutes but the eventually just get greasy and slide off more than usual
love this my son will not take the little citrus fruit flavored probiotics ive tried three different kinds he spits them out as soon as they hit his mouth these are individually packaged so its not a guessing game with how much to give i just sneak a packet into his morning bottle of milk and in ten minutes hes had his full serving of probiotics and prebiotics for the day its pretty cool especially with cold season coming upon us i want to get a head of the game and build his little immune system theyve worked wonders for me would definitely recommend them 
legitimate product though cost is high
nice white mask but too big
are you kidding me wonderful product with great application thank you will refer clients to you
this stuff is the greatest 
i needed a soupy toothpaste for my newfangled ultrasonic toothbrush this is basically like a mouthwash all liquid i like the dispenser and intend to make a liquidy toothpaste and put into this dispenser so basically i bought an 8 dispenser it was worth a shot but i would say save your money
exactly as expected each letter comes with two small hole punches for extra sturdiness and the string to wind through to create the banner all letters were present and the quality of the glitter card stock was good excellent value for the price shipped in packaging that kept the letters from bending
i guess i mean i didnt get sick on my trip abroad  12h plane rides included
cla is a secret ive used for years to control my weight and help me build and retain muscle this formulation is very potent the serving size is four capsules you can split this into two each with your two largest meals i highly recommend this productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
these restrict airflow so you wake up in the middle of the night with a headache cause you cant breathe
i cant complain about the product or the amount of time it took to get the items  the only thing that was a little concerning was how easily the protective seal came off the top of the bottle when i opened it  it was sealed but i suspect it was the glue used at the time of manufacturing  other than that the item was as described and delivered promptly  the price was also reasonable  i would buy from this seller again
i had 2 and in our house i noticed the moldmildew was gone in the 2 rooms i had them in yet some times the rest of the house had a old stale smell hard to explain so i purchased 2 more  i have 6 rooms total in my house and by adding these two units the house smells fresh  clean all the time  i have not had to replace any of the bulbs yet and ive had 2 for over a year  i am so pleased with this product
i was really looking forward to trying this product because it is vegan and organic but no matter what ingredients i add to it it makes my smoothies taste rancid im not sure if i got a bad product or not but regardless its not for me i have found other protein powders that are plant based that taste great or at least arent noticeable when combined with other ingredients this one even smells odd
if you want a good facial cleansing brush but dont want to spend 200 this is a good alternative the brush is compact and easy to hold it doesnt take up much space on a counter it also packs well for travel its cordless and rechargeable its a good skincare tool dont forget to clean your brush with antibacterial soap after each usethanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
these clippers are a strong sturdy and sharp but theyre a little tight to use i dont have a lot of strength in my hands
made well great value and shipping was speedy
im so glad i found these i know apple cider vinegar is good for you but i love the gummies much better easier for oral consumption  excellent detox
too soon to tell that its whitening but i find that its really great on killing the morning breath and great for use after meals especially lunch time at the office for those of you who do that sorta thing
much smaller than i expected and not very soft at all
yes  i bought this because it is kleenix  i knew it would be soft and especially absorbent  there is no fragrance  just simple softness  and  reason for absorbency  two ply
it works as described i recommend this product
super cute great as party favors for our daughters birthday party
these are not extra wide and they are not diabetic socks they were regular socks and amazon is not looking at these vendors close enough
excellent sturdy product i have only used it a couple of days so far but i definitely prefer the clips over other styles i had before with the loop attachments i will be ordering more in different styles highly recommend this seller
i do not like it this brand it comes on at barely a touch the cord is short and the speed is not what i am use too i will not buy it again or refer it i wish i could of sent it back
easy to attach smaller than i thought but it is still a good size it is very sturdy too
this sound machine comes with a total of 24 sounds it is packaged with an ac adapter the unit itself a cheat sheet circle and a regular instruction pamphletoperation is simple as per my video i just plugged it in and then pressed the light button for my choice of nightlight color i also pressed the sound playing button to start playing the sounds this button serves as the onoff button for the unit the nightlight feature has seven lights that can be cycled through with two variations of white light the timer feature goes from 15 30 60 90 and 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously there are three sound controls  naturelullaby white noise and fan there are 8 available sounds each for the white noise and fan and 16 nature sounds i particularly like the nature soundsthe current price of 2599  is what machines like this go for of course in the days of smart home speakers such as google home no such device is really needed as i can just ask my google home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine nevertheless for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves this does work know that there will never be more than 24 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds only a few of them will ever be playedi rated this unit three stars for several reasons first i prefer a battery operated unit correction to what i said in my video i do not like the idea that i have to be tethered to a power supply to operate this and want to be able to take it with me anywhere second the controls on top are very difficult to see see photo the printing needs to be a bright white so that it is visible to the operator third the unit is not as sleek as some other units i tried previouslyits tall and squat nevertheless this works as designed and it is a good machine but this is not my top pick
my kids love mario and these bandaids are too cute decent quality too must have for mario fans my kids are 7 and 2 and love them too expensive though
this matters or not dont waste your time but i wont have to match them make it look like theyre tall the matches but then not
these patches really do relieve the pain they can be cut to whatever size you needthey stick extremely well
i used this on an offwhite bench cushion we have in our home  the directions are clear and easy to follow  so far whenever weve gotten dirt or anything else on the cushion weve been able to just brush it off  there is no smell and its nontoxic
great quality and lovely colors  better than i expected for the price  does a great job on my nails and doesnt cause splitting like emery boards
ive been taking 3 tablespoons of this about every other day for about 2 months  there is no doubt it is the real deal  i do feel better but i personally have had unfavorable results  for one i was one of those people who gained weight very easily from taking it i dont know why  i wasnt underweight  i have also noticed that my cycle which has always been off since i was a teenager and had somewhat regulated after the birth of my daughter is now sporadic again  i went 40 days last cycle and now am at like day 46 and still no periodi will continue taking this and probably purchase again  it isnt  the macas team fault my body is reacting this way but my body is reacting and that means the powder is working  i will finish the bag and hope my body settles down  it might take awhile as i started this powder with a pretty big hormonal imbalance
all ingredients come packaged separately in a nice little clear box i followed directions exactly and the soup was delicious i am hoping it will knock this cold i have been fighting for the last week
i am always hoping to find something to curb my appetite  i did not notice any change while using these
and it makes it cute
a however a bit difficult to program
great keto product taste is good and adds a good balance to your day
these vials are very expensive the saline solution is ok the packaging is terrible  when the vial is opened the hole in the vial doesnt squirt directly down into the lens consistently causing a lot of wasted product  the vials do not stand vertically so they leak or become contaminated  i only bought this brand because scleralfil was backordered
i had previously left a 3 star review since i was able to get a smooth shave the first time i used it ive always had trouble shaving intimate areas because of razor burn and ingrown hairs i was very hesitant in purchasing this product because ive tried countless shavers epilators razors you name it  ive probably tried iti used this product one time and it was pretty cool that you use it wet so i decided to try it out in the bathtub it shaved very well even though it was rather difficult reaching some places now the aloe strips helped tremendously and i was quite pleased with the results however after using this one time the aloe strips were ruined and i couldnt use the shaver again because it caused horrible razor burn and didnt get nearly as close of a shave as before there also isnt an option to purchase more aloe strips without having to buy a whole replacement head i contacted customer service and sent pictures of the aloe strips and explained the situation long story short they offered half my money back so id be stuck with a shaver i cant use and half of a refund  no thank you i ended up returning the item dont waste your money on one good shave
if youve ever ruined an item of clothing or upholstery due to a stain youll definitely want this product the spray protects fabrics from all kinds of stains you may want to apply a few layers for some fabrics i highly recommend this productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
i have 3 verilux lamps including this one so that i can use them at my piano reading chair and at bedside  these are sturdy lamps with a nice clean design and a variety of colors to compliment any decor my favorite is the ivory  i have presbyopia and early cataracts so can benefit greatly from higher contrast in reading and needlework these lamps are beyond meeting my expectations  whereas i used to have a lot of eye fatigue and got sleepy while reading at night this is no longer the case the black print appears darker sharper as if id upgraded my glass prescription i find that i have sufficient spread of light for reading an average newspaper page even the newspaper stock quote pages are now readable whereas this isnt the case otherwise  i also do a lot of watercolor painting and needlepoint it is a treat to be able to work into the evening while being confident that my color mixes are true  here is an amusing side note which supports that the light approximates daylightmy elderly cat who enjoys a daily bath in outdoor sunlight sometimes substitutes the verilux lamp light for his spa when the weather is bad it cant be the heat that he is drawn to as little is given off  i can appreciate some reviewers observations that the quality of the light is perhaps overly white yet the lamp is not intended for ambient lighting but rather for a small task area  the light bulbs are not pricey when you consider that they last for 5 years and are thus an average cost of 4 a year also they use less than 15 of the electricity of a traditional 150 watt reading light  if making a decision to purchase this lamp i would suggest that you base it upon your need or wish to have better clarity in visual work at night it is not intended to add daylight to a room  there are many cheaper verilux lookalikes but i wouldnt recommend these there are serious complaintsthat these fall apart in a year or two or fail to work from the beginning
wife didnt like it unfortunately kind of bulky to carry
not worth to send back just bought by mistake wrong model
cleaning myself
perfect for the dessert bar the right size  they are thick and not cheesy looking 
cuticle trimmer is not sharp or  precise
i ended up gifting this however the recipient was overjoyed
great product great seller
i have used at least 10 of these grabbers over the last 8 years that ive been wheelchair bound they are remarkable in design but on this particular one the handle split on the 2nd day of use it is not the norm an i will be asking for a replacement i will update my comments then 
did nothing for me made me hungry after taking it
second time ordering and they are fresh  not dried out or stale like others selling the same product
do the job very nicelygreat cushionhave purchased before
good price like them
these can be a little difficult im still trying to get them to stay on and fold right even with cleaning my eye area very well they only stay struck on for about 6 minutes but its only the outer corners that keep lifting up
absolutely horrible these are like cheap thin mylar disposable one use only they cant be reused they were so frustrating to wrap up much worse than real christmas presents you have to assemble them they lose air fast
works great  and i think its good for your gums too
these ear plugs are on the large side i ordered them because the picture looked like they were similar to silicone ear plugs my cat stole from me the design is pretty much the same but the size is not these barely fit into my ears and dont go in far enough to block much sound i still like them better than the foam ones those itch but these are not for meif your ear canals are not on the small side i do recommend this type of plug its cleaner and more comfortable than foam and you can wash it
i heard so many great things about adding mushroom supplements to a daily vitamin routine so i gave it a go this brand has been working well and i can tell im more focused at work
i hate all the artificial colors and flavors in gatorade so this is a great alternative i followed the directions and mixed it with 8 oz of cold water and it was easy to dissolve and tasted like sugar water would probably taste better mixed with a little juice to give it some flavor for a child but overall seems like a great product for all members of the family
easy to assemble and decent construction these boxes will be perfect for holding party favors or small beauty products for a beautiful unboxing experience i used some of these for an event and others for giving out graduation gifts and they all looked great no matter the occasion
these containers are very similar to glad or ziploc products  while they are reusable they definitely feel like the kind of product that ends up being thrown away after a few uses  if you want to decrease your plastic use or help the environment glass bento type boxes are probably the way to go  that said these are very convenient  they have two separate sections for food  they seal well  i did have some issues with the lids warping in the dishwasher  overall for the price a decent productif you found my review helpful please click yes below  thank you
the cat was interested in this toy for maybe 510 minutes then it was batted under the couch never to be seen againthe problem is that it shuts off almost immediately when stationary it would be better to have a 1 minute cutoff at least keeping the cats attention a bit longercat says meh
construction quality materials similar to most of the other lipo bags available  purchase for part of the storage setup of some 3s lipos  more or less just one added layer of protection against a lipo incident  during charging continuous monitoring of the lipo internal temp external temp charging rateslevels smell sight is more important than the bag in preventing an ugly situationif you experience a real catastrophic lipo event this bag might give you enough time to grab whatever fire suppression device you have to deal with the situation the bag is a bit like airbags and seatbelts in a vehicle  hope you never have to rely on device  but in the event a bad situation occurs the bag may be the difference between a major or minor loss  personally i wouldnt store charge or use  questionable lipos  dispose properly and invest in a replacement
was a little big and everyone laughed but i could fit everything in this thing and it would sit on my back side so it didnt get in the way for me  the only reason why i had to give it up was because my instructor said that if i wore this at clinicals i would spread germs from room to room without knowing it  i guess it very well could have however my shoes dont spread germs  my clothes  i had to stop wearing it but i save it for when i am done and a hospital lets me wear it  i can even put my stethoscope in it
the electric cord could be longer but other than that my boyfriend likes it it heats up well and relieves his neck and back pain being able to button it up to keep it in place is definitely a plus
i bought this and it came in perfect condition and right on timethis is a nice toy that is not to big and fun to use  it is very comfortable to use and enhances your experience  i was not disappointed with this at all
these inserts will stick to sandals  sandals need support for anyone
ive been overall happy with this not having to try to maneuver around a cord while using it has been very helpful and the battery last long enough for grooming jobs that can be done at home
these are gelatin based dimesized disks that are a babys first introduction to popping sugary sweet snacks into their mouthaccording to the package your baby can safely have these when they crawl with tummy off the floor pulls up to a standing position uses jaw to mash foods and uses fingers to self feed because they quickly dissolve they are probably one of the safest small foodsthey are relatively wholesome with milk products as the main ingredient and a healthy dose of potassium taste tested by meyucky taste tested by a 18 month oldyummythe problem i have and its a small one this product is ok in my book is that they seem to encourage parents to get kids started as early as possible to have sweet snacking habits i have a friend who thought it was fine to make her babys first food like this a fast food french fry this is a much better option
this product is fanastic i love the flavor and the fast acting that happens after you chew them the taste is great not chalky at all
i purchased this to make bubbles with for my 2 year old son the product did great and the bubbles were the strongest ive ever seen so much better than buying watered down soap from the store
easy to use and looks fantastic  do not worry the scale works fine  am super pleased with my purchase  only very small drawback for me was that fingerprints show easily but are easily removed with a cloth
this is the only powder i use in my dishwasher  have tried others but they do not clean as well
i absolutely love this it works perfectly
easy to assemble easy to operate gives a great infrared session directly where you need it shipped promptly  good price would purchase again
beautiful stone but it did not really work for me i think i am better off buying these in person i have had better luck
quality product  good price
i saw and bought this product at vitamin shoppe because it had 5 atp royal jelly and several other really good ingredients ive taken nootropics by a very reputable company but they changed their formula and its not as good as it was beforei took one pill before lunch to see what type off effect it would have on me it didnt seem to have any kind of effect on me so i felt confident in taking the 2 tablets as prescribed before breakfast with 8oz of water i didnt notice any improvement on my focus but i didnt get my 4pm slump instead i got a severe debilitating headache i made sure i was hydrating really well by 6 and 7pm my muscles in my entire body began to ache especially around my mid back and i got ringing in my ears ibe ringing in the ears usually means something with the kidneys  i went to bed and continued to drink lots of water and tried to get some sea salt in me to keep my electrolytes in balancethe following day after 13 hours of sleep i usually get 5 i woke up without the headache and almost all of the pain in the back had subsided except between my shoulder blades i felt very light headed so i made sure to continue to hydrate and eat well had i felt the way i did i took the two tablets i would have gone to the hospital i dont go to the hospitals i was that sick from thistheres a lot of ingredients in this supplement proceed with caution the risks definitely outweighed any possible benefit im a super healthy person so i cant imagine what might happen to someone who is not in as great of shape as i am
love this product full of protein and fiber and taste greatmy daughter even loves it  i add bananas blueberries all kinds of fruitsand it fills me up as well
screw and parts they arrived in new condition i carry one in my car backpack nightstand etc cheap and effective 
this plastic bucket was just what i was looking for  something i could fill up with warm to hot water and soak my feet in while i am sitting on the sofa watching tv at night  my feet fit in it perfectly and i wear 95 mensfilled about 34 of the way with water it can get heavy but the handle doesnt feel flimsy  dont fill to the top or else water may splash out as you carry it  the bottom has little massaging bumps  kinda like reflexologyif you are the type to balk at paying 1518 for a plastic bucket this is not for you id recommend you get two rubbermaid buckets and use those instead  sometimes you have to splurge and get the thing that best fits your needs and is designed for the purposethis bucket does not keep the water hot or warm  it is just a plastic bucket but it should be enough for a good 1520 min soak if you start with water thats hot enough
beautiful pendulum and received close to pictured
excellent  best microfiber cloth for cleaning eyeglass lens leaving them without streaks
sorry but this one is a bust the plastic is too hard and not flexible enough wont stay closed around my hair cant imagine it working for anyone
good dealprice does what it was designed to do cant really elaborate
i didnt expect so many herbsthe package came in very quickly aswell happy buyer
didnt seem to do anything for me
i commend the seller magickal night the shipping was quick and arrived earlier than anticipated likewise they very safely packaged the item which is encouraging to purchase from them again7 sisters of new orleans glory water is what it is a mass manufactured spiritual product 7 sisters of course is one of the 4 or 5 other brands that indiowisdom owns which originally were small independent companies therefore there is a caveat to their item eg formulas got standardized between brands some things smell the same but have different packaging however these specialty items arent as terrible as ive found likely because if its a unique item then there isnt some cost effective equivalent to sell as a dupe this may also be why wisdoms own website has listed glory water as out of stock for almost a year if not morethe sent of glory water is nice somewhat sweet and colognelike unfortunately the scent easily dissipates when its sprinkled or dabbed on anythingoverall im not dissatisfied and is a nice addition to my spiritual supplies collection
item has too much of a bend in it to be used ccomfortably
i wanted to try these brackets both to create more space for breathing while wearing a mask and also to prevent my makeup from getting on the mask  unfortunately i found these a little tricky to use  they are kind of bulkyyou can see them poking out of the top of my mask plus you can see the bumps and ridges under the mask which looks a bit weird  but despite their bulkiness they were also a little small for my face shape as they kept slipping off my nose  and they didnt make it easier to talk as they moved even more with speaking  i might use these for certain situations but overall i wouldnt recommend them
i got one of these for myself a few months ago because i read they can help with scalp itch i dont have dandruff but i do have dry scalp thanks winter and some irritation due to using dry shampoo admittedly it felt weird to use at first but after just the first use my scalp was itching less after i added the use of an apple cider vinegar clarifying shampoo the itchy scalp is gone it has made a noticeable difference in terms of scalp itch and how clean my hair looks and feels i was excited and told my husband about my triumph over itchy scalp and the next thing i know he has started using my shampoo brush even though he made fun of me for using it in the first place he has some dandruff but doesnt have the itchy scalp im not sure if it has helped him or not but he must enjoy using the brush because he keeps using mine this is the exact reason i have now bought a second one we both enjoy using it
in the description you get easy to use it has two fixing clips on both sides and you can hang the 3d bracket on the face cover to prevent sliding then put on the face cover as usual no you cant further down you will see that they recommend either sewing it in place or using double sided tape i was able to wear mine without any complications
knocks out all my aches  pains
ive tried a view this one tastes good and dissolves more easily than others ive ordered again already many thanks
i like that it doesnt bother my digestive track
resolve your rug cleaning problems we purchased our own steam cleaner a few years ago and found this cleaner to beat all the rest  anyone who has self cleaned their carpets knows  the products they use makes a big difference in how many times they have to go back and forth this resolve concentrate 2x does the trick cleans up spills and  leaves such a clean smell
i like the value of getting ten boxes at once and you cant go wrong with puffs
they arrived well packaged and they are excellent value for the 10 pack
this makes my skin feel so nice and clean also super soft afterwards i love it  def worth it and youre not going to find it cheaper anywhere else
i bought this for my teenage daughter and she says it worked out very well for her hair her hair is curly and wavy but the drying works really well and she is able to style her hair accordingly there are three different measures of heat and she finds the medium and high features to work best for her overall  great purchase so far
this is by far the best glue out there  stays long and is waterproof  great for someone like me who is active
my daughter is the one who really uses selfiesticks and anything that will help her make movies with her iphone  she likes this selfiestick tripod a lot and especially that it has a place to hold the remote  the bluetooth connected easily to her phone and she was soon taking pictures with her phone in it  it doesnt go as high as her other iphone tripod but its very portable  the tripod legs are kind of short and the stability is not real good but it will do  she will be using this for class projects where she has make movies or video tape home physics experiments
great flavor do have to worry a little about getting to the bathroom
these are not individually wrapped so i cant use them as they are to give my dog medicine when i get them from the vet they are individually wrapped
slim lightweight pocket umbrella its size and weight make it easy to slip in a coat pocket or handbag it is a regular umbrella not particularly sturdy when the wind gusts in new york city the wind tunnels can be brutal and have ruinedinverted all but the sturdiest umbrellas i still have to put this to the test i suspect it will be similar to drugstore umbrellas
fits well on my average sized female head  i keep it in the freezer for use whenever i need  i was almost scared to use it for fear it would be too tight but it is not too too tight and the compression feels goodi recently had an 18 hour migraine triggered by sleeping wrong on an old neck injury  the type of pulsating headache that no amount of changing positions in the bed would relieve the pain  light and sound were unbearable  i cannot take any meds for my migraines so i use a variety of supplements showers ice heat etc to try and bring comfort a nice tool in my migraine arsenal toolbox  i rotate it out with other things and it helps take the edge off  with this last spell this compression cap was just the ticket  it allowed the pain to numb just a hair and i fell into a much needed mini nap  that was the beginning of the end of the this particular migraineno complaints or regrets
better than the more expensive kind i was getting that were jammed in a box and hard to use i dont need a industrial weight bag so there work great and for less money  delighted
really was excited to get this product due to the practically of it then i received the productpro very well made  qualitygreat designcons priceyvery heavylarge devicei rated this item three 3 stars for these reasons the weight of this product limited me to carry my medications on me which was the whole reason i purchased it and secondary the price of the productupdate  i have received a personal phone call from the owner we talked about her product line and during the conversation she really showed me her commitment to customers and designing great productswhen ordering just make sure you get the appropriate size that is going to meet your needs also if weight is going to be a  consideration than i would suggest ordering a device in titanium i am awaiting a new titanium dual camber device i will update after i compare the products side by side
these protect the placard from bending in the heat etc  a good clear way to protect the placard and easy to see and hang in the car
myclub wont let me tan unless i have eyeweari put these on my keychain with mycomputerpass and bingo never without
i like shower poufs have used them for decades now its rare to find black ones my favorite color these are reasonably soft softer than some ive bought at the grocery store theyre very big and dense almost but not quite too big to hold onto ive nearly dropped one several times but always managed to maintain my grip i would probably prefer these a bit smaller but since theyre in my favorite color i wont complain too much they hold a lot of soap and build lather well
originally i was taking the one a day trunatal ginger gel capsules and i was so disappointed that they were discontinued i found these and im happy to say they work just as well if not better give them a try if you suffer from morning sickness or nausea for any other reason
very satisfied with the scooter i have problems with my feet and stress fractures i bought the scooter so i would have it if i needed it and not have to rent one
this is a great little toner the spray has a fine little mist and works very well i cleanses my face beautifully and feels very refreshing when i use it after i use this my face feels nice and clean i do like the smell of this and feel super refreshed every time i use this i do like that this has witch hazel in the ingredient list which is a very calming ingredient it also has other fantastic ingredients like chamomile and ginsengthis is a great find and am happy i found this toner
this product is very quiet you dont know its on the price was right with the 3000 coupon it also has a 2 year warranty that you have to register before 30 days after purchase
i have no idea if this works or not so i dont know how to rate it
this smells so good i use it for shaving and its such a great value it doesnt leave a residue like a lot of the lower end baby oils and its a pretty large bottle
im incredibly disappointed in this product after 2 weeks of using this diffuser its already brokendoesnt work ill add the water and essential oil and after 2 minutes of being on it turns itself off ive tried plugging it into different outlets and selecting different settings and it still does not work
i love the color there is no smell which surprises me because most of the other natural nail polishes i have tried do have smell the only thing i dont like is how fast it chips it doesnt really stick to the nail maybe if i get a great base coat it will stay better
i love the sleek black color of this stretcher there are no instructions in the package but information is available here on the site google cervical traction and you will find examples exercises and more information as always make sure you are in communication with your doctor or chiropractor to make sure youre on the right paththe last neck stretcher i used was plastic with foam around it and naturally the foam disintegrated over time i appreciate this stretcher which seems to be a very dense foam the sides seem to push on my occipital bones to encourage a stretch i make sure that the base is right against my shoulders so those little points are in place i only use for 1015 minutes at a time usually at the end of the day this helps me regain curvature in my neck to compensate for my desk job i love this particular model and enjoy using it to relieve neck tension after work recommended
my acupuncturist used this oil and i have continued to use itgreat product
i got this because it says that its flavored portable and figured it would be good to add into my water bottle during hot  yoga it tastes gross and you need a comedic amount of drops if you have a large water bottle  its not that i am not used to the taste of stevia it just has a bad berry flavor the bottle also isnt portable its pretty big probably because you need so many drops to make it work if it leaks then youve got another mess on your handsstick with nuun tablets they taste a lot better one does the job and they are in a portable container that cant spillthis is bitter and id use it if i were sick or something but its really a slight degree away from pedialyte
nice size picks up dus like a pro comes with extra refill
sealed my granite put on two coats and still have a lot left over i would recommend
i like plastic frames but they slide off my nose when i am working and looking downward i thought i was going to have to get the side pieces extended but i saw this and it works perfectly  although they seem a little flimsy you get ten pieces works like a charm perfectly comfortable
this replacement brush is just like the real clarisonic brushes i was pleasantly surprised how well they worked and also the pricecant be beatyou will not be disappointed
great replacements convenient order from amazon with great price
we need alcohol pads and these where a great price for the same item that we had purchased before in smaller volume  fast delivery
i had at once gavin this a 3 star now im giving it a one star all of my pastries stick to this paper i just made french macaroons and they stuck so bad they tore apart what a waste of time and expense i bake all the time now i have to go back and search for the sheets i purchased over a year ago they worked wonderful no sticking at all these sheets even look and feel different then the other brand no i dont recommend
nice and comforting
the advertisement says five pack per box i received a ziploc bag sealed with for only four i tried it on their comfortable there nice nice color but theres not side theres four
this thing is amazing you can use it dry or in the tub with water it is gentle but does a wonderful job of smoothing heels
helps along with other powdered supplements
this product is amazing  i have tried many many creams lotions special socks microplaners and anything else that advertises they can get rid of your cracked heels  nothing has worked even at the nail salon i have never left satisfied with how my heels felt i had resigned myself to the fact i was never going to have smooth feet again  but this thing works  i read reviews where people said it stops if you push down on it well there is a reason for that if you push too hard you can hurt yourself its a safety mechanism that makes sense just be patient and it will work  ive used it three times since christmas even though my heels were still pretty smooth i just like the way it feels  if you have rough feet you will be amazed at the snow shower you create using this  put down a towel or something to catch all the lovely dead skin that comes showering down  buy this  you will love it
makes my glasses cleaner than other products ive used small bottles make it easy to take in purse or keep in desk
these are nice little travel packs to bring along in a pinch when you are out of smaller tooth paste and mouth wash plus a small size of spritz breath spray these packs are very small and easy to store and bring along these work pretty well i am not a huge fan of the breath spray but that is just because i dont generally use them so i wish they would have included more mouth wash and tooth paste since those i use a lot more
i have bought this product 3 times i was perfectly satisfied with the first two orders but the most recent september 2022 is clearly different the floss is thinner and shreds easily it slips from my finger even when wrapped around five times in a word the floss is useless
great fit great feel 
good value for your money i have reactions to some contact solution but this works well for me i use optifree as well
had  for awhile now and it  hasnt fallen apart so all is well
i love this bracelet perfect fit for ladies with small wrists i were it all the time even in water and has not tarnished
this thing has got some power  it does a nice job gently removing callous  i was even able to carefully remove a callous between my toes that has caused me pain for a long time  pain is gone  i recommend it  its been worth every penny to me so far
it works really well totally eliminated the dogs odor he has his own gated area of the back of our kitchen that always smells not when this is plugged in and we have a large open kitchen just make sure its near the source
i have the galaxyd color option which includes 2 adult size masks and 4 pm25 filters the galaxyd color is a blue green and teal nebulathe masks have adjustable ear loops but no bendy nose pieces however the cut of the masks does keep them in place over my nose without the need for the nose wire the masks also go under my chinthey pass the candle test the masks have three layers of fabric even without a filter in place the outer layer with the nebula print a white lining and the filter pocket the filter pocket is open on both sidesat the longest point the masks are about 10105 inches the widest point from nose to chin is about 555 inches i took these measurements after washing the masks in warm water and line dryingthe masks are quite large on my face i usually wear smaller masks the sides on these go nearly to my ears and i have the ear loops adjusted to be as small as they can gothe masks are made in china
product is was described
these are hard to find in a store exactly what i was looking for thicker longer and higher quality
cheaper than the tool truck and same great fit
this hot water bottle has thicker walls than most ive owned which is really nice the texture of one side actually helps keep you from getting too hot and adding the hot water bottle sweater helps even more if you want moist heat just add a damp washcloth between the hot water bottle and its sweater just remember to empty it after use and do not microwave it
i cant find better words to describe how glad i am to have discovered this product than to say  it saved my dogs life hallelujah
works well with the phillips electric toothbrush
these worked very good we were having issues with safety glasses fogging up while wearing our covid masks these lasted a long time and worked great
great straws just as described and i feel good about not buying plastic ones anymore especially after watching those sad sealife videos online of plastic in the ocean they are stylish too
much to my shock and thanks to my sister for championing this product and delighted surprise this is the first protein shake that i can actually say i truly like and enjoy drinking  i admit i do use milk in the mix but i didnt even try water and its a pleasure to drink a fivestar yum
updateitem did not make the 2 month anniversary  for this reason i have updated the ratingthis water pik for teeth is what i wanted  with 3 speeds it meets my every expectation  my gums are benefiting from the pulsating action  it keeps the extraction area clean low setting where the brush seems to miss
purchased this product a second timedoes work and open skin pores
i am wearing masks everywhere i go i have been searching for the holy grail of masks i have used the pieces inside the mask that are supposed to make it more comfortable and cooler doesnt work  i have tried the k95 masks even one that gives you a daffy duck look and other k95 that are more comfortable i have used home made cloth masks and none keep me from fogging up my glasses or allow me some coolness when i talk i think i am claustrophobic
this stuff works great for tough stains on baby kids and adults clothes it removes everything baby food formula spit up stains even old spit up stains even with little scrubbing and even stains from blow out diapers i will never use another stain remover again just this one
i am not all that happy with liquid detergents and when i first found a detergent strip that i could tear off of a set of four and throw in my washing machine i was hoping for a good result  and they work great  i saw this one and figured id try a different brand and these work great as well  i love that they are small and nonmessy easily stored and if i was going rving and needed to wash clothes these are easier to take into a laundromat  dont even have to take the box  just grab one or two depending on how many clothes you need to wash in 1 or 2 machines  so much easier than dragging around a bottle of liquid detergent or paying an exorbitant amount of money for one of those tiny ones at the laundromat  maybe these arent for everybody but for me they work great to clean my clothes and are much easier to store and use
i really enjoy dripdrop when needed  i cant locate this product in my area so i order from drip drop through amazon  its purpose is to hydrate and  i think it works well
i have to have a bandage that doesnt stick to the wound
this sponge does not work i scrubbed and scrubbed but nothing came out from my skin i just saw my skin was red from scrubbing so hard dont buy this item i tossed them in the trash what a waste
good size but a bit pricey for a sponge  ok if it holds up as my former one did
was good product east to install stick and twist even i could do it with arthritis in my hands it mad reach for handheld a joy
great earplugs at a great price i use these for shooting and they do great ive shot all calibers including 50bmg and havent had an issue i also love the cord because i can take one or both out and it doesnt get lost it just hangs down or around your neck if you value your hearing and work around loud machinery or shoot often these are great earplugs to use
they fit nicely some of the oral tips you have to fight to get them in not with this one
not what i expected beard to pump up i am returning it
i use this to brushclean my cats teeth and they work better than i expected i can use the same sponge 5 to 7 times without having it break considering how sharp cats teeth are my cat does not resist so is an easy process i dont need to maneuver the sponge in a forceful way at all when it breaks just cracks so far i havent had a sponge breaking into pieces i use it moist with the teeth cleaning spray they sell for pets i have never used it dry
not sure why people say these are too small  they are the exact right size for me  ive bought these glasses a couple of times over the past decade and theyve held up well  the lens are distortionfree ang the frames are attractive and strong  exactly what i needed
not for tender skin but it is the best joint pain reliever
exactly like the kind i buy in the store for a fraction of the cost theyre also easy to cut down to size to fit different sized soles or heels
i bought this product to try removing the soft peach fuzz on my face  ive previously used a disposable razor and microblading tools and was looking for something that was more effective and efficienti tried both the razor function and the epilator function  the directions contained in the box were clear and easy to understand  i appreciated that it came with paper instructions instead of many items now that do not and require you to watch a video online  the paper instructions were much easier to take in my bathroom as i tried for the first time instead of my laptop and a videoi tried both functions on my arm first the high speed of the epilator was a bit uncomfortable  tried on my face  tried the razor first  then changed to the epilator i first tried on low and then on high  mistake  the machine literally caught my skin in it when on high speed  it cut the surface of the skin and left a mark like a cat scratched my facesee photo  that was iti was done no morethere are 2 detachable pieces to switch between depending upon whether you want to use razor or epilator mode  they easily come off  its clearobvious how to align each piece and attachcouple of notesonoff button is stiff to use  it doesnt glide onoff  not a problem  merely fyicomes with batteries  that was a plus because it saved me a few more the device is a bit loud in my opinion  you could not discreetly use this productwas difficult to use in the jaw line which is the area i most wanted to use it oni will not be using this device again  i will go back to using my inexpensive micro blading tools
its so quiet you almost forget it on i have 3 cats and a dog so im sure the house can smell like pets i walk into the room and its just so fresh
cane is very stable and strong it is worth the price
definitely one of the best natural sunscreens out there and i have tried many it rubs in well of course it has a different texture than chemical sunscreen without leaving a white film smells great and works awesome we just gave it the real test in the florida sun and water no sunburn
this does just what it claims to do  love it
i just moved back to an area where im close to an old and very dear friend that i kept in touch with for all the years i lived far away so now that im near i wanted to give her something that she would enjoy and i know how much she enjoys a long leisurely bath  a nobrainer to get bath bombs then  this is a beautiful set that i know she will be happy to receive and thrilled to use once she can lock the bathroom door kidsthey always want to bother mom when shes trying to get a little me time and relax for a time  i love these  for her and others  but i cant take baths any longer as i have health issues that make it difficult for me to get out of the bathtub from that position  i dont envy those who can take a bath  i know my friend will enjoy the bath bombs just as i would if i could
its good in theory but hanging the arms is kind of inconvenient and the rotating shiatsu balls hurt in certain positions especially when they hit my spine it hurt enough that i returned it
easy to use smells great and its all natural  i love love method products
ive had it for just about 2 days thank you for getting it to me days before the initial delivery date i like everything about this chair so far save for 2 items the beeping every time you press a button honestly it is obnoxious and im on the hunt to disable it the turning radius is much larger than i am used to given i had an invacare tdx si this is just an adjustment i have to make to the chair so my mild frustration to it is on methe chair is comfortable it is quiet and i like the little storage bag way more than i expected to after years of just filling my lap getting it ready to use was very simple as well50lbs sounds lighter than it weighs lol itll be easier to go mobile than my old chair which was around 200lbs but it isnt as mobile as i thought it might be we will see how it goesbottom line is i am happy with my purchase had to come out of pocket for this because my old chair just decided nope not working anymore so i needed a replacement quickly
i bought these for a pair of dressy shoes  i usually wear the smart  but old looking orthopedic shoes but these were too darn cute to pass up  i really needed some more support but i honestly didnt expect a lot from these  even though they look simple they actually help a lot  they are very easy to use  simply stick them wherever you need them on the sole of the shoe with the preapplied adhesive  the set includes 3 different colors  but i really like the clear ones  you can barely even see them
save your money and buy a roll of bounty paper towels
it was a nice tray  smaller than i expected but my walker has  rubber grips and the tray didnt fit over it   now what do i do   buy a new walker   idk what to do to be honest  im assuming all trays will have the same issue due to those grips  companies should realize walkers come with grips and make the trays fit either or somehow
use it daily no issues and its been over a month
been using for several years  always does the job
i love tangy tangerine it has all the vitamins you will need good product
im glad this is organic because this powder is often used in traditional chinese medicine given how polluted china is i would distrust anything imported from that country but this one is certified usda organic which gives me some peace of mind you add a scoop to yogurt smoothies etc and its supposed to boost your immune system and improve chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension i dont like the taste but you are taking it for its medicinal properties overall its good quality and best for those suffering from chronic conditions
this is an upgrade from the cheap thin foamfabric shoe insoles it has a nice arch support and adhesive to keep insole in place the leather top also adds a premium feel  i have 3 issues with this product 1 its only a 23 to 34 long insole so your toes wont have any cushioning 2 lining up the insole to my low boots was not easy since the insole is a bit narrower than the boots i had to try several times before finding the best placement it would have been easier with flats with their more open footbed 3 the insole cushioning is limited due to the relatively thin insole 
the pros 1 it has 15 different strains of good bacteria this is the most outstanding feature of this probiotic blend it is the case of more is better diversity of the gut flora means the healthier the digestive tract 2 it is delayed release  this ensures that the good bacterium gets into your lower intestines rather than being destroyed by your stomach acids 3 per serving it has 30 billion cfu of probiotic organisms again more is better 4 i have experienced no adverse reactions to the product 5 my overall digestion has improved resulting in good bowel movements and no constipation the con 1 it contains milk so if you have a diary allergy or intolerance you should not take this productin conclusion premiva ultra probiotic is a good solid product that would likely improve your digestion as well as boost your immunity disclaimer  i was fortunate to receive this complementary probiotic in return for my fair and honest evaluation i am under no obligation to give a favorable review i write these reviews in the hope that they will help other consumers like me to make the best purchasing decisions for their money as an avid researcher i have save myself time money and aggravation by reading other customer reviews and i am grateful to have their input available to me
holy sand paper i wont be using these on my babys perfectly soft tush these things feel like they could take the skin right off
adheres and stays put
smells woodsy like pencil shavings seriously i use it twice a day for a week and heel cracks are healing nice thick consistency without being gooey nice applicator doesnt stain clothes wash right out
i should have replaced the blades years ago they work excellent i even mowed some of those long gray wild chest hairs and outside of needing to clean out the shaver head repeatedly it worked changing the cutters is easier than it looks dont start prying on the little tabs just push the cutters down one at a time and slip out what a deal
this ddgro back brace is made sturdyit feels like there is 3 medal type of thin bars in the back that are comfortablei felt good wearing this  actually for my bad posturemy husband wears this when his back is sore or doing some gardening and lifting thingsmy husband wears jeans that are size 32 waist  and i wear a size 8 or 10 this brace is a large and a medium would have been to tight for ushope this helps
love love love this mask  all my previous sleep masks have had the classic velcro band that goes around your head well i just must have some abnormally large head because after about a month the band would stretch out so i would tighten it and it would stretch again eventually i would get to the last small piece of velcro that could still hold on however this created another problem the rest of the velcro would then get tangled in my hair not with this mask someone finally had the great idea to use adjustable ear loops instead i am so happy  this mask also has a smooth silky cool side and a warm side the only think i would change would be to  raise the material where the eyes are i dont like having the material press down on my eyes however i will deal with it because the good outweigh that small inconvenience love it
love the idea of compostable garbage bags i ordered these for our home for general use mostly in our kitchen garbage unfortunately these are useless because they have a defective thinning line going through middle that makes them tear even if something very light is inside of them otherwise could be a good bag but this specific batch of garbage bags i received are garbage
they serve the purpose my 85 year old mother in law couldnt unzip them honestly snack bags ftom the grocery store are just as good and cheaper
brilliant idea works perfectly the stickers on two of the boxes were incorrect customer service offered a new set fantastic service a must buy for tablet takers everywhere
definitely recommend    absolutely a must have for sore muscles
im giving this product three stars primarily due to the fact it is a knee scooter and the pad where you put your knee is not very much padding at all in fact its a willful attempted being a good pad and the covering that covers that is even worse with very little use my wife having had foot surgery the pad felt inadequate to begin and degrades very rapidly and the fake leather whatever the covering is on it is made of is like starting to crack and maybe as durable as a wet paper towel maybethats the bad stuff now the good stuff is in terms of mobility and functionality this thing offers quick release adjustment on the handlebars which is far far superior to most of the other brands which you have to take the pin all the way out unscrew it all the way take it all the way out adjust the handlebars and then you have to store it somewhere not very mobile in my opinion so this ones light years ahead of all of those  overall i have to say compared to what else is on the market this thing is a pretty good value for the money but it still leaves a lot to be desired having said that it is the one that we finally purchased similar to how we vote in the united states sadly we had to choose between the better piece of garbage
it doesnt do diddly squat the rasp is great  it has a coarse grind and a fine grind and it will do the job instead the nail brush is like any other it cleans your nails easily
still too big to swallow  id rather take two small pills than gag on one  why cant anyone come up with a fish pill us humans dont have to risk choking to death to swallow 
i bought these because the bristles were charcoal and the rest of the toothbrush is bamboo  i liked that there was no plastic  the feel of the toothbrush is different but it works so well  my teeth felt cleaner  i loved it so much i bought another pack
before i had my daughter i went out on a limb and bought this as an in case for diaper blow outs and spit up stains i couldnt be happier it works really well i have found that sometimes i need to spray and soak for an hour or so and then do it again if needed if it doesnt come out after the first wash i end up filling my sink with hot hot water and dumping a little bit into the sink and letting it soak over night if its a really bad stain and it comes right out after that next wash my daughter just started solids which is a completely different stain than spit up and diaper blow outs but this stain remover works just as well
all around nice product good amount for the price i use in in skincare so i cant comment on taste i will buy this again
it gets hotwarm provides temporary soothing
perfect box for oils they fit perfectly
this is a great shaver  it gives me the closest shave ive ever had  im able to shave my head in the shower and it does a fantastic job its very easy to clean too although the first time it was a bit difficult to open up the heads  the instructions could be better and the pictures are a bit smallnote  to remove middle head turn counterclockwise just about 18 and then pull straight out
easy to  use
works well we have a european dishwasher that requires power not as good as the high end powder
ive had contacts for 20 years and always took good care of them at annual visits the doctor would always comment that he couldnt believe my 2 week soft contacts were over 4 weeks old they were so clean and looked great under the scope so when my new doctor recommended this due to my eyes battling dry eye and irritation from long dustydirty work days i figured id try it but wasnt expecting muchi am a vet and my eyes are bombarded with hair fuzz dust nail dust from the dremel and all kinds of things and my contacts are in from 6 am to after 10 at night most days i have to take out and rinse one at least once some days they just feel like something is stuck on them alllllll day  this treatment does seem to freshen them a bit nothing miraculous since i keep mine very clean but i use it weekly or as a last resort if one contact is really bugging me to see if its salvageable or ready to toss the peroxide is strong if you have a cut rash ezcema or something and you get some on your hand it will burn i rinse like crazy before i put them back in my eyes this one expires in under a year so i dont know if ill use it up with mostly weekly uses
my husband was tired of using tennis balls for his walker so he decided to try this option  the socks that go vet them for inside use ripped almost immediately  without the socks they scraped my wood floors  we ended up throwing them away
horribleleft my hair too puffy
i use this product for gut health
these gummies arent soft at all  they are hard and stick to the teeth  the flavor is good and the fiber is good but just much to hard
