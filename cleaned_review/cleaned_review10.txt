ive always had great luck with radha products  you definitely get what you pay for and in this case it is a quality product  this is excellent for cleaningi use it directly on wood and add it to a vinegarwater solution to mop my floors very nice clean scent
no complaints about these replacement brush heads the bristles are a medium soft  a bit harder than the braun ultra soft but not as firm as the regular heads although i prefer an ultra soft bristle these have not irritated my gums even though they are a bit firmer than i normally usethey fit fine on my oral b without needing to force them on or have them be too loose the fit is as good as the oral b headsthese are packaged very well each brush is individually sealed in a plastic wrapper plus it has a plastic cap to keep the bristles from deforming while they are in storage the set of 8 come in a cardboard box its a much better way of packaging them than the usual blister packs for both ease of use as well as protectionkeeping them sanitary while they are in storage for useall in all a good alternative to the brand name brushes
this toddler bedfootresthammock is a game changer  you can tell the design was thoroughly thought out  it is easy to setup so that you are not interrupting the passenger in front  the material is lightweight and durable  its easy to store and small enough to place in your carryon  it even has a bottle holder and a nonslip backget one

i have plantar fasciitis and it is very painful  i hoped these insoles would give me some relief but they did not  i tried to use several time and alternate with my original shoe inserts but didnt help at all  thanks
i have only had this product for 4 daysafter using it for 2 days i had great relief from my allergies  on the 3rd day i woke up with my combo migraine allergy headache that i get from junipers this time of year  because of this inhaler i was able to function  get out of bed  i would have normally had to stay on ice  flat in bed because i could not function with that painthis was  is the only thing that has ever stopped that pain from continuing  it stopped it dead  i am amazedtry it
when its working right wow but tends to cut in and out with movement
i love my dogs however one of them had a habit of ripping out the insoles of my shoes when he was a puppythese insoles are nice and soft and are certainly an upgrade from the insoles that were torn up theres just enough cushioning they arent going to crowd or cramp your feet on days when you arent wearing socks they feel so comfortable against your bare skina little bit of luxury for your feet
i love beets ill take them any which way they are available including powdered this powder tastes like fresh beets in powdered form i buy beet powder a couple times a year and my experience with this so far is that it seems to be of great quality easy to add to anything while i normally do smoothies i am inclined to start adding it to batters and soups what a great addition to muffins pancakes and breads if you are into sipping broths and you happen to like the taste of beets it is nice stirred into a mug of hot homemade broth mmmit does impart a beet taste and it does turn everything pinkred
wow love this little battery powered lighter  my candles get lit easily handy little item

these liners are best if your boots do not have fur inside otherwise they will not fit inside without bunching they keep the cold out very well

this works very well for my mom
love love this product
i sometimes get a stiff neck and my neck always hurts a bit to tilt back from some whiplash i got i thought this would feel good on my neck but it kinda just feels like its sharply jabbing into my neck maybe i need to do it more easy to use and well made need to give it more time to see if it makes a difference
we have a cat who needs to take half of a very tiny pill twice a day this worked great to split the pills in half

pricey but pretty work nicely
this product smelled so bad i kept it in the original box  put it in the garage  no way would i use this product
they worked just fine  now to get the broken underground wires fixed

i drank this yesterday as directed on the side of the container and i seemed to have more energy than i thought i would at my evening tennis practice  i had worked out pretty hard using the tennis ball machine earlier that day and was kind of dragging before tennis practice time  i drank a full 8 oz of water with one scoopful of gen one nutritionintramino intraworkout bcaa amino acids powder and i really did feel pretty good and played well at practice  i wasnt even very tired when i got home and our coach had us doing conditioning drills  the flavor was sort of coconutlike and sweet  i wish it was not so sweet but it seems that most of these type powders just load up on sweetness  it dissolved well in water and i didnt see any clumps  i like this but will have to add some lemon juice to it next time to tone down the sweet
this is a great scrub brush i have always wanted to try one of these out and i like it for the most part  i did think that the brush spun on this but i almost think its for the better that it doesnt because i think it would be a little too harsh if it did spin  this facial brush vibrates at different speeds while you scrub your face  it comes with two different brushes one is a typical soft brush and the other is a very soft sponge  i really like to use both heads on this  it does come with a separate base so your face brush can stand up wherever you store it which is convenient  i really like the green color of this item too it matches many other things i have  there is one button which turns the device on and off and also turns the speeds up or down  the brush heads are very easy to remove and replace even if you are someone who has painful hands  i really enjoy this product i received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
this seems like a revolution or complete reinvention of electric razors for women  of course it is telling my age to say that my first one was used in the 1960s but boy razors have come a long way this one can be used as soon as it arrives before you even finish charging it because the charger cord is long enough to permit flexibility of use while charging  it comes with a type c power cable but you will need your own type c charger which i fortunately already have several of the shaving head easily follows the curves of my legs the body of the charger is longer sleeker and much advanced ergonomicallyspeaking than the short squareshaped ones of my past there is a cleaning brush and a carrying case  i am totally satisfied
love this product
this is a very solid and large pin steel shafts are thick enough to not bend too easily but that does make it harder to work in through thicker cloth material
yum this tastes so good in your coffee mixed with a hint of chocolate just like an almond joy candy bar i only docked 1 star because its a bit pricey for such a small bag tastes good though
this supplement has ingredients that are known to help joint health  chondrointin glucosamine sulfate msm and i was glad to see turmeric added  im a big fan of turmeric and use it mostly for maintaining my joint health by making what is called golden paste  extremely good for health  i think this is a good supplement but it will take time and patience before noticing any improvement  if you want fast improvement google golden paste make it and take it as directed
love this product it was inexpensive and was delivered quickly i love all the cute patterns on the wrap worked well for my dogs foot i love that you get two different sizes as well great product

i started wearing sleeping masks to bed a few years ago they really help when my husband stays up and watches tv or in the summer when the sun rises so early these are light weight and very soft theyre adjustable so you can get a perfect fit the block most of the light i have found that a little light still comes in around the sides they are comfortable to wear during sleep i tend to forget to bring one with me when traveling so im putting one of these in the pocket of my small suitcase so i have it with me
did not purchase from amazon but got for christmas as soon as i put batteries in and turned it on the batteries exploded it seems very dangerous
love this stuff smells better than aqua reef and just like all of the other old spice gel deodorants it goes on smooth and lasts all day long recommend this to anyone who wants to smell great
gimmick product save your money get a classic eyelash curler instead it will do much more
a good bath brush the handle is nice and long snd well built but a little heavy which makes it sturdier
my wife loves it finally a place to put all her oils in and keep them organized

love their unflavored peptides but this cucumber aloe flavor is absolutely disgusting
biggest issue i had with these besides having to replace filters was the very poor fit around my nose no matter what i tried i constantly fogged up my glasses which was a huge pain
we have been trying to eat a whole food plant based diet  part of this effort means finding ways to consume more vegetables in regular food we also try to eat the rainbow increasing the different types and colors of producewhile we use mostly fresh and frozen vegetables this spinach powder is easy to add to sauces soups even baked goods i have just started using it but it has a mild flavor that adds to tomato sauce it is very convenient
this daily shower cleaner is fantastic and hard to find i have been using it for years and was thrilled i was able to order it online it works great and was even recommended by the guy who came out to fix my shower
if you have a need for vegetable glycerin this is a great product wonderful packaging and a very reasonable price ive purchased a few different essential depot products and ive never been disappointed
i really enjoy creating my own custom essential oil blends black pepper is a new discovery for me it has a warm and spicy scent that adds an extra kick of something exotic to your blends it pairs well with woody scents like pine cypress and cedarwood its also nice with citrus notes like neroli and bergamot its ideal to use in rooms where you want to feel relaxed surprisingly it can help you sleep better overall this is a good buy i highly recommend itthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided helps make your decision a little easier
i have some sun damage on my face and i was hoping this would help fade that since that is a feature but after a few weeks i dont see any change the pads and serum feel really nice on my face but there was no coloration change to my complexion
very nice album i will have to chose some very special photographs to insert 
no problems with the order  it was shipped quickly
these gloves are excellent they work well the gloves have granules in the palm and fingers that help to cause friction which leads to a better grip all i know is that these gloves hold on to things like those pesky dishes much better than some others ive used in the past these are latex free waterproof and go up a good distance on the arm to help keep you dryclean and the waterdirtetc out this pack is very good because the gloves come in different colors so you can use them in different rooms without confusing say the bathroom and kitchen gloves i love these
nice quality thick soft without perfume
the color variety is stunning
good fit be sure to use soap and wash the nose oil off before a swim so they dont slide off while swimming
this product has a lot of b vitamins and caffeine that will surely keep you awake if you have one of those days where you really need to be awake at night this most definitely will be beneficial and after taking if you feel a heated flush on your face that is from the niacinamide and is a normal side effect and goes away in minutes
i was given a second hand wood table with character marks like 40 years ago the marks were not bothersome as it gave character what i could not stand were the hideous white heat or water rings that were created the last 5 years i figured this product could not make it uglier and gave it a try after viewing videos and reading other reviews applying the product was easy i went with the grain and wiped it off the white marks took lite elbow grease and these magically disappeared some of the character marks are gone also almost looks new there wasnt much of a smell which i was happy about since i dont have much ventaliation living in an old city apartment with few windows i am soooo pleased with the product that i might do my desk that i purchased in a second hand shop 40 years ago for the price i suggest to try this first before considering going to furniture restorer
125 mcg equals 5000 iu which is about what i take on a daily basis more or less  these vitamin d3 pills are very small and easy to swallow  d3 is fat soluble and should stay in your system longer  i think one small capsuleday is plenty at least for me  the bottle is too big for the quantity because it looks like the bottle is nearly empty but it contains 60 little vitamin d3 pills  the vitamin d3 is in coconut oil
sorry to give this only a 2 star review but my biggest issue is the steam the steam button is supposed to be automatically pressed when the 2 plates touch but i tried several times  with several settings and no stream is coming out the steam was the main reason i bought this but now its just a regular iron if you work for this company please let me know what to do to get the steam out automatically this is not convenient at all and im very disappointed
i generally work from home and my kids are homeschooled so the number of germs we bring into our household are generally minimal recently there were a number of flus and colds going around that i really didnt want to catch so every time i would go out to meet with people or go grocery shopping i would use the travel protocol for this which is to say i would take a few in succession to really amp up my natural immune system defenses in my throat salivary glands etcwhile its hard to say for sure what works and what doesnt when it comes to probiotics this gave me no bad side effects and i do feel the research is clear that it does help prevent illness i appreciate having the option of adding this to my line up of wellness supplements i had been taking another brand of oral probiotic but when i realized that this was the brand that actually invented this type of oral probiotic i switched over to taking this since i trust that the strain is pure
previously i used elderberry capsules but wanted to try a syrup and it was time to restock for this winter so i bought this product because it was organic this tasted really good not sweet or overpowering but good so im looking forward to the winter knowing that i have this on my shelf
these are very nice lots of capacity and such a pretty color
i have been using this product for quite a while  just a bulk purchase versus small packets of similar if not the same  close enough for my use
i have sensitive skin and use this to spot treat dry areas during colder months i apply all over face and neck before bed and my skin looks amazing in the morning
it works ok the onoff and temp buttons are in a bad place on the handle    i keep pressing them by accident  my hair is medium length  the curling action would work better on longer hair
my son absolutely loves them  they arrived two days ago and he couldnt be happier  they are very realistic looking and his father from a short distance actually thought he had been scratched by some kittens we are fostering  my son loved fooling his father  i bought these through a promotional event but the price was not discounted it was available to everyone who purchased them on that date  i am so happy i took advantage of the opportunity  i purchased four sets and my son cant wait to use them for halloween
speaking for myself product failed to produce any increase in alkaline when i tested daily i actually lost or had lower levels after using this product had better levels using sparking mineral waters italian  german purchased at trader joes
great for those bitterly cold nights when cold feet wont allow you to fall asleep  runs a little tight  it does its job  dont try to walk in it
maybe for small bust but not for full size tape came off not sturdy durable and not wide enough just a big roll of bandaid tape
stopped working after half of one use
i found these bamboo makeup remover reusable pads to be a good concept  it has a large surface area 3 inches diameter for applying makeup remover facial lotion etc  i found that i can soak it with cold water and place each one over my eyes  it fits exactly over each eye  it is a nice relaxing treatment for my tired eyes  the material is very soft but not as absorbent as i wanted  there are two sides a white and black side  i found the black side to be more absorbenti gave it one fewer star because1 because of its size its hard to apply around the eyes2 it is recommended to wash the 16 pads in the provided mesh bag in cold water and then to dry on a towel  it took a few hours to dry them  i will put them in a dryer from now on  it is made of 70 bamboo and 30 cotton so it shouldnt shrink too muchit comes with a nice bamboo holder that looks minimalistic on my bathroom counter  this product is a nice way to avoid using endless cotton pads which can reduce waste and help with expense
it quit working after only 3 times light will not come on suggestion dont purchase this product
this is a great eye maski thought that the ear muffs did a good job at cutting out the noise while i was sleeping it wasnt loud noise  just the sound of my humidifier in my bedroommy problem with these is that im a side sleeper i felt like the donut smashed my eari dont have the largest earsi think with some adjusting these could be more comfortablethe outside of the ear muffs are a very soft silicone which i likei like how these didnt move around or fall off while i was sleepingi think i will keep these for my travel eye mask for when im on an airplane or trainit will be nice to be able to not have to worry about messing with the small ear plugs in those placesthe eye mask does a good job at keeping it black and its very comfortable
how come every time you find a cleaning product you really like when you go back to buy it again it becomes a mission  this is one such product  many years ago i discovered the saving that could be had buying bulkconcentrated cleaning products  from orange cleaner to murphys oil soap the saving is staggering so when this product first came out i jumped on it  and have been using it ever since  thankfully i had bout an additional bottle to see which scent i preferred way back when because now this product isnt at walmart kroger lowes etc in our area  thankfully amazon is there to deliver the items that cannot be foundwho knows what lengths i will have to go to in a few years but that is tomorrows problemgreat cleaner fresh scent  i usually have a double strength bottle and a regular bottle  the cleaner is very good and takes most of the work out of it after it soaks in
i take lisine for two different reasons the lysine you consume can help your gastrointestinal tract absorb calcium and reduce how much of this mineral is excreted into your urinebecause your body cant manufacture lysine you must include it in the foods you eat or in supplement this llysine is a really good supplement i am very pleased with the results i am getting from the bronson llysine
meh doesnt do much straightening
i gave it five stars because it works as it should my wife would only give it one star though because it works as it should lol good metal construction not cheap or flimsy
cannot say enough about these  lightweight large size convenient neck strap durablewashable  i wear them every day and own several  other staff have asked me where i got them teacher
i have always chewed garlic when i feel like i am about to get sick because it has immuneboosting properties however it is not practical to keep garlic cloves in my bag this product works great because it has the same effect of boosting my immune system but it stays fresh for a long time and is easy to take i dont notice any bad taste or after effects i would recommend this to anyone
i have a rental property that has white tile with white grout  needless to say the grout was pretty awful  sprayed this on and let it sit for a few minutes wiped it off with an old towel  will be stocking up
came in a bubble envelope and were busted up smelled good though
this thing  broke its cheaply made
great product and quick delivery
its taffylike  the flavor is just okay for me  i prefer their espresso bar which has to be heated
we love the new scale  it post our weight each day onto our fitbit app the scale is helping us live a healthier life style
i bought one of these and another smaller as i just have had a knee replacement icing is crucial to help healing and pain and the large ace is really great i bought 2 extra 3 days later and just now ordered another to have spares for the rest of my phys therapy durationi like the fact that you can put them right on the skin they do stay pliable after freezing and the size is great for the area on the knee i have used them for 2 12 weeks now and had no problems with leakagethey freeze really fast  within 30 to 45 min and last for up to 30 minutes just perfect for what i needthese will also be nice to have on hand for other aches and pains as they crop up after im done with my rehab for my knee replacementfor this they are perfect
ive purchased pillowpaws skid resistant socks before in xxl grey and was very pleasedi decided to order a smaller size for my grandson but they didnt offer them in greyi was disappointed in the quality of this order though they are still comfyi wear the 3 pair of irregular sizes and gave him the better 3 pairsi wont order from this vendor again
overall this is a pretty good white noise machine its very compact which is a plus since i dont have a lot of bedside table area available this has a smaller footprint than my last white noise machine making it also a handy item if you want to take it while travelingsetup is simple and theres a good selection of sounds to choose from i stick with the white noise but its nice to have options just to experiment with them to see which work the best the variety also makes this useful not only for adults but for infantschildren to help them sleep the sound volume has a good range and the light feature is also a nice touch even though its not something i get much use out ofthe main con is the control panel its hard to see which control is which especially in dim light i would prefer a more traditional button system with nice clear text labels as to function or better yet some type of simple remote where the buttons light up granted that would increase the price but the layout presently used can be really frustrating to useone star down for the control system but otherwise a very nice compact sound machine
this step does not work for me it slides all over and i have nearly fallen several times  i tried to put tape on the bottom but its still slick
i use it for everything indestructible
these protein powders come in such great flavors and they provide the highest amount of protein with little to no carbs andor sugar  i have been buying these for years and love them
not good for my homemade cosmetics  compared to other organic grapeseed oils this one is deep yellowish green in color with a very pungent almost sour smell i had previously been using a different grapeseed oil that was near odorless and had only a very faint pale yellow color
hemp is a wonderful weed that can be made into just about anything this is a superior product
i love this product its the best but the small size is not well sealed and arrived dry
weve soldiered through about half a bottle of these horrid vitamins over the course of several months  taking them only when were out of our usual vitamins flintstones and im now throwing them away after my kids complained about the aftertaste i tried one and they truly are horrid dont waste your money
hard to get item these days and i dont waste it on my dishwasherone of those things 34not sold in costco anymore34when i open a box i immediately pour it into a salvaged heinz ketchup bottles and dispense it from there  it is my first line of defense in cleaning the glass jar on my blendersjust open the recycled bottle flip top and squirt some in on top of hot water and blend awayrinse and walk away knowing this stuff did a terrific job
i thought these were an amazing idea but awful in practice theyre a mess to use stuff splatters when you start to get to a high enough speed to actually clean something i have better luck with a handheld cleaning brush
excellent callous remover  does not hurt foot and s rapes off stubborn hard skin on heels
this is the best in the market just wish it were closer to us instead of further away  customer service is excellent they are very responsive and easy to talk to  without this product i would have lots of aches and pain  this also works really well if you have stomach problems because of the ginger used in it rather than black pepper  pineapple is another thing used for absorption of turmeric but nothing compares to ginger  i reduced my stomach medicine by half using this turmeric  buy with confidence
bought some nice designer frames that look great but dont always stay on my small nose  i thought this would be the solution given all the hype over it  but after i ordered this i started the waiting game  i received delays notices then was given the option to cancel because it was going to take so long to receivei decided to cancel but the product has stayed in my queue as if i am still waiting for it  ill be checking my account to see if i was actually charged for this  grrrri would love the chance to try it so if youre listening nerdwax please send this  finally
as a vaper i find myself having to change my coils at the worst possible times usually halfway through a full tank for me these blunt tipped syringes are a perfect way to drain out a tank of vape juice before removing the coil without having to waste any juice i cant speak of other uses for them but they do what theyre supposed to they suck up liquid and they shoot it back out what more could you ask for
works great  exactly as shown
i like that these dont dissolve with essential oils in them
it fits on top of our round toilet seat  it works like the sitz bath tub i brought home from the hospital years ago i add salts to help relieve hemorrhoid pains
maybe my skin is too dry or too sensitive because i just didnt experience many positive results from 100 pures cocoa bean facial scrub the scrub is contained in a tube with a screw onoff lid  reminds me of toothpaste as it is fairly thick and dispenses rather firm does not lather contains small cacao nibs for exfoliation has a pleasant chocolate scent that is not long lasting  the scrub is supposed to exfoliate polish away bumps flakes and dull spots calm redness promote a balanced tone and make skin glow  the only result i experienced was soft skin  and i do mean soft  but there was no glow to my skin the red patches dryness  eczema didnt go away and dull spots remained softening my skin was a nice benefit but not enough to warrant continued use of the scrub i have no plans to purchase use this in the future
this stuff is getting harder to find  please dont stop carrying it otherwise my hair will suck look ugly and well  its the best thing i got going for me anymore
these make properly worn do not even block simple dust or daily allergens they will be of not be useful for prevention of airborn transmitted infectioni am a former rn specialist i bought these cheaper masks for use in my home for brief socially distanced encounters to give to ppl at my door etc however in testing these with regular house dust they failed 3 consecutive times because i know the proper correct way to use a disposable face mask i believe i can say with personal certainty they are substantially ineffective at blocking smaller particles suck as virus however if this is all you can afford i suggest you buy another similar product in this price range  supplement it with secondary face mask pathogen barriers as found on credible internet sites that will be helpful bc blocking virus that causes covid19 is essential
i milk one nigerian dwarf goat and i think this will last her entire lactation other goat owners recommended it and im happy with it knowing it keeps her healthy
callous remover works well but epilator doesnt work
they would probably work for other shoes but the pin was too thick for the shoes i needed fixed

so far so good it doesnt smell like anything and i seem to be consistently picking up grime on the towel every time i wipe it down so it seems to be working i do feel like i need more than 3 sprays to clean the mat though
it is almost impossible to push the plunger i thought it was one can so ordered a couple more the same thing how in the world can a company sell something like this gold bond i mean not amazon and yes i twisted the cap and had other people try it
worth the money  get it  so much more comfortable than cottonfleecememory foam cushions  wow

still trying to figure out not much curl but could be my fault
these are so tiny you can do absolutely nothing with them so garish they look tacky
great for screen cleaning
a must for banana split parties good quality materials 3 generations enjoyed the extra special party boats our grands hand washed them to reuse again the umbrellas were recycled to their doll house 
cool product to have in the california area makes my friends jealous
i like the fact that there is a variety of temperatures  it smoothed my hair out very quickly  it is small so it isnt heavy and bulky  and it is easy to use with either hand
if you read a lot and your eyes get bloodshot these eye drops really help i notice that a few drops in each eye gets the red out in a matter of minutes i dont use these a lot just occasionally when i read too much the warning on the back says too much use can have the opposite effect so it is advised you use this product sparingly and only when needed please see your doctor if redness continues or if you have eye painthe rebecca review
this is one of the rare color sets that has base matte top and glossy top coats the colors are pretty much ygwys  you get what you see in other wordsthe base coat does have a hint of pine scent to it but the top coat doesnt speaking of smell these are low odorduration because my nails grow out so quickly  i am changing my manicure every 710 days so i can say they last at least that long if done properlyyou will need an leduv lamp to cure it
i love this cold roller i can get a massage effect while also getting localized cold to any areas that hurt mainly i have been using it for my hands to relieve carpal tunnel pain
great stuff  i can tell a difference in several bodily ways will not elaborate but this change is more than in anything else i have ever taken  i am 71 yrs of age and one thing i will elaborate on my recall memory is better  and it cant be coincidence its been bad for so long and now after taking several containers of this i can tell a sizable difference  now i dont take it but only about 4 times a week and only 1 large scoop full  as per my weight and directions i should be taking about 2 scoops for a dosage  i always tend to think they suggest dosage as max and i am not inclined to maximize dosage thus i take one large scoop when i take it  which makes it go further and i still get resultsthank you amazon for allowing this price to be affordable  its about at the top of my priceline and am grateful for that
i live in florida where hard water is definitely an issue i just purchased my house last september and recently retired and i am trying to be careful on spending money many of my neighbors have been installing whole house water systems and although i do think at sometime in the future i will look into it this filter has helped me at least in the shower i can tell the water is better since i installed it yes installation was super easy for me and my hair feels so much softer and i see less spots on the shower glass doors for the money this is a great shower filter and i highly recommend it
not bad considering i didnt wait the 30 minutes before drinking something it does a good job it foams ever so slightly and the foam really seems to stick to any discoloration slight sensitivity but just use a sensitive toothpaste lot of product in each of the pens easy to use nice that the pens are clear so you know how much product is left havent used for but it would be convenient for travel too
got these for my dogs and horses much cheaper than buying individual supplements i use gram scoops for their servings
this is a great 3pack of reading glasses  i love that they come protective fabric cases a neoprenetype material as these are much more compact for storagetravel than bulky hard cases  i also love that the frames are fullsized so they work well for activities such as using a computer screeni am wearing a pair for this purpose right now  the frames are also thin and lightweight but they are attractive in a simple way  they set includes three different translucent frame colors  allinall i am very happy with these and definitely would recommend
perfect for trauma nursing
the padding is comfortable almost like sitting on firm jelly very different from memory foam type pads good for desk work would be too high for car seats though well see about durability as i wonder how long the viscoelastic material will hold up
somewhat disappointing the head is quite small and not particularly full or fluffy there is no way to remove the head to wash it and put it back on the instrument at some point i will have to hand wash just the head in the sink i guess very inconvenient i would have expected a higher quality product at this price point i will turn to a janitorial supply resource
ive been trying to accumulate as many elderberry products as i can because it is such a powerful antiviral and will get to the core of a cold or flu real fast and knock it out  when this elderberry powder came up on my list of items i could review i had to try it  i mixed a spoonful up in about 4 ounces of cold water and stirred until it was mostly in solution  i tasted it and was glad it wasnt bitter  it tasted pretty much like nothing  i added a little honey to it and it was very easy to drink down  the bag says one serving is 2g of elderberry powder but says nothing about any other ingredients such as vitamins  all that information is on the product page  i think this is a good product and will keep it on hand come this winter season to use to ward off cold and flu viruses
not completely sure it works but i leave it plugged in my kitchen going 247 looks nice and has an ambient light
astragalus root is an adaptogen used in traditional chinese medicine it is reputed to help the immune  and cardiovascular systems as well as being a powerful antiinflammatory this powder comes in a small resealable pouch the powder is clean vegan gluten and gmo free it has a distinctive earthy flavor that is easily masked by combining wth smoothies juice or other foods while i cant point to any specific benefit i generally feel better when i am taking it than when i am not i have not experienced any negative side effects but if you are taking any medication especially immunosuppressants or lithium consult your physician i am satisfied with this product seems pure and blends well
bought three of these for our flight to italy they worked great and didnt take up too much space in our carryons and were easy to blow up i did however get extra screening at security and they blamed it on the folded up footrest even though the people i was traveling with also had them and didnt get called out so who knows
i know how expensive this fish oil is but its very worth it if the multitude of studies about the benefits of fish oil can be believedi was wary of the pure oil even though i was happy to not have all the fillers included in the capsules because of the taste  i am happy to report that the oil has no fishy taste and i have not gotten any fish burps unlike with the capsules  it is oily which is a weird texture on the tongue but the taste is pure orange  i like eating it with a mouthful of leafy greens to dissipate the oil feel
im grateful for these framar nitrile gloves because its critical that i protect my hands and especially my fingers at this stage years of cleaning have made them sensitive to even mild dish soap so i consider these powder free no latex gloves a godsend theyre easy to put on and easy off tough against chemicals strong and they dont bother my skin size m is a great fit allowing me to do tactile tasks with ease protection from dish soap cleaning solvents oils dyes paints turpentine garden chemicals soil and more  9 framar gloves are perfect for my needs
love them  great price for the product

i play a lot of competitive tennis  i had a grueling match last weekend and was fatigued when it was over and i was finally back home  i drank about 14 a bottle of the vital performance recovery drink and put the rest in the refrigerator  its a week later and the bottle is still there untouched  i felt better after drinking the amount i drank but it doesnt taste very good  i think i will take the remainder bottle with me to my next match and drink it during the match and see if it helps me keep my energy level up  i like the idea of recovery drinks but i need something more palatable

i collect rubber ducks a good friend jokingly suggested i get thispros1 its a duckcons1 its not waterproof the compartment for the batteries is not sealable entirely so word of caution if you want to go 34ahoy34 in a tub with it2 the vibration frequency is not the best for this sort of toy yes it might get the job done but honestly for the price get a waterpoof pocket vibe like a wevibe3 its really hard plastic it claims to be bodysafe but honestly the plastic on this thing is very sturdyso if you want a cute collectible that might start some interesting guestvisit conversations get it if you want an actual vibrating bathtoy look else where

i purchased this to use in a recipe for my skincare on my face i would recommend this to friends and family for a great glycerin producti will repurchase this in the future
if you are going out and sweating or working you add the liquid to your water and this will help replenish electrolyte drops if you have issues with leg cramps this can help with that too
these discs leave a residue in the toilet as it sheds the outer layer
very classylooking and versatile
seems like a good size pill  i dont think it would be too hard to swallow and it does appear smaller than other vitamin pills ive seen beforebenefits should be reviewed with your doctor and you should check with them to make sure that these are going to benefit youoverall i think these are nice hopefully theyre beneficial to you
the main cold fighting ingredient in this is echinacea which for some people has been shown to help fight colds ive taken it in the past in pill format with mixed results  sometimes it seems to help other times not so muchthis is another way to get your echinacea along with other herbs the ingredients areechinacea purpuera herbred rootgreen tea leafelderberry fruitthyme herbred clover herbmyrrh gumits in a base of vegetable glycerin and water which gives it a syrupy consistency on the plus side that can help soothe your throat on the downside the taste to me was only semiappealing its not bad or medicinal tasting just odd  sort of a semispicy taste that lingers on your tonguethe dosage is 1ml 25 drops 1 to 2 times per day i like that it comes in a glass bottle with a good quality dropper rather than plastic however the country of manufacture is not listed nor is the concentration of the various herbs in iti cant give it a strong recommendation since the taste is so unusual its one of those items that youre either going to find tasty or really dislike but i found the taste odd but interesting so ill give it 35 stars rounded up to 4 since it did soothe my throatworth a try but as with any herbal remedy dont expect your cold symptoms to magically disappearsample provided for review
it was nice that they threw in a gift of a full sized bottle of another product as well
my daughter got alot of utis until we found this stuff when youre on swim team or teach swimmingthis is great to have

the picture on this is currently a safety belt it has nothing to do with these gel padsi wear cpap full face mask somehow it rubbed a pressure ulcer in the bridge of my nose it was painful and horrible i ordered these put them together to make them thick i would put antibacterial gel on it cover it with a bandaid add the gel pads and put my mask on these were life savers the ulcer has healed hopefully putting vitamin e on it will help reduce scarring and i feel much better about everything i would not be without these againever

i tend to get sinus headaches when i take allergy and decongest medications to clear up my sinuses they get dry tender and this helps to moisturize that nose i use a cpap at night and that also tends to be drying especially during the winter i dont like using the water the humidify my sinuses and this gives me a good start
hands down hubbys new favorite protein powder he has been on the search ever since having to go off whey protein for something that didnt taste horrible vegan protein powders can be pretty rough taste and texture wise but he really liked this one it dissolved well and the only downside would be the price
except for fitbit ionic we found all other fitbit products provides great convenience tracking our daily activities and fitness goals this smart scale tracks up to 10 individual persons using artificial intelligence  the price is a little above other good scales but the smartness and convenience of fitbit aria are well worth the investment
um i am sure for some people these are great they are not useful to me because they dont offer enough of a cushion to make a difference
i have read that tart cherries can help with insomnia  im not a juice drinker so i was excited to try these capsules  after taking almost the whole bottle i can say they unfortunately havent helped me sleep at allfrom what other reviewers have to say they are probably great quality for other purposes  but for me they didnt help with the issue i am having so i wouldnt recommend them to help you sleep
bought these generic cleaning cartridges for the price but will continue to buy them over the brand name items as they work just as well
husband was skeptical at first but likes it
this is an excellent product with great health benefits here is what it does if you are unfamiliar with ithow forskolin worksforskolin acts primarily by activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase which results in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp in cells cyclic amp belongs to a class of substances known as 34second messengers34 and is one of the most important cellregulating compounds among its many roles camp activates numerous other enzymes involved in diverse cellular functions hormones and neurotransmitters also activate adenylate cyclase but forskolin appears to be able to activate adenylate cyclase by itself thus forskolin can increase cyclic amp without the assistance of hormones or neurotransmitterseffects of cyclic amppincreased cellular cyclic amp results in a broad range of physiological and biochemical effects including inhibition of platelet activation resulting in decreased likelihood of blood clots reduced release of histamine resulting in decreased allergy symptoms increased force of contraction of the heart relaxation of the arteries and other smooth muscles increased thyroid function and increased lipolysis fat burninga number of diseases are characterized in part by decreased intracellular levels of cyclic amp these include asthma eczema psoriasis angina obesity and hypertension in addition to its adenylyl cyclasestimulating actions forskolin also appears to have actions that are not due to this mechanism but are due to its ability to alter a number of membrane transport proteinsasthma and allergiesmany drugs used to treat asthma and allergies are designed to increase camp levels usually they inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase that breaks down camp this mechanism is the 34flip side34 of forskolins ability to act directly to increase camp thus forskolin can be used by itself or in addition to phosphodiesteraseinhibiting drugs in the prevention and treatment of many allergic conditions including asthmaforskolin is an effective smoothmuscle relaxer resulting in bronchodilation decreased airway resistance and increased vital capacity and forced expiratory volume which are important indicators of pulmonary function forskolin also has tremendous antispasmodic action on various smooth muscles in the body making it useful to relieve intestinal colic uterine cramps painful urination angina and hypertensioncardiovascular effects of forskolincoleus forskohli has traditionally been used to treat hypertension congestive heart failure and angina treating these conditions may be among the most useful uses for forskolin forskolins basic cardiovascular action is to lower blood pressure while simultaneously increasing the contractility of the heart this is believed to be due to forskolins campelevating ability which results in relaxation of the arteries and increased force of contraction of the heart muscle one study involved seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy a particularly difficult condition to treat forskolin administration dramatically improved left ventricular function and overall cardiovascular performanceforskolin also increases cerebral blood flow indicating that it may be beneficial in cerebral vascular insufficiency and in enhancing poststroke recovery the platelet aggregationinhibiting effects of forskolin also add to its value in cardiovascular disordersglaucoma and increased intraocular pressureglaucoma is a cause of visual loss characterized by nerve damage usually associated with increased intraocular pressure loss of visual field glare and sometimes pain it is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly unfortunately there is very little in the armamentarium of alternative health care practitioners that is effective in preventing or treating this poorly understood condition however a number of studies have shown that topical application of one percent forskolin eye drops resulted in significant decreases in intraocular pressure for up to five hours researchers believe that it is the campelevating effects of forskolin that result in this significant improvement unfortunately no commercial forskolin eye drops have been developed at this time although clinical experience is limited oral forskolin appears to offer significant potential for sufferers of glaucoma or intraocular hypertension and may be a major advance in the nondrug treatment of this conditionpsoriasispsoriasis is characterized by a relative decrease in camp compared to another second messenger cyclic guanine monophosphate cgmp this imbalance results in a tremendous increase in cell division in psoriasis cells divide about 1000 times faster than normal forskolin helps to alleviate psoriasis by normalizing the camp cgmp ratio it should be noted that fumaric acid by itself is highly effective in the prevention and treatment of psoriasis however forskolin and evening primrose oil may both be considered as additional substances to be added to a regimen to treat this particularly vexatious diseasedepressiondepression is believed to be due to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brainmost commonly either serotonergic inhibitory or dopaminergic stimulatory the response to various antidepressants depends on which neurotransmitter system has deviated farthest from the 34norm34 if the serotonergic neurotransmitters are most deficient serotonin precursors like 5htp or ltryptophan or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssri like paxil prozac or zoloft are most likely to be of help if the dopaminergic ie catecholamines like epinephrine or noradrenaline neurotransmitters are deficient catecholamine precursors such as the amino acids lphenylalanine or ltyrosine or monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as gerovital gh3 or deprenyl are most likely to helpgerman scientists have been working with a different approach to elevating catecholamines using a class of drugs that stimulate both the presynaptic as well as the postsynaptic components of catecholamanergic transmission this novel approach uses a drug rolipram which acts by increasing camp an action similar to that of forskolin and inhibiting phosphodiesterase although the researchers stopped short of recommending forskolin for the treatment of depression they stated clearly that 34elevated brain camp levels are closely linked to antidepressant activity in animal models of depression34weight lossin vitro studies show that forskolin stimulates lipolysis breaking down of fats in fat cells additionally scientists at the penn state university college of medicine have found that many obese people have lower than normal camp production based on these findings and in vitro studies scientists theorized that forskolin might be an effective weight loss agent especially for those with impaired camp production a recent small study appeared to confirm this conjecture six overweight women took 25 mg of forskolin 250 mg capsules of 10 percent standardized forskolin extract twice daily for eight weeks at the end of the eightweek trial the participants lost a mean of ten pounds and reduced their percentage of body fat by nearly 8 percent blood pressure levels also trended lower during the trial these preliminary results indicate that forskolin may be a safe useful adjunct to losing weight and maintaining normal body compositionhypothyroidismforskolin also has demonstrated the ability to increase thyroid hormone production and stimulate thyroid hormone release this mechanism of stimulating the thyroid to enhance metabolism may be one way in which forskolin promotes normal body weight forskolins effects in normalizing thyroid function may also contribute to its antidepressant effects as depression is a common feature of hypothyroidismcancer metastasesscientists at brown university confirmed that forskolin is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation as well as being a potent inhibitor of tumor colonization in mice they suggested that forskolin could find a place in the prevention of tumor metastasesimmune enhancementforskolin also exhibits potent immune system enhancement by activating macrophages and lymphocytesdosagebased on the human studies for weight loss 50 to 100 mg of forskolin taken in divided doses during the day appears to be a safe effective dose for the conditions discussed above
work well
i have been using this for trigger point release tool for myself and with my patients for years with success
i wear a womens size 7 the size small slippers were a little big but once i tightened it using the adjustment rope it was snug on my feet the interior was soft and felt nice it was a little uncomfortable walking around in the slippers because of the battery pack at the top of the slippers you definitely felt the bulky weight other than that the slippers were great they were nonslip so i didnt have a problem walking around it got nice and warm when i had it on the highest setting
its awkward to hold and use therefore some shavings dont make it in to the cup it does a pretty good job easy to clean
great to travel with
left a film on my mats and the scent was not pleasant just my observation and opinion
its ok not sure it does a lot but well see
this functions well as daylight alarm its best feature is that the leds arc out over the bed and shine down as opposed to other models which shine straight out horizontally which means you have to be on your side facing the lamp when the alarm goes off or else the light wont actually reach your eyes and wake you up and the head on this lamp swivels which makes it even better for increasing the chance the light will be pointing at your eyes when the alarm turns the light on so of the 3 models of daylight alarms ive tried this one wins hands down in actually waking me up with the lightbut this lamp has the absolute worst user interface imaginable zoom in on the control panel in the main picture and look at the controls now guess how you turn the alarm on on sunday night and off on friday night go ahead guess  ill waitdid you figure it out no of course you didnt because its completely unfigureoutable to turn the alarm on or off first press and hold the top left button which mysteriously has two overlapping squares until the border around the top left indicator icon in the display starts flashing then let go then press and release the same button again to make the border around the next indicator icon down start flashing then press the second button on the left which looks like a gear to make that second icon either start or stop flashing flashing means the alarm is enabled not flashing means the alarm is disabled then wait 1530 seconds for your change to take effect could you ever possibly have guessed that from looking at the controls absolutely not why doesnt it just have an 34alarm on  off34 switch seriously what on earth were they thinkingwant to know what time the light will turn on in the morning or more accurately at what time the light will be at full strength care to guess by looking at the controls  panel dont bother because you cant tell what time the alarms set for without setting the alarm time care to guess how to set the alarm time dont bother  you will literally never guessi could go on but you get my point i use this every weekday as my alarm because at least at the time i bought it july 2014 it was the only daylight alarm that allowed me to direct the light towards my eyes in the likely event that im not lying on my side directly facing the lamp at 630 am but if you buy this be prepared to read the user manual a few times and definitely keep the manual next to the light for a month or so until you get used to using the absolute worst user interface ever conceived for an alarm clock oh and be patient very patient because just turning the alarm on or off which should happen with the flick of a switch instead takes at least half a minute
these are pretty crystals and stones nice to carry around to help with stress
great product it worked great and was an easy fix i would purchase again
you get a number of tools for just 999 its not ideal for gifting since it doesnt come boxed or include a storage pouch like most other sets ive ordered im surprised everything arrived safely because the pieces were just packaged in plastic or bubble bags i did question whether the pieces were genuine stone or plastic they dont feel as cool as other stone tools ive ordered aventurine doesnt have as much natural patterning as something like amethyst so it does tend to look more like plastic there are some natural defects like pitting the roller is smooth and quiet so far but its not the best quality for instance the glue is a little messy overall its a decent set for the money
i like these clear shoe straps  i use them to keep shoes on my feet not just high heels
nice bandage just small no stick nice
this backnobber works great  i like that it comes apart  the different sized curves let you cover most areas of your back with ease and it allows for good leverage and a firm application
we take probiotics often and i try to switch up the brands since they all seem to have different strains in them  this will make a nice addition to my collection and we will rotate them in and out of our daily routine
while the patterns are a cute option and i like that its washable i suck this in when i breathe and find it very annoying a pretty much useless if you exert yourself at all
lots of paper i filled over 15 baskets for work will buy again next season
it is more on the sweet side than salty in my opinion it cannot replace regular soy sauce in recipe but it makes a great table condiment on rice or meat dishes and it is gluten free will definitely buy again thank you bragg
these are big softgels but they are easy to swallow so smooth the 60 softgel bottle is a 30 day supply just two a day provides 2500 mg of fish oil  epa 900 mg dha 600 mg other omega3 fatty acids 300 mg this is a good amounti have no problem taking this swallowing big smooth softgels dont bother me i get no stomach upset and not even any fishy tastes hint of lemon i keep it at my desk and have it shortly after my first meal of the day  i take fish oil for my health as we all should more specifically to keep my cholesterol on check all the other is bonus i got remiss on taking fish caps i normally buy liquid as it is usually easier to find the higher amount and many of the soft gels types that i have tried have been woefully low like maybe 10 of this i was working through some low dosetiny softgels i really need to get back to taking larger amounts daily the vimerson health fish oil omega 3 has allowed me to do that sometimes i add in my other softgels later in the day or take a swig of my liquid fish oil my doctor said i can up to 5000mg daily so i can double what i take of this or just use up my other stuffsome fish caps and liquids can have a fishy aftertasteburp i am not sure what causes that whether it is the formula or when it is taken i havent had that issue with these but i do take them after i eat in the morningi included pics of the softgels the measurement and even of one in my mouth i suppose one could pop the soft gels and empty it out onto a spoon or food but really these go down super easy unlike tablets capsules and softgels tend to be like that
great buydoes not leave an after taste
i bought this for facial pain and these are a super fit i use flour sack clothes as a cover for these they are super soft and the clothes provide a long length to wrap around my head to hold the cold pack in place i have migraines and these make my life so much better im glad i bought these
the dosage is 6 pills twice a day not a very good value smells fine tastes fine just too big a dose to get benefits i prefer a once daily tablet
what a difference i cant believe anybody has lived at all without one a little cumbersome sitting down but great to sue
great stuff but seems rub off easily which leads the need for several reapplications but when on performs very nicely
perfect for our white elephant party
this brand was cheaper than another popular brand but it seems fine i have used it for several weeks and i put it in a bowl of water in the microwave for a couple of minutes every week or so i already bought another one to take on an upcoming trip just because i wanted to start with a fresh sponge it seems to do a good job getting my face clearn
very feature full cost effective shaver
i recently purchased some lather cream for my husband as an alternative to his usual shaving cream so when i was offered a coupon for a shaving brush i jumped at the chance to get one so he could properly use his lather cream hes been using his new shaving brush for a couple of weeks now and so far so good first of all i was impressed with the packaging it came in a nice box which would be excellent for gift giving the handle is sturdy  fits nicely in your hand the beaver hair is surprisingly soft  my husband is pleased with the lathering that the brush produces the brush did have some shedding at first but as the description states thats normal and after those first few hairs my husband hasnt noticed any more shedding my husband has never used a lather brush before so he doesnt have anything to compare it to but it appears to be doing a good job and hes pleased with it
ive already used a few of these towels to clean my air fry oven and dual microwave convection oven that were in need of cleaning and it did a wonderful job my air fry oven and microwave look brand new again but this is not the main reason that i wanted thema while back i took on the endeavour of repainting my kitchen and bathroom cabinets i thought it was going to be a simple job but it turns out that theres a lot more to it than just a little sanding and painting its taking me a while im only halfway through and im on a little break right now but will be back at it within the next week or so these towels are going to be great for all the chemicals im going to have to use and all the scrubbing and cleaning im going to have to do especially in the bathrooms as i havent done any of the prep work in those two rooms yetim trying to go off memory of the proper steps so i may miss something you have to clean your cabinets with a strong special cleaner then lightly sand them and then reclean with a 5050 mixture of water and denatured alcohol you also have to keep ammonia on hand for some reason but i cant remember exactly why this might not be everyones way but this is just how i was taught to do it and its working well the job was taxing on me because i didnt have good towels to use i was using a sponge and paper towels for a good part of it and they just werent cutting it i think theres something in the makeup of these towels that make them clean better and will make my job of prepping my cabinets a lot easier ill also need them to wipe away any sanding dust in between coats and these will leave them lintfree unlike paper towelsjust from using a few of these to clean my air fry oven and microwave i know theres some super special cleaning power in these towels i know that they will serve me well while doing my cabinet painting jobs because of how durable they are and well they last im sure ill have some left over to do other cleaning jobs around the house i definitely recommend these towels

i have sinus issues so i use tissues a lot a lot im pretty picky no pun intended when it comes to the quality of my tissues since i use them practically every day i dont like thin scratchy tissues and i also dont like tissues that are too thick because i find them hard to grip ive always stayed away from tissues with lotion because in the past they have been too thick for my liking but i tried these and they are perfect not too thin not too thick comfortable and easy to use they arent scratchy they dont fall apart and they leave my nose happy

i dont understand how anybody could like this oil it smells exactly like house paint i expected earthy herbal chamomile and got house paint had a couple of other people sanity check my nose  they both agreed it smelled like nothing but paint fumes no idea
exactly as described both table cloths were thin plastic but they held up just fine throughout the party worked out great
helps organize and keeps me on track with my medication  in a few moments i am set for the next week
these bottles are perfect for blending your essential oils the size 10 ml is great for home use or for travel i will only use glass bottles for eo blends and prefer dark or colored bottles as the light wont affect the contents when ordering colored bottles it is important that the bottles are colored glass and not just colorcoated or painted glass these are colored blue glass the roller snaps on securely and after i filled the bottle i laid it on its side for 15 minutes to make sure it didnt leak it didnt the roller is very smooth and glides gently and easily not always the case with other bottles from other manufacturers the price was very competitive and with amazon prime free shipping the order arrived quickly i am very pleased with these bottles and will definitely order from this supplier again

this replacement bowl  lid works perfectly
fit the wp100 and works great thanks for making the replacement as our hose cracked at the handle  getting more use out of the unit  tx6262
wasnt sure if i was going to like this or even if it was going to work but im surprised and pleasantly charging it with a usb takes a couple of hours and then  you just push the button to the on position and push on the handle and you can light your candles and everything else just a tip  at 1st i thought it didnt work because i wasnt pushing the buttondown after sliding it on like you would a normal lighter but after you slide it to the on position you have to push that button to get it to light  love it and it will save me money on having to buy long lighters
this has a lavender note to it but not the strong unmistakable scent of any lavenderslavandins ive worked with before it is not floral to my nose at all it has a somewhat chemical pine like scent that is present that im not fond of there is no information about the oil as in the botanical name or its origin on the bottle or packaging im certain this is not true lavender
beautiful gilding flakes with the color of fall will look great on any project
easy to use  good quality product  thank you
very good for what i needed
love this toothbrush i can use it for about two weeks and then i have to recharge it has lots of great settings will purchase again if i need to
its the only cotton i use for my vape for the last 3 years or so i occasionally order different cotton and every single time i have my vape flavor suffers at best it dulls the flavor and at worst it adds a chemicaly taste that ruins my vape experiencethis is the best cotton i have ever used for my vape i cant believe how much of a difference it makes you would think it really wouldnt matter since the juice is doing all the work but it really doesim not into the price but for now its well worth it also one bag lasts me a long time so its not painful at this price point
have used for years  now i have a convenient case to carry in my purse
works perfectly for combining medications for emergency use  just what we needed
could not get either size to stay in ear go with high quality foam instead threw these away immediately
product arrived quickly the product is exactly as it appears online the colors shown in the photos are exactly the colors i receivedthe product comes in a plastic case for storage the top of my case had a crack in it upon arrival not a big dealproduct works exactly like expected getting your pet to cooperate with something like this its easier said than done recommend starting your pet using a product like this as a puppy or kitten if possible to acclimate themthe material of the finger brush is quality plastic or rubber it easily slipped onto my finger and more importantly stayed on my finger while using it was easy to takeoff and easy to cleanthere are two brushes connected for two different fingers i am not sure why in most scenarios i cant imagine you would be able to stick both fingers in your pets mouth at the same time and use both of them a one finger brush would be just fine
my feet fill great no greasy feeling
you get what you pay forcheaply made and not worth the effort
this product has definitely helped remove some hard water stains from around our sink area  we have terrible problems with hard water in our area i am happy if anything works my husband has been using it around the sink for about a week or so and the difference is noticeable  yay
have bought this many times this time they have changed the formulaflavortexture it is horrible will not buy again this happened with the mrm protein powder as well why the change
the scent is not strong enough
to soon to know if it work for me
ive used this for a month now the wood has stayed fine in my shower with no peeling or warping no bristles have fallen out my problem is that the bristles are super hard and scratchy like serious ouchie and they havent softened with a month of daily use also the plastic side is worthless and thats the only part that has discolored i cant really recommend so order with caution
these are great
horrible never got it wet and it turned my finger green in 2 days not worth the hassle returning it i regret having g one on the way for a friend im not giving it to her
i reordered this after good results from my first order  some people have difficulty getting the powder to dissolve  the company sent me directions and assurances that it will gradually dissolve and gel  the directions say to add a small amount of the powder in cold distilled water  at first it will be clumpy and cloudy but after a few hours in the refrigerator it will clear and gel  i then dilute it to the thickness i want  i was told it will be ok at room temp for a week and in the frige for weeksmonths  their customer service is very helpful and the gel itself is so good for my face  i use it night and day with a general face cream  i does not bother my skin at all whereas other products with other ingredients preservatives would cause my skin to sting a bit  i also use this as a topical cream for my knees and wrists in hopes this will help with my arthritis  it can be taken internally also as i am told
i use this soylent powder daily in my morning shakes the packets were handy when i needed to travek
cheeper than the mlm  i use now an then whan i was taking every day  my hair got very dark 
i really like this product i was concerned about the small size of the compartments but i found that it holds my prescription meds which are the most critical i can keep my larger supplement pills in another container and take them separately i take one star off because there are a couple of compartments that dont stay closed without bullying but out of 124 compartments 122 good ones seems pretty good to me the daily container is small enough to tuck into my purse so i can always have it with me when dosing time arrives i found it quite easy to load up and now i have a full month ready so i have no excuses
from the standpoint of a beauty device junkie this brush set is an excellent valueit is battery operated so no being tied to the electric outlet its sealed so using it in the shower is no problemit comes with a large body brushhead a petite size for the face a sponge head and a pumiceunlike the sonic vibration of a clairsonic this has a rotary action that type of action makes it possible to have this tool be pumice friendlyin my opinion it shines the brightest as a body brush as a preshower dry brush it preps legs and arms in the shower or tub use it wet with soap or body cleanserit removes dead dull flakes to help skin look bright and encourage new cell growthdisclosure product received to test with the option to review no financial compensation is ever accepted and vendor may request that item be returned after testingviews and opinions are my own i have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their itemyou are probably considering buying this product if you are reading this hopefully this review was was helpful but if not just let me know whats missing and ill try to help you
i thought i was receiving a larger size so when i received the very small bag that i paid over ten dollars for i wasam quite disappointed the amount i received is worth about 5 dollars max i got ripped off because i was in a hurry and not paying close enough attention to the ounces so be forewarned if you make the purchase you will be receiving a very small bag for over ten dollars
added a scoop to protein or fruit smoothies and loved it drinking it plain in water is a bit much but in milk or a nondairy sub like vanilla soy or oat its delicious
i love this soundmaker ive ordered a couple of them some as gifts it allows me to watch tv after my husband goes to bedbecause he is such a light sleeper he complained at first that it was too loud if he would use his eyes and not his mouth and read the directions he would have seen it has a volume control on it i didnt say anythinghe hee so i can hear the tv in the den when he goes to bed yea
great buy
very sturdy and im not the least bit concerned about it being able to support the weight of my husband when he needs to reach a little higher up
the bottle said the color was grey and it turned out to be navy blue color it peels off fairly easy also i just wasnt very satisfied with this product
i have sensitive skin and this keeps my hair healthy with no irritation
i bought this kit for the heels i wanted to wear to my college graduation i was breaking them in for weeks leading up to the ceremony i thought this kit would help but it didnt do anything and i was so disappointed the pads offered no support  my feet still kept slipping forward the pads even gave me blisters i didnt have prior to using them with the same shoes i dont recommend this product at all
love love love it such good quality and absolutely beautiful
these masks are comfortable fit well and have a nice neutral appearance but dang they come out of the package with a potent plasticlike odor theyve been out of the package 23 hours now and are sitting on my desk as i write this and the smell is still making me wheeze i just hope it does wash out
this is a cute set of 4 different holidaythemed face masks they fit my 8yearold perfectly and she liked wearing them to school to show her festive spirit she said they were comfortable and breathable
i love using it because it is the perfect firmness for a bath body brush  firm enough for exfoliating and soft enough not to scratch  why only 3 stars  it starts shedding bristles pretty quick still usable for awhile but then the plastic sheet that holds the bristles comes apart in pieces then not usable any morei did buy a second one hoping it lasts longer than a couple months
nice little key ring it has several little plastic containers that you can use for many different thingsim using it to carry with me oils for the sauna when going to the gym it is small and you can easily carry it with you
saw nicer ones at the dollar store
cleans the air before you inhale
ive been consuming fulvic and humic acids pretty much daily for the past couple of years in a shilajit form which is dark sometimes very thick and it never tastes good by itself  so when i saw trace minerals humic and fulvic acid on my list of items i could review i wanted to try it  ive purchased several trace mineral product before mainly their concentrated trace mineral drops and have found them to be very good quality  i think this trace mineral liquid gut health is a very good product and delivers some fulvic and humic acids that are so good for health and so rare to find in the basic american diet  this is not as concentrated as what you get in shilajit but its a big bottle one teaspoon is the daily dose and it has no flavor  it tastes like water  i think this is a very good supplement though i dont know if it will help with gut health or not but is still a healthy supplement shilajit can be very expensive a couple of hundred dollars depending on the quality but it contains a lot of trace minerals  but for a much less expensive substitute i think the trace minerals is a good choice
great work great
great taste good and useful on the road
did  not see any positive changes
a single sheet is good for a pair of underwear the soap dissolves quickly but the water does not feel too soapy so not sure about the quality of cleaning best is to let the clothes sit in the soap solution for 5 minutes before rinsing
just as advertized
liquid car wax ended up on the carpet of my brand new car this took it out on the first try after it been there for about 6 months
i seriously dont think these items travel well the scale is inaccurate and changes every single time you step on some days i weigh 60 and other days i weigh 150 returning this item
these masks we tossaways unless you have a small child these are uselessly small  what a waste
got out a set grease stain but didnt get out some dirt so i dunno but since then it has been wonderful
i like the way this fit on my face its stitched so it stands proud of your face so breathing is not too hard where some masks sit so close tom your mouth you tend to inhale some of the fabric if you exert yourself but that was all i really liked theres no slot for a filter and its only two ply and worse even though the ear straps stretch fairly well theres not enough elastic and they pull painfully at my ears you can see in the image how its pulling my ears forward i wish this had fit better because i like the design it looks like an old bandanna and i wore a lot of those camping and hiking  women teens and children will get a good fit out of this but its not for men with a largish head
needed them for security system  works great
make sure you dont poke your eye out though it is nice to have a curl to your lashes and this will do the job just be careful follow all directions carefully and you will pleased with the outcome
first time ive ever taken a tablet vs capsule and i really like it easy to swallow and provides 700 mg turmerictablet the tablets are much smaller than a penny and fit inside my pill box neatly they do smell like what they are which i like and makes me think they are fresh and active that said even though they smell spicy my tummy has never had an issue with them 240 in each bottle makes this an excellent value i love turmeric and the pain free life it allows me to live
i tried to wear but they hurt my feet so bad that i could hardly stand up then it cost me more to send them back than i paid for them
easy to use and looks great on many projects
great for the price the material is soft and feels high quality it does let a tiny light to enter trough the nose part but its ok for any comfy sleep
waste of money
this roller has really helped my husband his pt guy used it on him and he was amazed how it helped hope to get many years out of it
i wish the labels for the scented candle bath bombs included the fragrances rather than just lucky you or princess or to life since the bath bombs are described as aromatherapy candles and bath bombs the scent is clearly a big part of pureliss intentionsbut i couldnt make out any of the scents i tried passion since i figured if any color would stain me or the tub it would be the deep green bath bomb did the scent evoke passion for me nope i have no idea what it was supposed to smell like it didnt smell bad but my nose was cluelessthe bath bomb didnt fizz at all it floated around the tub and slowly dissolvedthe passion bath bomb did color the water a deep green color that did not stain at all so thats a plus
i used this as a filler for some pneumatic pressure gauges that needed filling  it works great for that
cellulite is one of those things that most adult women have in varying degreesthere are thousands of devices lotions and potions claiming to be the one miracle product that gives you the smooth skin we all long forin reality  there is no miracle still i really like this setthis massager works well to increase circulation and prep skin for lotions those acts alone can help improve the look of your legs and bottomthe round one is great in the shower using a cleansing oil to help it keep moving over your skinthe other one feels fantastic in or out of the shower it is an excellent relaxation massager from shoulders to feetboth are easy to grip and non slipproduct received to test with the option to review no financial compensation is ever accepted and vendor may request that item be returned views and opinions are my own
i accept we need to wear masks in public thats fine i dont mind i have some breathing issues copd but i dont run around with fake notes from fake government sites trying to get away with not wearing a maskthese seemed like a good idea for five or ten minutes then someone took a closer look other styles of these inserts have clips or hooks molded into them so they can easily be attached to the disposable paper style of mask these inserts lack any means to hold them in place youre expected to stuff this under your mask and wish or hope it stays in place it wont its going to slide around while your mask goes another way if youre lucky it wont pop out and fall to the groundbreathing while wearing a mask isnt fun you can do it doctors do it with much more restrictive masks for half a day or longer but this insert   youre literally blocking off 50 of the surface area inside the mask with plastic that blocks air flow i sat quietly for five minutes trying this mask out it became uncomfortably warm inside the mask i started to sweat when i tried to talk the insert slid about under my mask i had to take this off it was horrible according to one of the product images in the listing this product willrealive you from the bellow problerms mask stick to lipstick  did not test probably works not breathing smoothly  this hindered smooth breathing fogging of glasses  if anything these worsen how badly glasses fog sultry wearing a mask  this insulates and blocks airflow hot  stuffythese were and are a terrible idea i wouldnt recommend them to anyone   unless i really didnt like them
the stick connects to make it holdable however mine never clicked in place so it comes apart when i spray had to tape it together i know you get what you pay for but damn
with three dogs we get our share of little accidents and sometimes not so little accidentsthis spray works very well on pet odors including urine its very easy to use thanks to the spray bottle that directs the product just where you want itive used it on a variety of surfaces it cleans just about everything but really shines when it comes to my fur babies one of them is pad trained but sometimes misses the pad this cleans it up quickly and effectivelyit has an orange fragrance thats actually quite pleasant
i love the scent and the calming feeling it gives
we use magic erasers to clean so many things  have been using them for years and will continue to do so
as a person with a 40year history of allergies i honestly consider myself an expert on tissues  in fact i generally opt for paper towels as my goto tissue simply for their durability i generally do not care about the texture or feel  i found the kleenex expressions to be a refreshing approach to the standard box of tissues in that they not only holdup when used they have silky texture that glides the tissue across the skinwhat makes these tissue stand outmy constant need for having a tissue or ten on hand at any given moment has led to a more unconventional approach  using paper towels  the main reasons why ive opted for such a heavy duty approach are that most every tissue ive ever used presented three issues i couldnt stand  1 they easily blew apart and created a mess 2 they had little to no absorption quality and 3 they were super dry and always left tissue dust on my upper lip especially if i didnt shave that day  a paper towel was so much easier to deal with especially if you could not readily throw the tissue away after usethe kleenex espressions is a big step in the direction i was looking for in a tissue as all three of my issues are simultaneously addressed with this product  first the tissues are not dry at all and leave no paper remnants on my upper lip after use  coconut oil and aloe are infused into the tissue and generate a silky feel that is not moist but not dry  the tissue glides across the skin smoothly and does not leave any residue  additionally the constitution of these tissues allows them to be stronger and more absorptive that most tissues i have previously used  in other words they do not blow apart and generate a nasty mess after usewhile i am still reliant on my paper towel square as a standard pocket handkerchief for those with less heavyduty needs the kleenex expressions with the lotion infused in the tissue offers a high degree of comfort and durability  for the common cold or sinus infection where constant tissue use turns your nose raw this tissue would certainly be my recommendation
worked as expected
very poorly designed and potentially dangerous as to stay put around calf you need to apply too much tightness around therefore compromising circulation put in the trash after one use
i couldnt believe how this eliminated my allergy symptoms  i no longer need to take claritin or zyrtec which are chemicals id rather avoid
awesome massager i have a broken toe and it hurts from time to time especially a long day of walking it feels so much better after a couple rounds of massaging it i didnt mess with the setting but just a push of the power button it starts right away and provide instant relief kinda miss it now that i am not around home and wont be able to use it
you have to do it pretty slow and make sure you buff your nails with an actual sand type grit one before you use these or youll leave horizontal scratch marks on your nails you can only see the scratches at an angle but theyre there other than that the price and the shine these give me have me hooked ive been using them nonstop and cant stop showing people how shiny my nails are 
the berta hair straightener 1 inch worked alright on my hair my hair is past my thighs and thick i spend a lot of time trying to dry or straighten it the control buttons are on the inside of the handle i had some difficulty reading the digital display and it took some time to heat up it was a very good price though and it does work well
item was delivered quickly and is exactly as described
so very soft and makes a nice lather a tad smaller than i expected but i got used to it quickly  held up pretty well shapewise  i will be reordering
a friend of mine who is a dermatologist once said that petroleum jelly is one of the absolute best things you can use to soften and heal dry cracked skini like the value here and the ease with which the top comes off and gently snaps back on
i love these tissues because when i get sick my nose always gets raw and the lotion in these helps banish the redness i typically get they are ultra soft and absorbent and the boxes are small enough to keep one in every room of my house the boxes themselves are pretty enough to display without a tissue box cover and i love that they pop up and are always readily available whether youre battling allergies or the flu make sure you have plenty of these on hand because youll be hard pressed to find a better product
i love this lighter it works great for lighting candles  i love you can charge it and not worry about buying expensive butane lighters battery is long lasting  price is right i bought one for mother in law for stocking stuffer  very giftable
this is ok if you are only going to use it for a short time but i would invest in something better if you are going to wear it all day every day this item came with one set of glassesframes that you could stick the 5 disposable shields to it was pretty hard to get it to work it looked like there was a groove for the shield to fit into but i could never get it in the adhesive was pretty lame by the end of two hours it was coming off so much for extra protection
i really like these they work well when i ordered them they were priced at 39 and change now the prices have risen beyond 100 for the same product im disappointed in that  i probably wont purchase them again  they do seem to work well in a house with two dogs and forced air heating i have noticed a difference
they did the job and they are nice not cheap at all tho the price is high for stickers
these seem to be good simple inexpensive ear plugs nothing fancy here just the usual they work well enough and stay in fine i bought these to wear to a concert in a smallish venue 1000 ppl for a concert and the sound system in this venue is always far too loudmuch more than other venues these did the trick blocking enough of the sound to prevent ringing in the ears
this review is for the vanilla cold brew flavor this is so good its one of the best tasting whey proteins ive tried i usually add a lot of extra stuff to my protein shakes including cinnamon and extra vanilla this is great just on its own cold water frozen banana and this protein is refreshing and satiating all at the same timethe flavor is great and this is also a whey protein that i can feel good about with all of the quality ingredients the package is large too some of my other protein powders look about half full when they are brand new this bag holds a lot
the body brush is indeed only for your body unlike that from higher end models i have not used this in the shower with batteries because i am not convinced the casing will not allow water into the battery compartment
you will do good to use spirulina it is nutrient dense food and is good for you it may also help with allergies it helps remove metals it also is very high in chlorophyll good stuff
wifes reviewthis is a really amazing product if you are concerned about saving money and hygiene this is the perfect item for you the sponge is really durable and will last a long time and it also uses about half of the makeup product that a regular sponge would use it is also super easy to clean and since it doesnt absorb water or makeup you dont have to worry about letting it dry completely to prevent mold it does feel a little weird on your face and takes a little longer to blend out but i think it actually looks more natural and smooth once fully appliedim only giving it 4 stars because it is a little hard to blend into your hair line around your eyes and the crease of your nose but other than that i think this sponge is awesome
this moisturizer was suggested to my by my podiatrist this nonprescription product replaces a previous prescription given by him for extremely dry skin on my feet i works very well and is easier to use than the prescription since it is thicker and creamier less likely to drip during use
this product gets everything clean its the best
awesome comfort
works as good as deet spray
it did take a long time to ship but i have no complaintsi have never tried pine pollen before so i have nothing to compare it toit got here earlier then promised
like the scent but quality control is poor as some of the cans dont work
this brand was recommended to me on the diy eliquid forums and ive been 100 satisfied with it easy to work with very clean taste and nicely packaged in an hdpe bottle that has a safety seal on itessential depot also sells this on their website but with prime its a better deal on amazon however if youre looking for larger quantities essential depot sometimes has a 1 gallon pg1 gallon vg combo deal at a great pricehighly recommend this for diy use
i found that that hard round bit that goes over your knee was very uncomfortable and actually made my knee hurt more
perfect for a tween or teen i cant see this lasting long for an adult but it has been a good purchase for my 11 year old as we have started discussing the importance of keeping your skin clean
soooooo comfey and what we needed for stadium seating on wood seats we ordered four and four happy people

its imperative to get your omega 3s
what i likedeasy liquid form to add to teas smoothies and other drinks4250mg of elderberry extract very potentflavor is tart but sweet at the same time tastes great when added to other drinkswhat i didnt like bottle has a wide opening so its easy to pour more than 1 tsp if youre not careful i place the bottle lid over a teaspoon measuring cup which is also above my drink havent had any issues or spillsoverall great productupdate 1 nov 2021 still love this product and i keep purchasing it for the antioxidants especially during flucovid to solve the dripping issue i left the metallic covering on the bottle and used a razor blade to make a small triangle opening i place my finger over it while shaking the bottle and then i remove my finger to pour it into my teas no drip no messflavor is great
my wife loved the clamps the chain however broke on the first use
when i was visiting my son and wife they invited me to watch while they bathed their one month old daughter  i watched how uncomfortable it was for my daughterinlaw to be kneeling on the floor awkwardly reaching over the hard rim of the tub to bathe the babyi remembered seeing these knee and elbow pads for the tub and found some i liked  i sent them pics  they liked the gray ones and the larger ones  i found this was larger than the ones id sent photos of so would give them more space to move around onthey are very happy with this  my daughterinlaw likes the pockets to store items for the baby too  she says she wishes the edges of the elbow pad were padded too  thats a thought for this company to consider  but she really likes this  5 starit is washable  i was so glad to find something they like and they can use  this would make for a good baby shower gift that a couple might not think to buy for themselves  my son and wife hadnt known of these pads  i wish id had something like this when i was bathing my babies
love this product  doesnt leak and holds quite a large amount of product
this is a very cheap product does not remove a thing
never noticed anything different good or bad
really hard to use even cant install for benz cars
these fit perfectly and work very well
i have suffered achilles tendinitis which necessitated wearing a kneehigh cast for a monthsince then my sports doctor recommended that i always use gel heel pads however i discovered the pedag insoles while shoe shopping in new york my feet immediately felt more supported and comfortable using them however the price at the shoe store was to me exorbitanti contacted the mfr who suggested i shop online and lo and behold amazon has the full line at less than half the cost and what service do they provide we all know about their booksi have stocked up a couple of pairs and i acually gave my sister one of mine she was so impressed with how they helped her it is not just the feet but they help the entire skeletal system and the backnow i am able to wear thin flat shoes because the insoles provide the support invisibly without the bulk i  cannot live without them now and will alays keep a couple extra pairs on hand at amazons prices that is easy
not my first real silk sleep mask in short light breathable not hot blocks light good adjustable fit super silky doesnt dehydrate skin is gentle on skin no rubbing dragging cozy plush feel good stitching nicely packagedi rate this primarily on my experience i dont factor price in prices fluctuate there are coupons everyone has different budgets preferences and so on you decide if it is worth it this is actual silk and there is a price tag that goes with it not everyone wants a polyester dupe not everyone wants low level silk that feels like polyester if you have no preference then there are some lovely low level momme silk options as well as some nice polyester satin options for fraction of price this is for those that want actual silk rip silkworms  that being said i have used a wide variety of eye masks of different materials and styles here is my take on thisit feels light and lush very soft and silky i am privvy to the look feel performance of various textiles including various silk levels this is 25 momm and feels like it i dont question that at allsilk is nice for any skin but is particularly gentle on delicate skin or skin easily irritated it is breathable and it doesnt dehydrate already dry skin i notice that my skin is less parched when i use silk versus low end polyester that is material that is smashed up against my skin for 8 hours each night i would prefer to not have material that is rough and drags against my skin same can be said for pillow cases and my hair though i do keep other styles at my bedside i always come back to silk  i happened to be in need of another real silk mask because i accidentally washed and dried my trusty silk mask and it shrunk significantly note to self hand wash air drythe fit is good for me generous size which is nice for my wide face and big nose plenty of elastic and the adjustment option allows it to be as loose or snug as i desire i find that it blocks light from every angle i normally dont mind a little light to seep through so long as i dont notice while my eyes are closed but this blocks it all out for me i had to lift an edge to see if the tv was still on my hubs will watch tv in bed with sound offcaptions on i couldnt tell come morning i pushed the mask up a little so as not to accidentally sleep all daynot hot some masks really trap heat this is breathable again function of the material used of course any material can block light so it comes down to your needs and preferencesnicely packagedat time of review this was 35 with 30 coupon while i dont rate on price except for in the rate features section which i give 3 stars i will comment that 35 is the ceiling for nearly all 2225 momme silk eye masks if you can get it in the 20 something range then that is reasonable
these are very substantial and hold the shoes on securely i use them for dancing in heels
way to difficult to use would not recommend
i have been happy with this product for surfacedirt removal on old nonglossy dustjackets cloth boards and spines and the page block edges quick swipe with the grain along the topedge takes off dust buildup i have found it especially good for brightening up cloth boards that have become dingy with surface dirt this is not a stainremover if you deal with a lot of dusty books this is good for freshening them upupdate we are about to reorder some of these we got a good year out of them and really should have reordered at that point it speaks well of the product that weve been able to squeeze another year out of them we rinse them now and then but in the second year the sponges are still functional but they start to crumble and lose little pieces its a sponge and we use them pretty heavily so this is not a big problem for me the price is right for replacement well reorder again i am surewe use these to clean dust off the top of the page block and to take surface dust and mold off of the boards of a hardcover sometimes when endpapers get moldy you can use these sponges to take the worst of it off same with the underside of dust jacket that has been exposed to mold
great for use below stability tape also great to have around to keep a bandaid in place
excellent product that is precise and doesnt pull skin with the hair
if you like snacking yacon slices are ideal  slightly moist and chewy and sweet  i however am not a snacker  i bought them for the gut benefits  yacon contains a prebiotic inulin which breaks down into a probiotic fructoogligosaccharides which helps promote a healthy happy gut  yacon is a pleasant way to keep your microbiome happy
what can you say about this product hopefully it does what it says it does
i do volunteer work where we do free dental work  and i bought these to include in a post procedure  package wverythung was perfect and im very happy these were cheap enough that we can continue to buy and provide our service at low cost  good product
they cut very well and are as advetised
i received a 1 oz sample of this to remove a automotive badge i sprayed it on the vhb adhesive residue and came back a few minutes later ready for a struggle to my surprise the adhesive just wiped away with a paper towel i was shockedi then purchased this bottle and have used it on every sticker adhesive label in sight in the past i have tried 3m adhesive remover and griots garage adhesive remover but nothing even remotely compares to thisincredible 
great addition for 21st bday
unfortunately these are way to easily broken  they break as soon as they poke or bend in the slightest way
this flat iron has changed my life i have incredibly thick hair and every time i use these my hair become silky smooth i recommend you purchase these irons because they will change your life too
cheap the soap leaks out of the sponge
dont look or fit good at all and i checked the measurements against my foster grant reading glasses these are very poor quality and are extremely uncomfortable
this brush bristles were way too short for me im sure others may feel differently about the brush it just wasnt for me so i returned this item
i love these roller bottles so much so that ive purchased another set  i have been using them with my essential oil mixes and they have been fabulous  i only had one instance where the little roller ball came out but i popped it back in and it has been fine ive had this happen to me with an expensive brand that i purchased through a distributori highly recommend these
i got it for christmas as a gift its may and it wont work it had water in it we cleaned it out dried it out and put fresh batteries in upon using it stopped after 15 seconds it was full of water again
the problem is that if oils leak you need a new insert of foam rubber  i need one  i put tin foil in the oils where oils leaked  otherwise love the case
this is a great product and is extremely helpful for someone with blood sugar issues  it takes some experimentation for cookingbaking but is worth the effort  i love it
you can tell the difference in quality during the pandemic will see if the prices come down when things return to normal gotta love supply and demand without morales
works ok spring seems to stretch out after time
i liked the concept and i had high hopes the bubbled side was useless and the bristles side was almost as useless very soft on the body so it pretty much glides all around and doesnt actually scrub slough massage or clean it depends on the persons needs but the product is definitely not for me also thick creamy body wash like dove just gets stuck on the bottom of  the grooves and doesnt suds up nor easily rinse clean i didnt try with more liquid body washwish i could return it
very sturdy easy to use and you can pick up a dime with it
works better than goo gone  we pay this much for an 8 oz spray bottle
nice roomy basket i use to keep dog toys and balls on my back porch for my dog
i drink camu camu in my juice or in my smoothies i bought some camu camu as well for a family member even if a person did not want to use camu every day it is a good product to have in the cupboard when you start feeling like you are run down  take camu camu for a few days if you feel as if you are on the verge of coming down with a bug add camu to your diet when everyone at the job was getting ill i sailed on through every time as healthy as can be although some people say that camu does taste a bit bitter i found that varies with brands regardless i simply mix it with my bullet or blender not a spoon with apple juice or pine apple juice if im not adding it to one of my34mean green34 smoothies ive tried 3 different brands and i like majusi did not find it sour tasting this is an organic product which is high in vitamin c
very nice item it makes a little noise but its fine refreshes the air effectively i am a college student and my roommate smokes so i got this cigarette smell through the vent and this device helps a lot i add some essential oil there for aromatherapy
i bought this then went to a pure romance party and found out you can use it for a lot of things like spraying under your bra line to stay fresh or in shoes smells great
works good for large plants
i think it might be good but too harsh on my stomach
its not like the old white pearl drops
good but dont know why you cannot ingest
not what i expected
it works great wish i could see the graduation a little bit more
the tea is tasty and does seem to settle irritable tummies  i tried the loose tea since it seemed to be more economical  bad decision  after trying 3 different tea strainers all unsuccessfully  the tea leaves drift through the strainer and the cup had too many loose tea leaves to bear  i shall stick to the tea bags  too much work too little time to necessitate double straining tea thus the reason for four stars
this product is great better than any other heating pad i have ever purchased it is soft and heats my whole back and shoulders it is a must have item
i had covid my taste  smell ability was impacted and i had huge drainage from my sinuses ick  no other mouthwash got the bad taste out of my mouth and kept the bad taste away it also helped my sore throat now im better and im not going back to any other mouthwash
tumble smells like a mans cheap cologne it does not smell like anything you would expect or want a baby to smell like okay for a man i suppose
ive tried and tried and tried but i cannot get an accurate weight on this scale its not even consistently off ill get on and it will say 145 step off step back on and it says 152 get off and get back on again and it says 143 it seems closer at lower weights but still off  do not buy this its worse than no scale
5 mins to deep clean the pores 5 mins to do facial treatment prep 5 mins hydrating 5 mins moisturizing once a weekif you are in a hurry just take the 1st step and 3rd step the machine is well made donts no alcohol or oil on the metal head do not use machine during shower keep it away from water
to my surprise it really does work  i have this little shaver that goes through aaa batteries pretty quickly so i put the batteries into the device and plugged it in  three days later the renewing light blinked out ie the battery was renewed so i tried the batteries out and they are working like new  it was very easy to use too  if you use a lot of aa or aaa batteries id highly recommend this renu it battery renewerupdate i found that if i didnt immediately use the renewed batteries they would start leaking  so either dont leave the renewed batteries sitting around unused or get normal rechargable batteries which is the option ive finally ended up going with
this product didnt lift yellowing caused by longterm storage in any way
my youngest has had issues staying asleep at night purchased this and she seems to like it as she has been sleeping better at night
beautifully packed great for gifting high quality soft brush one for you one for a friend very nice
this has a really good lemonlime mountain dew baja blast flavor  it mixes well and does what it needs to do i the tub is very small i didnt realize that it was a sample size so the price isnt as attractive as it seems  other than that complaint i can recommend it isnt too sweet and definitely works
very easy to use very comfortable provides relief from pain due to slouching which most everyone does this really helps at first we were doubtful but after using for a while it shows my posture is way better and my back doesnt hurt as much
my husband has a goatee and mustache so regular masks dont work well for him they tend to creep down as he talks uncovering his nose which is problematic i decided to order this mask for him and it seems to work its larger and the long attached string keeps lets it hang around his neck when he pulls the mask itself down he likes it a lot thanks
used this to break in some 700ho brushed motors worked perfectly
easy clean starts helping pain at oncerelaxes muscles more then equate roll on pain reliever
my old handle had started sticking with the button  easy to replace and now it works as it should
wonderful product i ordered this last week and received within 12 working days i actually got much more than i expecting from this casual microfiber shower wrap the comfortable stuff quality fabric smooth touch great water absorbent and relaxing feel is what i need for a cool shower after a hectic day in office
my dog had a broken toe we used this for a week exactly what we needed  we kept it dry an wouldnt let her chew or lick her foot
i just wanted to give it 5 stars and be done with the review but they require a description on amazonso ill post my moms secret chocolate chip cookie recipe here instead not so secret anymore is it mom4 cubes butter softened2 heaping cups dark brown sugar packed then heap that shiz½ cups white sugar2 tablespoons vanilla1 ½ teaspoon salt1 ½ teaspoons baking soda3 eggs6 cups flour1 bag chocolate chips semisweet or sweetmix by hand all ingredients except flour and chips mixing by hand makes them taste better trust methen add flour and chips and stir by hand bake  350 for 911 minutes on ungreased cookie sheet enjoy the preciousesnote makes a buttload of cookies so you might want to halve the recipe
i normally get another brand of moringa powder so im comparing it to thatand in comparison the only difference is that this one is a slightly better priceboth are a fine powder with a slightly vegetable type of scent and flavorif you use a small amount it can be mixed in just about anything but the more you use the more pronounced the flavor is going to be and its definitely vegetable not fruity or herbalyou can bake with it put it in the smoothie or put it in a salad dressing its a good way to bump up your super veggies
i sure could have used this sound machine when my son was a baby  the sound quality is clear and authentic  the sounds are so soothing gentle and pleasant  i dont feel like the sounds are repetitive  i am listening to the lullaby one while typing this review and i am ready to nod off  it is a compact sized at only 5 inches in diameter and 15 inches tall  it is made of high grade plastic  it is powered by an usb plug  there is no option for batteries usage though  there are 8 sets of controls including the onoff switch and they are located on the top of machine  it is very easy to change the settings by using a light toucha nifty feature is that the color of the machine changes with the touch of a button  very muted and relaxing  there is an option for onoff light  the timer can be set at 15 30 60 90 and 120 minutes  everything gets shut off quietly when the time is up  although i pretty much have dozed off by then  i would definitely recommend this sound machine
they dont quite fit true to size but they perform very well overall i notice less fatigue after long runs or after refereeing soccer games  these are a good value for the money
these are not the best reading glasses that i have had before and i have bought plenty of the cheap dollar store glasses these do seem to be well made but they are pretty small for me and dont fit the face very well i tried to bend them and give them a bit of shape but it doesnt seem to help them fit better or even feel comfortable however they do the job for reading at the computer and other things plus you get three pairs for the price just in case you loose one pair you have two others overall they are okay and will work for anyone in a pinch or just needing some cheap glasses that they dont mind something happening to
a quiet hum so i know its working not sure that it is really making a difference but i like to think i breathe easier when this is plugged in
i just received this beeswax pauls pail and i must say it is fabulous i have a very expensive genuine leather brief case that i purchased well over twentyfive years ago  i washed my brief case off with a damp towel and then applied this wax in circular motions to my briefcase i allowed it to dry according to the directions and polished it with a soft cloth my briefcase looks new again i then tried this on a new leather pencil case i just purchased and it even made the new case look fabulous great find thank you pauls pail
screwdrivers are what i was looking for the nose cushions are excellent other stuff i imagine will be helpful on an as needed basis would purchase again
i have tasted quite a few different wheatgrass drinks over the years i even still have a wheatgrass juicer somewhere in my garage that i spent a few hundred dollars on while wheatgrass may be very healthy for you it honestly tastes horrible you know that smell when the neighbor finishes mowing their lawn that smell is exactly what whatgrass tastes like minus the scent of gasolinei have tried using or juicing wheatgrass at various points in my life but those phases never seem to last long besides the horrible taste it causes me an upset stomach and leaves a very horrible taste in my mouth i cant say as this product tastes any different than other powders or fresh juiced wheatgrass that i have had in the past i was willing to give wheatgrass another try but about 1 serving was all that i could take i dont have anything against this particular brand theres no way that i would order it again though ive never noticed any positive benefits from the product personally though so i cant honestly think of any reason to recommend it
it is great for drying hands and certainly more hygenicit is good for company to use also rather than guest towels just use themand dispose dont know what i did without it
my little guy can sit up in the tub now while i bathe him  this item is like a third hand from time to time
i am not big on apple cider vinegar supplements but my son likes them these have a pretty strong vinegar scent when you open the bottlelike many gummies there is a lot of glucose to cover up the medicinal tastes so be aware of that especially if you are diabetic or prediabeticthe taste is pretty good once you chew on them you dont really notice the vinegar muchas far as helpful well not sure there is any way to quantify that my son says they help with his digestion i do trust the solger brand
these smell great and are great quality worked very well very pleased with this box set
i hope you like the sensation of altoids on your gooch i sure dont
ive been using probiotics for years and have appreciated the benefits this version didnt offer any significantly different benefits in terms of probiotic activity for me but it does come with one big plus they taste greati normally use pills for probiotics since the chews ive tried were not all that appealing in terms of taste these are much different  they are round balls about the same size as a typical malted milk ball it has a waxy coating so it does not melt in your hand the dark chocolate taste is excellent it does not have the same texture as actual chocolate its a bit more grainy but it is very tastyprobiotics are great to keep everything running smoothly in your gut and this is the best tasting option ive come across the only downside is that the cost per dose is higher than many of the capsulebased probiotics still its a great way to encourage probiotic usage since taking one can be considered a treat rather than a chore and easily earns this 5stars
vitamin e oil is great for helping to prevent scars ive used this oil on my face and on my arm it seems to help cat scratches heal faster it is thinner than a straight e oil from a capsule it is more liquid because it has coconut oil and jojoba oil in it it is easy to apply with the dropper that is included this bottle will last you a long time it is nice to know this is organic and healthy for your skinthe rebecca review
it seems to work
i have heart issuesearly extra beats which to me feel like the cold finger of death in my chest when they happen they started becoming more regular and although the doctor said not to worrypfft i did and still do i began taking coq10 3 months ago and was thinking today that i hadnt felt an early beat in some time now i considered the stomach pain worth it relatively i received this bottle at a discount in exchange for my honest opinionreview and unlike the other brand ive been taking this does not upset my stomach in any way shape or form i am thrilled coq10 does indeed help with brain fog but for me the benefits to my heart are the be all  end all if coq10 upsets your tummy do yourself a favor and try this brand
very poor communication with seller waited for product in the mail never came over several weeks  contacted seller and finally sent product  would not order from them again  pillows okay they are stuffed will small light weight pellets not the most comfortable after breast surgery  i believe a softer material for fill in the pillows would be more comfortable
i liked the flavor i disliked that it is hard to mix without lumps i just mixed with a spoon a blender would probably do a better job but to much trouble
amazing little machine really gets the job done i highly recommend
small package fits easily in carry on  a travel necessity
very cute and heavy duty great buy
proappears to be well madeworks well to shave my headother attachments are a good bonusconscannot think of any 
the best part of this mop and bucket system is the mop handle it is stainless steel it is super sturdy andit it long enough 49 for me 510 to hold comfortably if you need it shorter remove one section and it will be 38i can really push into the floor without worry of this pole breakingeach section screws on it comes with two cleaning padsthe bucket it as pictures tall and thin does not take up much space in terms of storage i havent knocked it over yet but i am aware that it could due to its tall center it is a nice change from peeling the pads off and rinsing them by handmicro fiber pads are pretty standard they work the same as any of my others just presses on or peels off easily interchangeableyou can access the interior of the bucket for in depth cleaning and drying of the bucket if need be by popping out the handle then the rest can pop out the bucket is surprisingly sturdy as well it isnt a cheap feeling system at allthe swivel mop portion is magnetic so it will store as one long pole also makes it easier to use the bucket as you wont have a mop head impeding quick insertionoverall i am impressed i am most excited for the metal pole i am not used to using a bucket dont feel i need one  but this is neat to have again i have not knocked it over it seems to be well balanced it works as described i have 2 big labs and lots of sandy soil that gets tracked in with them so floor sweeping vacuuming and washing is a regular chore
i like the convenience of gummies since my son cant swallow pills  he likes the flavor
excellent coffee chocolate creamer collagen has been a definite skin enhancer and joint lubricator for me for yearsdelightful much better than expected
best product out there containing all daily minerals great taste the 20 peach is too yucky so im sticking with this flavor just beware if you are on pain pills or management like percocet oxycoctin methadone etc taking this daily as directed will clean you of all your meds and put you into withdrawal learned that the hard way my pain dr informed me of this as well otherwise highly recommended
daughter purchasedloves it
not what i wanted had great reviews so i ordered but the pink necklaces are purple definitely not pink at all it will still work for my gender reveal but i do not recommend these if youre looking for pink and blue beads like it says in the description 
these are a nice assortment of sanding twigs i use for sanding metal clay before firing the price is a little high given i found a much larger quntity on another site for less per twig but given i wanted these fast it was worth it to buy them here with my free shipping
i purchased this product about 23 weeks ago and have the same effect as elyce rose elyce rose it is horrible for the past two weeks my face tingles and feels pressurized and feels like it is about to explode and i feel dizzy this is a horrible product that clearly contains niacin b3 it does not even keep me alert or give me energy thats the worst part in fact the last few times ive taken the pills ive fallen asleep within an hour after  i am in good shape exercise daily and eat very balanced and healthy  but stay away from this product it seems like it does a lot more harm than good
im a little meh on these  i get a lot of relief from the support and warning aspect of regular kt  this isnt as sticky or stretchy and these no stiffness that leads to the support from regular kt tape  the directions are also weird it says not to apply more than 3 tapes at once and i know too much lidocaine can cause arrythmia but they guy pictured on the can is wearing 6 tapes  anyways the lidocaine pain relief isnt that noticeable for me i used 2 strips then combined w 2 strips of rock tape for support for taping my knees  its not bad and time will tell but i dont think im having as much pain relief and support as with the rock tape and it only comes in white  worth trying  i may not have enough pain today to need this and may try again on a bad day
i have very oily skin and had to wash my cushion daily and change it monthly or it wouldnt seal i thought i would try these to see if they would help so far they are working well there is a bit of air leakage and i have to have the straps tighter but there is none of the annoying noise associated with the leakage i also havent had the skin irritation i sometimes get with the silicone cushions they seem like a less expensive alternative to changing my expensive cushions my only criticism is that they are not custom made to a particular mask and that the opening must be hand cut it would be nice if they would custom make them to fit the popular masks
this supplement gave me a boost to focus better and a bit of mental clarity easy to swallow and so far no side effects good quality supplement
very good product i used it once and it really helped
this works as intended but it just cannot compare to the ones that have a bigger pouch for the feeding tube honestly this is just now the back up one it washed ok but even in the small garment bag and on delicate it has started to fray
i purchased this for my motherinlaw as she was looking for one for her dogs and she loved it she is very satisfied with it
our bathroom toilet has had a persistent issue with mineral deposits we have a well  nothing i had tried would touch the most stubborn of them  so ring around the toilet in spades  doing some nosing around online i came across these pumice stones and decided to try themto say they work is an understatement  one of them removed mineral stains that had been on the toilet for years in a matter of a couple minutes work  why didnt i find these before now  the one place that is still a problem is under the front right edge of the toilet  i just cant seem to angle the pumice to get at the buildup in that one spot  but otherwise im a very satisfied customer
small size for purse or back pack
didnt work dont waste your moneyi shouldve read the other reviews 
got a new pair of dress boots i love except that the heels dont have a good grip and i didnt feel comfortable walking on tile or slick hardwood these took care of itthey are shaped for toes but i needed it for the heel so i used scissors to cut to fit which was easy enough  i thought that since the fit wasnt exact they might have a tendency to peel off but ive worn the boots several times the these grips are still stuck tight  i imagine they will eventually peel but for the price im willing to replace once or twice a season if necessaryi was also worried that they might be too rough me to want to wear on our nicely finished floors but they seem okdownside they took a long time to be delivered like over three weeks  buy before the season starts
great glasses and price 
excellent no twigs or anything like that i also checked it and it turned my flashlight on so its the real deal
best tile cleaner ive ever used night and day difference ill never buy the crap they sell at home depot again
ive been taking magnesium citrate for years after totally not being able to go ive tried other brands and wanted something that wasnt a horse pill though the pills are smaller just one will make me nauseous i thought for a while i might be sick until i ruled it out to these pills second day of not taking them and i feel normal again just keep in mind these are potent and while they may work for you it didnt work for me
just as described
my son is almost 9yrs old  he had been wet every single night since birth he would often wet through pullups  it was really starting to effect his selfesteem  sleepovers and scout trips were difficult  we had tried limiting fluids waking him during night to use bathroom we had even tried prescription medication  we had also tried another alarm called the potty pager  it was difficult to use uncomfortable and ineffectivewe started using this wireless alarm since comfort was a big deal for my son  it worked in just a few weeks  when he did wet it was usually just a few drops and it woke him and he could finish in toilet  usually even the sheets were still dry  just put new underwear on and back to bed  it made the whole process not disruptive at all  i know it sounds cliche but i wish i had gotten this system a long time agoas product stated the first few nights my son slept through alarm  his room is 2 doors down from mine  i am a fairly light sleeper and it would awaken me and i would go wake him up  after just 23 times the alarm would wake him up
i love the style of these glasses the lenses are larger than some so i have a larger reading area these are lightweight and mostly comfortable but are a little tight on my head they wont slip off so thats nice  maybe they will loosen up with breaking them in i will update my review if they get a little looser upon use  i like that they come in blue and red so they go with several different outfits the 225 reading level is perfect for me to use my phone i like that they block the blue light because i do use my phone before bed although they are lightweight they are strong
whats not to like about lavender lasts long and smells amazing
works wonderful for bridge work and or partials etc perfect for hard to reach places or narrow spaces i am glad i purchased taking care of my teeth has never been easier product arrived in a timely manner item in good new condition will purchase again thank you
my husband was experiencing what his doctor thought and what i suspected was beginning stage dementia one example at a buffet restaurant hed forget where we were sitting and go sit at another table by himself i was desperate to find something to help him because he refused to see a specialist then i read about lions manes reputed help with memory loss and i looked for a highpotency product on amazon i chose relentless improvement brand because it has no fillers and seems to have the greatest bang for the buck after 2 12 months of continued use 23 capsules daily i cant believe the change he seems just like his old self again and im no longer worried hell pull out into oncoming traffic while driving its like a gift from heaven
i did not believe all the hype but my dil kept promoting this product to me so i finally decided to give it a try it lives up to all the reviews i have gotten out old setin stains the other day it beautifully removed a blood stain from a bed sheet that i had been unable to get out for months was ready to just buy a new bottom sheet after one washing with the dreft stdin remiver i put the sheet on the bed the stain was near a corner pocket i searched and searched for the stain but found nothing  not even the telltale shadow ring that blood usually leaves it is an expensive product but i will not hesitate to buy more bc it works better than anything i have ever used
very true to black cherry scent and very strong so use very little
this bottle contains 120 softgels and each softgel contains 2000 iu of vitamin d3 in extravirgin olive oil the softgels are small in size and so are pretty easy to swallow if you choose to chew the softgel it does not taste bad the softgel capsule is made of bovine gelatin glycerin and water they are self certified as nongmo and i appreciate any product that is nongmo
pads that cover the d rings are very uncomfortable under the arms  other than that it works as expected
my dad loved it  i bought this for him
surprisingly neutral tasting considering all the green ingredients easy to drink flavor it is designed to be added to a smoothie not for use as a smoothie itself but i wanted to get an idea of the overall taste so i blended 1 tbs with 8 unsweetened almond milk and it really just disappeared not much flavor which i find to be a good thing i really was expecting it to taste awful lolit has some erythritol 45 grams per 1 tbs serving i missed this when looking at the ingredients because it is not listed in the ingredients just in the nutrition panel i could do without it but it doesnt overpower at all i find that when products use non sugar sweeteners they go way overboard with the sweetness this doesnt impart much sweetness or much of any strong flavor1 tbs has 110 calories so be mindful of how much you use hence why it is best added to a smoothie or whatever else you wanti like all the food based ingredients and i feel good adding this to my assortment of supplements i add to my daily smoothie nice way to boost my nutrition since i have not been consuming as much fresh food as i should lack of availability super high pricesid get this again 45 stars  5 stars since i like it more than 4
long time getting here fits fine in brush handle
great noise reduction in bulk for a great price highly recommend them if you are responsible for firing range activities
barley grass has been well known as a superfood for at least 30 years which is when i was first introduced to it and began taking it some of the well documented health benefits of barley grass includeit is a source of high quality protein vitamins and mineralsit is filled with chlorophyll which is a powerful antioxidant as such it is very helpful in controlling or preventing many diseases due to enhancing immune function some of these diseases include heart disease cancer diabetes arthritis osteoporosis inflammation and diseases impacted by inflammationbarley grass powder is similar to wheatgrass powder as to its health benefits and both tend to be quite expensive buying this organic green superfood in bulk from this vendor is a costeffective way of obtaining this wonderful supplement
i have the exact same jigsaw health pickleball electrolyte powder but in a plastic can and use it a lot  so when i saw these individual packets available for review i instantly selected them  i really like this electrolyte mix  i play a lot of competitive tennis  singles and double  underneath the hot sun in the deep humid south  i sweat like a sailor and need instant electrolyte replacement  i have tried and reviewed a lot of electrolytes  some i like a lot like this one and others that i save for when its cold outside and i dont sweat much  this pickleball electrolyte is my first choice because it contains more potassium sodium and magnesium than any of the others that i have  these packets make it easy to take some along in my tennis bag and mix up a bottle when i feel i need it  this electrolyte mix is some of the best ive ever had the opportunity to try and review and i cant find anything negative to say about it  it mixes easily in water and has a nice orange flavor
this probiotic was just okay nothing extraordinary i also felt like it helped excess bloating  i took it as directed
oh how this has helped me i was running and even walking longer distances and getting serious blisters on the bottom of my feet before i resorted to duct tape i wanted to try anything else and i read about this so far it has helped and i havent had blisters yet fingers crossed it continues to help so i dont keep getting blisters on the bottom of my feet
my husband loves camay and i found this is a great way to purchase it  the soap came wrapped well and in great time  i would buy again
perfect dryer  exactly what i wanted
i am from the olden days my family always having camphophenique on hand for every kind of injury it is still prepared as it has been for decades the formula not changing which makes it all the more successful to me it brings comfort having this product on the shelf always ready to handle those sores pain and little hurts34
i got small and i wear a size 4 womens and size 3 child  it was a wee big so i havent gained much from wearing it
nice appearance and great packaging there is no smell and virtually no taste so theres no need to mask the taste or put it into your food or drink i like this product and will purchase it again
these are definitely the cutest little boxes to stuff favors in  very very nice and elegant
i found that the ulla sometimes did not blink regularly but the worst thing is that it falls off if you rub or bump it against anything  consequently i lost it in a movie theatre  they need to make the clip tighter so it doesnt come off the band as easily
these work in a pinch but honestly not nearly enough of the water beads to keep them cool long enough no idea about heat wise i leave them in freezer for migraines they do help a little but my cheap 3 one i bought from target last year works so much better
feels very nice  i did get it a little to large for my hand  i did think this has two in it but it was only for one hand still over all very happy with it
i got this machine promptly and everything they said was there is there the power source works the machines are good there is one bad thing im not sure what the problem is but the needles hook will hardly fit onto the machine part you have to force it but it still works just as well just like everyone else says the ink is only for practicing and the practice skin sucks use a honeydew melon to practice on and if you are going to do it on real skin at any point buy skin candy outlining ink
these are the st i have used several butt wipes over the years these are the best they dont have any perfume crap scent they are thick enough so you dont accidentally give yourself a digital strong enough for a heafty man butt
this gets the job done  i barely have to file my nails after
i know this is a cream but i really didnt expect it to be so thick normally hyaluronic acid that i am used to is a light weight gel type cream i might repurchase depending if i absolutely need it because its not something i would care to have i use another hyaluronic acid cream right now this is quite thick and the way that dermatologists recommend you apply a hyaluronic acid is on wet skin after cleanser essence or toner whichever way your skincare routine goes however i felt as if i couldnt apply anything more after this i have a minimal skincare routine due to having sensitive skin and using retina this also has fragrance it is a great value however so for now my skincare in the morning goes  cleanse  hyaluronic acid and moisturizer typically i would have wanted to apply a vitamin c but cant on top of hyaluronic acid as it doesnt sink in all the way
a gotta have  dont wait for plumbing emergencies simple little gizmo that works 
so good love blending it in my morning coffee with butter and mct c8  not overly sweet like some others ive tried perfect vanilla flavor not artificial or candy like at all better than a starbucks vanilla latte i also add and egg yolk
theyre greatrecommend
good product seeing how it is advanced rather than complete felt like bait and switch but not worth the hassle of returning
great stocking stuffer  i bought a bunch of these to give away to my friends at christmas along with a set of nail stickers  its etched glass so the effectiveness will last a very long time  this is a good quality nail file  i have one at home and one for my travel bag  at this price you could get one for everyone on you gift list and extra for your purse and car and office
just started using it but i can say last night was the first night my feet didnt hurtburn all night  excited to see what it brings in the near future
worked very well on my dogs paws its pretty quiet and cant hurt your pet
the consistency is a decent mix of moist and thickchewy close enough to a real brownie the taste is unique it has a fairly distinct sweetness that stands out and will be a deal killer for some with low sugar and about double the protein as compared to fats the macro nutritional count is good if you are used to sacrificing taste for nutritional value youll probably be used to these trade offs if you are looking for an actual brownie youll be disappointed personally id rate the eat me guilt free nutty monkey brownies as better if you are looking for a snack that doesnt disrupt your macros
typical plastic pill boxes  i put the one capsule rx i take in this  first i just dumped a bunch in loose and counted  every time i tried i fit 20 or less  i also fit 20 perfectly when i organized them neatly  then i realize my probiotic capsule was just a touch larger so i tried those  i could only fit 16 of those  either way these are a nice size for storing things like otc pills or prescriptions in your bag without having to take full bottle and without having to rely on the more expensive individual travel packs
the cords are very nice but the tool they give you to help install them was not easy to use
i do a lot of computer entry not sure if that is causing the issue  ive been to physical therapy numerous times over the years  so i know which stretching exercises to do  there are times though the nerves act up  stress is one of them  before i put the adhesive on i try and locate the kailo around the area i think it might help which for my shoulder is partially on my back and then i bring it up a bit on top of the shoulder  when the area of the skin starts to feel like its getting warmer than the other area of my skin i know something is happening  i try to leave it alone for a couple of hours  today i tried it on my leg since my ankle has been also having some pain  when i placed it along the side of my leg again i felt a bit of warmth happening in the area  subtle  that pain has gone away  i did leave it on for several hoursi do see a chiropractor actually have been going to them for 30 years when required  if youve been in any type of accident things start showing upone note this is a trial and error to find the spot  a couple of times this didnt reduce the pain  if its too intense i know i need to call the chiropractor and take a pain pill or muscle relaxer till i get their
a little disappointed i have another air purifier by the manufacturer and it works great so i thought this would be perfect for the laundrylitter box room it was great for size and didnt scare the kittens but it didnt do much for the odor
bought this to make homemade fog fluid for my fog machine  mixed it with distilled water and couldnt tell the difference between the homemade solution and the store bought brand  also works well with potassium permanganate as a quick fire starter for all of you science enthusiasts
im giving this 4 stars because it smells just what you would expect fresh baked brownies i buy from another vender who is cheaper 16 oz 2000 thats whyi didnt give it the fifth star
the product is just as described fresh raw and organic great its convenient that the container has a zip closure that actually works well and provides a moistureproof seal i read that sesame seeds are beneficial for osteoarthritis in the knees im trying to include 2 tday in my diet this product works well for me
these gloves have been the best to use comfortable my hands dont sweat i used one pair to stain my stairs i used one pair when washing my pots and pans with pure hot water no heat on my hands one pair when cleaning the bathroom they are great multi use gloves its also great to wear when spray painting  i usually end up with paint all over my fingers and its hard to remove so smart to wear these
i am a repeat buyer of this great product
i read the reviews and decided to give this laundry detergent a try its everything it does make your sheets and towel smell light a luxury hotel it way too expensive to use for all my laundry although it would be divine if i could use it for all my lingerie but that would become yet another expensive habit after a week in the linen closet i can still detect that light luxurious scent it is not overwhelming its that i have money cant you detect it by how good my linens smell scent not perfumey just delightful and makes you want to sniff more so glad to have stumbled up this i love it
i actually like the product just that i spent a fortune for a pound 16 oz and got shorted a 14 pound i weighed on a food scale  dont say you are shipping a pound and short me  that included the packaging by the way  i should have gotten a pound of charcoal independent of the packaging  i really got 11 ounces the packaging weighed an ounce or so
i really like this great concept
however they get a little slippery when they get wet and you have to hold them in place other than that they do their job
functions well
i love how this is a wearable breast pump my daughter in law can discreetly extract breadt milk wherever she is at its comfortable to use and doesnt pinch or hurt its easy to use and is an affordable way of making sure that my grandchildren get the breast milk they need great value
just started using this stuff and love it already  besides feeling good it definitely soothes the aches and pains that i have with my feet and ankles also my husband is diabetic and has feet that crack and split  this worked wonders for him will definitely keep buying it
this massager brush cleans scalp effectively and makes your head feel great when you use it the bristles are very soft and easy to clean you can use it on any hair length or texture youll feel like youre getting a special scalp treatment at home i highly recommend this productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
worked as expected
battery life is very short and there is not enough torque to really get in there and clean it went in the garbage after the battery died and would not charge 2 weeks
love this stuff  gets any baby stain out as long as you spray and let it soak in  i mean anythingpoo spit up food etc
excellent value for money stretches well very comfortable to use during day or night
this wrapping paper is great quality and super cute
it is hard to do a review without doing a chemical analysis test i trust what it says on the label and the price was decent
i had to stop taking it  had reaction like i do when fillers are used
i use this product for diabetis problems and it works very well as expected the delivery was pretty quick as well will definitely order from this seller again
they seem okaybut they are far too small what the blurb fails to mention is that these sleeves are for women not men ie they are for thinner arms the packaging shows women wearing them but none of these hints are shown here they are far too small for me to even get them on
trying to find an eyeglass holder for a man was unattainable until now  everywhere we looked all the eyeglass holder were for women dainty beads etc  these are leather and high quality  they were easy to attach to the glasses and were adjustable to the width of the frame  great product and you cant beat the price for three of these in one package
easy to take and a very nonoffensive taste the product is in a glass amber bottle and has a rubber squeezy i take daily for hair growth and internal ligament protection
these compression socks are comfortable  i have worn 3 so far in 3 days  because of their comfortable softness and easily stretched i am hoping they will last a satisfactory length of time

i searched for the best fish oil that was easy enough to use i actually put it into my morning smoothly  as i really dont see any difference i am hoping behind the scenes its working
good product
this sandalwood essential oil smells great i put a little bit of this in my diffuser and my house smells great it didnt take much for this to spread through my whole housethe pack comes with 338 fluid ounces of sandalwood essential oil it also comes with a dropper  there are ways to use the essential oil on the side of the bottlei will be recommending this sandalwood essential oil to family and friends
priced right
keeps the weight for a few seconds after you step off love it
got this today and the instructions state to pour the powder into your mouth but gosh its absolutely awful  due to it being fish collagen the fish taste is definitely there and the socalled green apple flavor isnt  i could barely finish the packet i will try to add this to some orange juice to cut the flavori will update this review if i notice any difference
great overall but i would prefer if they have the braided chain to prevent leaks
my skin is sentive skin  after use this facial brush i feel its very harsh for my skin
love em go bears got son a set too
i love the taste of these
this novelty eyeglass stand was heavier and more sturdy than i thought it would be  it was adorable and was perfect for a family member who is a huge westie fan  i was quite pleased with the purchase and would recommend to others
i can stand on this scale in 10 different places around my house and get 10 completely different weights  i have no clue how much i weigh with this scale  cheap and not worth it  spend a little more money and get something that works
i love this works great
larger than expected but it will be used
the comb attachments to my hair dryer broke i ordered these and they fit perfectly
a very good brand were buying more and more under this brand

these are nice and sturdy bags with tie handles which is important to mei put them in our bedrooms offices and bathrooms  i also have on in our garage for our kitty litter scooping bagthey are strong  after a week of scooping kitty litter 2 times a day i just yanked that bag out of the can on trash day without even thinking about it and it didnt stretch or tear  i was using another eco friendly bag for the kitty stuff and a few times it did tear  these have no scent and fit perfectly in those smaller trash cans like bathroom offices etc  its a good and sturdy bag that works
these masks are great  comfortable and thick we like this brand and the shipping was very fast
love the price i use this in every diaper change for my baby to prevent diaper rash hes been having an intolerance to certain things in my diet and while im trying to figure out what the intolerance is to one of the symptoms for him is consistent diaper rash i almost gave up on breastfeeding because of all the complications and the diaper rash just drew the line for me a friend mentioned to use petroleum jelly if it wasnt for this i wouldve been going crazy and so would my baby
this is the best foot file i have ever used highly recommend
i really enjoy the wand  it seems to give relief for awhile plus it has other attachments
what can i say  it does the job
they are a great fit for the lager shark head attachment which are also harder to find
have bought the brush picks before and used them for many years  the holder is great to use when traveling
fresh light and almost nutty tasting  did not activate my gag reflex and mine is sensitive to overactivating  im using this for morning swishing as a daily oral hygiene habit instead of oil pulling with coconut or sesame which texturewise never worked well for me  it helps to have a tongue scraper if going with this method
i have dry mouth i had tried the more commonly found one but it tasted downright nasty found this natural dentist brand for dry mouth which has all natural ingredients no preservatives or artificial coloring in it they used to have a cool mint flavor but apparently discontinued it because i cant find it online or anywhere anymore so tried this it still works great and is the natural product but the taste is not as refreshing as the cool mint
solid preworkout taken many many pres during my time hands down one of the best must try

rim is not padded  should have bought higher quality
changed my life in a very positive way
these saved my gallbladder i took them until all symptoms cleared had my gallbladder checked and i was stone free then i had another baby and for some reason my gallbladder likes to make stones during this time didnt have issues right after the birth but began having issues again and started up on these and had helped tremendously nothing else has worked like this for me my naturopathic doctor got me turned on to these and im very grateful
great quality fair price i purchased this brand and style over others brands and even amongst the other offerings within carlson based on price and nutrient content per serving this one rated best for me  i began taking about a tablespoon each evening at dinner to help with high cholesterol numbers within a few months the next reading was perfect my health team was impressed and highfived me ill have another reading done in maygood taste no fishy burps and i feel good taking it i will buy from this company again
i really liked these when i first used them especially being able to see so well through the little holes but i began to wonder if i was going to tan wierd around my eyes  they seem to use up a little more space than regular tanning bed glasses  i also found that they tear really easy which is not a huge deal since so many come on a roll  i didnt continue to use them so i never got a certain answer on the raccoon opposite eye thing but if the glasses really bother you i would certainly recommend these
fantastic product this pill case is really good for people who need vitamins or medications 7 days a week the bags are large enough to accommodate my medications and multiple vitamins labels on the compartment are large and easy to read great for travel too a must for travelers
used in coconut carrier oil for psoriasis didnt seem to help but great for other things im sure
took some use getting use to the routine of taking every night but now that i have it down i will always take it definitely regulated my system
this jinri hair dryer is among one of the best i have ever owned strong and powerful my hair dries super quick it has varying speeds and heat levels which allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time it also fits well in my hand is relatively light weight and i can maneuver from the front to back of my head easily i love this red color as well and it matches my decor perfectly highly recommend if you are in the market for a new quality hair dryer at a reasonable price

i could still hear loud snoring and even though i squished the ear plugs to fit my ears since i have smaller ears it didnt feel comfortable and the sounds came through too strongly no matter what the volume  0
perseveranx shoe insertsthe shoe inserts arrived in a plain pink box and included no instructions not that instructions are specifically needed but i found it kind of odd there was nothing but the box and the pads there are enough for two pairs of shoes upon seeing the thickness i was afraid they would make my shoes too tight i was pleasantly surprised when i put on my shoes and they felt comfortable a little tighter but still comfortable the information provided on the product page does warn that the inserts will take up some space in your shoes and recommends buying up a shoe size this isnt going to help if you already have the shoesthe inserts do exactly what they claim to do in that they relieve some of the discomfort to my feet when i wear high heels i didnt notice that my feet were any hotter or sweatier than they would have been without the inserts it was a very warm day my only complaint is that with opensided shoes the blue foam shows im not sure how long the cushioning effect will last until the pads have to be replaced but so far so good
this is prescription strength fish oil my husband and i take it for bad cholesterol awsome product 
exactly what i needed and worked great
comfortable to wear  it helps my posture in a comfortable way
this portable sound machine has a variety of sound options you can set the noise level and also choose how long for the effect to play you can set it for a half hour an hour etc i do find it relaxing as background noise when i am reading in bed or just wanting to destress while doing household chores
im really surprised at the affordable price of these considering how wonderful they are they get out even the toughest stains dont cause any skin irritation i have sensitive skin and smell really goodi have a large capacity washing machine and at most i only need to use two of these per cycle i love how bright the colors and whites come out i got this small bag to test them out but ill definitely be purchasing a larger quantity when i run out
works exactly as designed
i dont use this consistently but havent noticed much results yet
will make the cutest halloween items imlooking forwards to using them
my usually very happy 1 year old had a fever and hated our old thermometer used in the armpitthe pediatrician told me that at this age she should use the ear thermometer for the best accuracy so we got this one its so easy to use i wonder why we ever used anything else the doctor said to pull on her outer ear a bit and point toward her cheekbone angled towards the front and slightly up  not only was the reading accurate but it was so fast that i didnt have to worry about my daughter getting squirmy at allbonus is that my trekkie husband calls it a phaser and he and my daughter have a lot of fun using it
my husbands therapist requested this to work on his balance because he has parkinsons  works as intended
yes im so happy that this product is finally available great taste great company awesome stuff it has a cool green color but it mixes well into my normal morning smoothies so im super happy with it thanks
garbage my kid felt hot to the touch this thermometer used on his forehead showed 977 degrees ear showed 982 didnt seem correct so took temp rectally and it was 102
awesome product
wife crushed her l1 vertebrae and uses this to bring relief works fine
did the job definitely remember  dry fingers only when pulling out the soap sheets for a pair of washable black trousers i had to use two sheets but they came clean in the hotel sink
i am just getting over the worst hemorrhoids of my life i have had them a few times in the past but nothing like this time the itching  burning was excruciating this has been quite helpful this fits on the toilet without any problems its deep enough that you can add enough water to actually sit in it collapses flat for storing this is just the seat and does not come with any hose or spray attachment i found that i didnt need that and this was more than sufficient
i loathe when using a disposable handtowelwashcloth and it falls apart in your hands  yuck this will never happen with this product this is very substantial and not like the flimsy ornamental handtowelwashcloths you find in many guest bathrooms  all show and no substance these cloths feel rich and substantial and completely absorb the water after washing your hands
thank you for quick delivery nice producthopefully will last long
daughter lives the entire package great for a new surfer glides in easily and smells like a great day at the beach
i have take a different brand for year and though i would try a different brand this brand to me has an odd taste i will not buy again
this fits really well the quality is pretty good
ive been experiencing a lot of neck pain lately and was excited to try this tens machine to see if it would help  i am happy to report that it feels great and my neck feels better during treatment and for a few hours after treatment  i use this machine most frequently at night a couple of hours before bed  it feels great on my muscles and provides pain relief  im trying to avoid using medicinal pain relievers  my doctor said that i have a bit of arthritis in my neck and that poor posture is exacerbating the pain  ive been trying to be more aware of my posture and while that helps this tens machine provides extra relief on bad pain daysi found this machine easy to set up and begin using  the manual made little sense to me though and i had to figure out how to set it up on my own  i used a tens machine many years ago so i had a base of past knowledge to understand the set up but its not enough for people new to these machines  as of the time of writing this review the manufacturer has added a video showing how to set up the device  i wish the video contained verbal or captioned instructions  its just music now so if the manufacturer is reading these reviews please add caption to the video
fast shipping good flavor especially with almond milk
i bought these for our churchi like them a lot but they should come with more than one key
i tried out more expensive products and this one works just as well the only thing that is kind of annoying is that it changes directions of the movement every 60 seconds without you telling it to heat works great overall really great product
this is awesome great value why pay more i do wish it could run on batteries however i love that it has a car adapter i wish the house cord was slightly longer
i like the fact this product came very fastalso seems to be a good productno problems at all
it always irked me that i squeeze as much toothpaste out as possible but theres so much left that goes to waste these little things are great for getting almost all of it out not just for toothpaste i also use them on other squeezable tubes easy to use just slip it on the post  begin to roll i must reorder because i need more of them

unfortunately i was not thorough enough in my research and discovered after purchasing it that it causes you not to be able to absorb thiamine as efficiently  i already take a thiamine supplement so i discontinued using this
this germguardian gg1000 pluggable uvc sanitizer and deodorizer seems to be a designer model of the  that ive used successfully for a couple of years  the pluggable guardian air purifiers do remove most of the kitchen cooking odors tiny grease globules in particular that escape the air guard feature on my oventhis shapely air purifier runs more quietly than my rectangular version though motor noise may be determined by the motor in individual devices  the motor was louder in my second rectangular device than it was in the first  the fans run constantly in these air purifiers but they dont seem to require a lot of electricitythe air purifier will operate in the up down or sideways position so you dont need to be concerned about the orientation of your household electrical outlets  the purifier plug does not have a third prong for grounding though it has wide and narrow prongs like most modern safety plugs  the purifier covers only one outlet in a twoplug wall outlet so the second outlet remains available for general usemy first pluggable germguardian lasted well beyond the oneyear warranty period  these little air purifiers dont seem to require maintenance beyond replacing the uv bulb when it burns out the blue light on the purifier will go out  the bulbs are easy to replace but you should never look directly at a pluggedin uv bulb with the purifier cover open because this can permanently damage your eyes
i love this thing  it is easy to peddle and  you can set it up anywhere in the house  you can watch tv or read a book while you peddle  it is quiet and does not squeak  it is not real heavy so you can quickly and easily move it to clean around it  i put it on a rubber back rug so that it would not move on the hardwood floor while i peddled and i would suggest the same  it will move away from you while you peddle if it is on hardwood
this is a great flat iron it has some weight so it feels great pulling hair through it it heats up quickly and the end  has rubber to protect your fingertips leaves hair nice and silky so glad i hought this
ok so i am super depressed at the moment and it is difficult to get myself on the mat and nearly impossible to get myself to clean it that being said once i finally mustered up the energy to clean my mat after probably 3 months i was so pleasantly surprised at the smell its a beautiful lavender scent and it lifted my spirits immediately and it cleans very well  so much dirt came off this is definitely worth the price thanks
to be honest i have never seen such a large bottle of sandalwood oil before most of the time ive had to make due with a diluted product because santalum album is dreadfully expensive most of the timethis sandalwood oil has a nice warmth to it and you can diffuse it alone or with some vanilla essential oil for a very relaxing fragrancethis arrives in a nice box with a solid lid on it so it doesnt spill and it also has a dropper which i immediately installed for ease of usei feel lucky to have found this as i use sandalwood quite a bit in my diffuser to help me relax in the eveningsthe rebecca review
the bristles are so soft great for a gentle exfoliation
such a soft and silky pillow case  it is satin and will not slip off with the hidden zipper i used it to take a nap and i slept like a baby  my long hair was not all messed up eitherso luxurious and a premium quality pillow casei would also like to say that whenever i provide any reviews i always take my time and make sure i understand and have used the product in order to give an educated review as an amazon customer i know how annoying and difficult it is when reviewers cant be trusted its important to note here that i received this product at discounted price for my honest and unbiased review still i try my best to provide all the useful details in the review rather than misrepresenting a products quality in order to please a seller and i know good sellers always look for true feedback at last if my review ishelpful for you please press the vote button to provide your feedback thank you
ive bought a lot of supplements and usually you cant tell if its working or doing you any good  this is not one of those supplements it helps you completely empty your bowels  i was amazed as ive struggled with ibs for 20 years and this was the one supplement that really helped mesadly its been out of stock for a long time  and i broke down and ordered the same supplement from a different company and it was a total waste of money  it just cant compare to this brandplease bring it back soon 
some replacements just arent quite oem these are as close to the oem fit as ive foundas advertised quite satisfied

this is the 31st bp monitor that i have tried and ordered through amazon either via purchase or the vine program and is a basic monitor almost every single monitor takes my bp within a few points of each other and this ones accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range this one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user note that i did not take 180 readings so this is unverified after the reading it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse it averages the bp after three successful bp readings but the average recall is not marked as an average most monitors identify an average with the avg notation it has an irregular heartbeat indicator  there is one large cuff provided that will fit most people there are two power options available and included and that is four aaa batteries or via a usb type c cable time settings are in the 24hour clock military time only voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy chinese accentincluded in the package one bp unit one bp user manual and one digital pamphlet one large cuff one carry pouch one usb type c cable and 4 aaa batteriesfeatures up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory date and time settings are available in 24hour clock only setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual the lcd display readout is large for easy reading the cuff is 22 to 42 cm 866 to 16535 inches which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese clearing all the bp settings is just a matter of holding the mem button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until all ee appears the display is large accuracy is errs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors press and hold the set button when power is off wait until the user indicator blinks and then press mem to switch to the other user it displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such the date and time settings are not remembered after the power is removed but the bp numbers are remembered   i tested after one minute of battery removal it has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female chinese accent it has an irregular heartbeat indicatornegatives the accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5star monitors the average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the avg indicator the voice option is moderated by a heavy female chinese accentthis is an acceptable bp monitor operation and setup of this unit is simple once i read the manual to take my blood pressure i affixed the cuff around my left arm with my palm turned up i made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor then i pressed start and after a little bit i had my reading i pressed stop to turn off the unit the systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed the big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range and the cuff is thinblood pressure is never the same from moment to moment so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes it is important for a user to learn how to take their bp to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when in fact it is user error there are many great videos online that can help teach thisin summary this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual the cuff is large enough for most people and the lcd display is large and easy to read it displays an avg after three readings but that is not marked the voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented theres an irregular heartbeat indicator  the current price is not listed but any price at 24 or below would be reasonable for thisfor those who are interested i attached some notes about the other monitors i have tried  this is known as the gold standard of bp monitors and one i purchased a few months ago on amazon it stores 100 readings between 2 users unfortunately it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an ac adapter can be purchased separately i love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most    this is the monitor i use most often in the winter so i do not have to disrobe to expose my arm it stores 120 readings between 2 users it is great for portability comes with a hard case and is battery operated only in addition it has cp g correct position guidance to ensure the user does not make an error that only works if it is turned on   this is great if a talking monitor in both english and spanish is needed it stores 120 readings between 2 users in addition to battery operation it comes with an ac adapter two very flimsy cuffs and a case if the cuffs were better this would be my favorite arm monitor    super basic only stores 15 numbers in memory for one user without any date and time theres no case and it is battery operated only   this is good if storage for 4 family members is needed it comes with a carrying case and it is battery operated only   the monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each only a standard cuff is supplied  the cuff cable is short the two power options available are 4 aa batteries or microusb cable not supplied   the monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each theres also an alarm feature a largersized standard cuff is supplied but the cuff cable is short the two power options available are 4 aa batteries or micro usb neither is supplied 35 stars  this is a decent monitor with a large cuff so larger individuals can use it it is only battery operated via 4 aaa batteries and only has one user mode with 99 memory points the biggest negative is the european date and time 35 stars this is a great monitor with a large cuff two power sources 4 aaa batteries or ac cable and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each 45 stars  the monitor is for 2 users w90 readings each it has a large cuff and two power sources 4 aaa batteries or ac cable the drawbacks are that i could not get the monitor to pair with the app with bluetooth on and the angle of the display makes it difficult to read unless it is tilted back also the time is only displayed as a 24hour clock   the monitor is for 2 users w250 readings each it has a large cuff with a cord that is just a tad shorter than other monitors i tried there is one power source included 4 aaa batteries there is also a connection for ac cord but that must be purchased separately the lcd display is large

which is set by default time setting is military time only   this monitor has four user modes w240 readings per user the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone this can be powered by four aa

large for easy reading   this monitor has two user modes with 60 readings per user the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone this can be powered by the two included aaa batteries the led is large and the unit is simple to use and operate unfortunately the bp is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number systolic pressure and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number diastolic pressure mostly due to the unitcuff design that does not allow for a secure fit  the respiration number is accurate however    this monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone this can be powered by four aaa batteries included or included usb cable no ac adapter the display is large for easy reading time is in military time only

with 99 readings per user the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone this can be powered by two aaa batteries not included the led is large and the unit is simple to use and operate theres also a voice assist option unfortunately the bp is around 10 points lower than it should be for the top number systolic pressure and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number diastolic pressure the closer the user holds the arm to heart level the less the inaccuracy but it is still not as good as the gold standard  the respiration number is accurate however   this monitor has two user modes with 120 readings per user this monitor is very basic as it does not have an average or irregular heartbeat feature the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone this can be powered by four aaa batteries

it has been do difficult to get the insides of the carafe clean when all that i can reach inside with is a bottle brush i followed the instructions and was able to remove most of the stains except where the bottle brush cant reach on the upper inside edge

i have used all sorts of duracell brand batteries for years and never had a problem with any of them they have always lasted a long time in whatever device i needed them for and they also have a long shelf life ive had them in the package for years before using and they were still very good these are so much better than any chinese or knockoff battery ive tried to use
why i didnt purchase one of these till now is beyond me seriously this is definitely a purchase im proud of and anyone blowing up a bunch of balloons the old fashion way needs to just take the leap and get one i still havent figured out how to use the balloon tie plastic finger thing but im sure there is a youtube video out there

this is a vegan friendly toothpaste with a mildly minty flavor that is reminiscent of peppermint the mildness means it doesnt have the sting that some other brands have this may also help prevent sensitivity issues that occur with other whitening toothpastesas for the actual whitening qualities after using it for a week 2x daily ive noticed slight whitening effects but nothing dramaticit does leave your mouth feeling fresh after brushing however and my teeth feel smooth after brushingthe active ingredient is sodium fluoride at 024 which is exactly the amount in other toothpastes i compared it toon another note there is a considerable amount of air in the tube so it takes a little pressure to release that first squirtoverall id say this is a decent toothpaste that is mild and whitens slightly but its also pricey and not much different than any drugstore brand of whitening toothpaste
i just got this scale today  it is easy to use and gave me an accurate weight count i would love to buy another to keep around the house for my family to use

exactly what i needed for open toe ankle heels they stick well but are very soft
no body wants to receive something dirty or broken for something this personal it has a strong oder and the hole at the top isnt even big enough for the tip for a proper seal i have terrible bowel problems and im constantly having to buy 95 cent enemas and honestly they are better than this
works great came quick love it great color
i have had this for while and wasnt sure  about its best use but i found it  this essential oil roll on works great on itchy bug bites or other skin irritation  i had a rather large welt from a bug bite one day itchy and irritated and decided to use this on it and the itch went away right away and the next day the welt and any trace of the bite was gone  smells so nice too
have have taken almost 2 months of this product now and there is absolutely no difference in my tinnitus save your money
this is a great product for my long hair nothing else works for me thank god i found it on amazon
i do not notice any difference when i take this product the taste is ok
works fantastic
i was using white vinegar to clean my dishwasher cheaper right vinegar is used for a lot of other good things but it can cause damage  void your warranty these tablets do what they are intended to do clean a dishwasher with excellent results while leaving a pleasant odor which vinegar does not i use these tablets when the dishwasher is empty as recommended other brands state that their tablets can be added to a full load of dishes while being cleaned
the most important thing to remember is that these wont be a miracle cure if you always eat deadmanufactured food  if you eat real food i think these can be restorative if youve been recently forced to take antibiotics or if you are otherwise 34out of whack34  start feeding your microbiome through these and natural living and lets stop the spread of western diseases
cooking and refreshing isnt the most absorbent but it is a liner and not a full pad i love these they tend to help relive my cramps to some extent
tastes pretty good but arrived melted and discolored also i did not realize they were fruit flavored
as the headline stated after taking it while eating i felt less bloated stomach and face afterwards you do feel more attentive and energetic but more focused will be buying a bigger bottle later on used it for 1 month my only recommendation is take it with something food or if its mid day a tiny snack not just liquids due causing an upset stomach its not painful or bothersome it just feels warm
works great just wish the tube was more full so it could last a little longer
these are soft and really makes you feel good even when scrubbing hard i will say its cheaper to buy them in the store though
i have to admit i was a tad skeptical when i bought this product in my experience a bunch of 5 star reviews can either mean the product is great or horrible there is no middle ground for me well with this product it definitely lives up to the hype i have had ingrown hairs in the past along with razor burn and the terrible 34after itch34 from shaving this product wipes out all of thatthis product does not foam and is more 34milky34 than 34foamy34 a little goes a long way and it left my skin feeling amazing i use this product every literally and it did not irritate my skin or cause me issuei highly recommend this product
works well and ease to use
its pretty good so far  unfortunately due to the short handle i can only use it on my neck can almost reach my lower back painit seems to have good power  for professional use by a barberhairdresser im sure it would be great i just wish i had a significant other to use it on me
total junk plus size they sent could have fit goliath i made an adaption to make smaller still a huge waste of money
like the textures and flavors
the soap the box it comes in and the package it was shipped in were all covered in flakes of soap the box was falling apart i had to put the bars in ziplock bags to store it i certainly wouldnt gift it to anyone i dont know if it is normal for it to be covered in the flakes or not but it certainly wasnt what i thought i would get
this lotion completely dried my skin out the more i applied the drier it became
ordered wrong kind didnt work as prescribed use was to be
i work nights and sleep days so it is hard to sleep when the sun is up even with light blocking drapes i have used silk masks but they feel weird and one size does not fit all comfortablythe eye cups make it easier for the mask to rest on my face comfortably the adjudtable band is neat had a sinus headache the first sleep so i had it loose made a world of difference i even took a nap yesterday and just laid it across my eyes and due to the eye cups it didnt fall off well until i rolled over lolgood investment happy so far
very quiet definately cleans the air
ordered incorrect size learning process
nice tight fit and good optical clarity perfect for motorcycle riding as they offer complete sealing all around my eyes and the built in readers are a nice convenience
i threw them away
my favorite tissues  i prefer these small cubes to the larger boxes
plastic pieces made this difficult to use very cheaply made
makes mask wearing much more comfortable for me wore on a plane for several hours and practically forgot i had it on you need to pull the mask down well over your chin then it doesnt move when you breathe or talkthere are better ones though these dont clip onto the mask you just shove them under it the clipons are more convenient especially if you take your mask on and off a lot
i bought these magnifying lenses which fit comfortably on the head and even over conventional glasses thinking i would use them occasionally for painting details  but i discovered they are incredibly versatile  great for any sort of close work  need to remove a splinter trim an ingrown toenail examine an object for small cracks or defects check your cats ears do some delicate beadwork or sewing or read that fine print on the medicine bottle  this will make your life ever so much easier  i never dreamed how many applications there are in which it is useful to have enhanced vision  i keep it right by my desk and probably use it several times a day  very useful and highly recommended even if you have good eyesight  i never realized how much i was missing
easy to install  easy to remove
treated my tank with this good results
i love soothing wellness essentials carrying cases i first purchased the one that holds 96 and liked it so much i got the larger one too the inserts protect the oils and i like that it has pockets inside the top the case is so easy to carry and store looks fantastic
this mask is comfortable enough but is not opaque the fabric blocks maybe 80 of the light in a sunlit room which is not enough for me to sleep well in a brightly lit space
these smelled like gasoline even after washing horrible soap didnt suds up inside disappointing
no fragrance at all and they are tiny
this is more like rubber and not like a sponge at all i didnt really like it for doing dishes or much of anything really
how this fits into your life depends on what you need it still requires some water and still requires toweling off it basically replaces the need to have a separate low suds cleansing formula and wash rag or dry cloth this is rinse free but you do need water to start  just add a little water to the sheet of fabric massage for light lather wipe down body then towel off no need to rinse keep in mind that the more water that is used the more the mess from run offthe sheet of fabric is like a soft piece of felt size of a large washcloth 95 x 95 dont need much water it definitely lathers it isnt a sudsy soap but that doesnt mean there isnt enough  now if you are expecting loads of foamy bubbles this does not provide that it creates a light watery lather this in no way determines effectiveness of cleaning mega lather does not equate better cleaning i learned that 30 some years ago in home economics that excess lather is a marketing technique usually through copious amounts of sulphates to give people impression that more latherbubblessuds  better clean shampoo body soaps toothpaste but for those that dig the suds i can get some light bubbles out of it that being said it is adequate enough not super refreshing but i do feel clean tried it in hair with fair resultsthis could be cut in half and it would still have plenty of lather depending on your situation this could be premoistened and placed in a ziplock baggieno discernable aroma not sticky at least not me i wonder if amount of water used or thoroughness of toweling off impacts that or notpersonally i prefer wet body wipes they never need water nor toweling off i like those for on the go use workday after work out bird bath at the sink i would be more apt to use these in a bed bound situation or no hot water situation maybe campingthe term waterless needs to be taken out from the title headline that is a traffic directing manipulation and it helps no one especially if they buy something like this without further looking at the product pictures and description
love that it has the clip catcher  no more having to go outside or over the bathroom sink when clipping my nails
includes a bottle brush for cleaning  has a comfortable rubber seal that makes a good seal this is great for an emergency
from what i have noticed these fit most of my heels and seem to work well
i have used these for about 2 months now and i  really like them i have had a torn  rotator cuff and these help some with the pain as well as some exercise to keep it fluid i just do not want surgery as i know of a friend of mine who had the rotator operated on and it really did not help i will keep taking these and see in another month how i do ill come back and update then
i have been doing a lot of physical work and i get sore from the heavy lifting this helps this also replenishes my endurance so i can do more work the taste isnt bad and you will need to blend to get the best mix i mix up a glass and take a nice sip throughout the working
very fine powder no taste blends well in smoothies  this will last a long time since the serving size is small
pretty good helps keep my sanity when i get hungry before my main meal  i think it makes for a quick snack either to take care of a sweet tooth need or just need something to nosh on to take care of hungries before next meal when i am on the go all day i often dont eat anything until dinner im just not hungry and copious amounts of coffee andor a smoothie takes care of my need to masticate a meal but sometimes i do get a little hungry ok sometimes a lot lol  i pack some snack bars just in case but sometimes i want a better mouth feeldifferent texture than what a dry bar provides so give me cheese stick olives meat stick and now these yam sticks of all the other options these are the easiest for me as they are room temperature stable now i can have one of these and maybe a handful of nuts and i am satisfied enough to hold off until dinnerhas a light mild taste i think kids would like this as it isnt as strong as some sweet potatoes i know some of the flavor is dependent on the type of sweet potatoyam used and region that is the extent of my expertise though haha the texture is decent it is a soft with a little bit of chew easy to eat i have another yam product i prefer about as mild but little more chew but i would totally buy these again if only because i can control myself better this is 80 calories per stick where as the other is a bag at 180 per servingbag not bad but i dont always need that much at once but i cant control myself haha so different items purchased for different reasons if you want to get fancy this would be delightful paired with a slice of turkey or chicken then maybe a slice of cheese all rolled in a small soft tortilla shell or ditch the meat and add in avocado hmm making myself hungry nowyammy httpswwwamazoncomdpb08sybssn3
i think this dreft detergent is great i love the smell and it really does make the clothes soft and smell great i like the new box it has an easy to use spout
good quality loofah works very well with body washes or bar soap does an outstanding job of exfoliating skin in the shower without causing any abrasions or marks shipped quickly and securely no problems at all from placing order to using product will buy again when i need them
decent quality but ill stick with huggies wipes
not fancy but they do the trick  the foam pad isnt porous so you dont have to worry about it soaking up your lotion  i dont have any issues reaching with it but i can see how some people might  overall im happy with these
these are ok fiber gummies each serving provides 5g of fiber which is decent but not outstanding additionally a serving consists of three gummies so a bottle of 60 will last only 20 days the taste is fine sort of a berryish flavor mostly but theres 3g of added sugar per serving sugar is the second most common ingredient which is rather high the consistency is firm bordering on rubbery and it sticks to my teeth which is annoyingthe fiber is from chicory root which is the usual goto source for fiber in gummies it uses natural flavors and natural colors which is a plus  the country of manufacture is not listed on the bottle which can mean that its not made in the usweighing all the factors taste formulation serving size cost ease of use puts my rating at three stars average its not a bad fiber gummy but its not outstanding compared with other similar options that are available
an ounce of protection will save thousands of dollars in duisand possibly lives i am not a drinker but i do occasionally imbibe on special occasions i like that this oasser breathalyzer breath tester comes with a window punch so its good to keep in your car just in case
i just used it for the first time on a 12 x 3 section of vinyl siding above my back patio it used to take me 30 minutes with a step ladder and a sponge to clean the mildew off these vinyl panels today i did it in less than 5 minutes using my docapole 6inch scrub brush with extension pole and i didnt need a ladder next i tackled the difficult job of cleaning mildew from the area around the attic vent at the point of my house which is 35 high i was able to effectively clean this hard to reach area using a 22 ladder and the 12 docapole extension and scrub brush previously i was never able to clean this area around my houses attic vent now its mildew free and i have  the tool to keep it clean in the future this is a marvelous item of equipment its lightweight and easy to maneuver the scrub brush does a terrific job of cleaning mildew off of vinyl siding i highly recommend it
i normally use a fairly stiff soapy back brush in the shower i want to feel like my back area is being cleaned and exfoliated this is like trying to scrub your back with a rubbery belt  theres no exfoliation and its bristles are too soft and ineffective
was it really necessary to use a photo for this product featuring a woman gleefully waving doughnuts at the camera  i realize this is a product targeted to plus size women but the doughnuts image  is stereotypical and offensive  that being said the product works well enough for what i wanted  but please just use a photo of a woman modeling the arm bands and lose the doughnuts
it was a nice bathbomb however when it arrived it was broken
i have a leather club chair that i just love i also have five dogs one of whom is a big active pittie who loves that chair she sits in it all day to look outside she also takes running leaps into the chair which causes it to careen across the room into the wall just about every time the leather was getting scratched and borderline cracked like if i hadnt done something to those cracks forming the leather would have just split open in a bunch of placesfirst i wiped the chair down with a clean wet rag then i took a little bit of this in my hands and warmed it up then i applied it with my hands all over the leather i rubbed it in thoroughly and after 1520 minutes i bugged it with a clean dry cloth omg it looks amazing you can still see the almost crack but now that it isnt all dried out anymore it just looks worn in and distressed but no longer trashedi definitely recommend this stuff it was so quick and easy to apply with just my hands and it only takes a teeny tiny amount so this will last forever im about to go condition my timberland boots with it right now and cant wait to see the results that same dog has trashed my boots  i wont even tell you what she did to those because ick side note that same dog licked the chair after i was done and she is still with us so its a very dog friendlysafe product
it is a beautiful bracelet and fits my small wrist shiney and not tarnished  very happy and thank you for having this size perfect
love it i sit at my home office all day and its made a huge difference
i looked at a lot of canes prior to purchasing this one the bells  whistles were a little over the top in the beginning but became quite functional useful and helpful there isnt a better cane out there for the price my only wish would be to offset the handle to make it a little more comfortable over a long period of time
i almost always buy recycled andor environmentally correct tissues but when my whole family gets a cold we end up with at least two boxes of these having the skin peel off your nose and upper lip just plain stinks
this product is ok but would recommend getting a much larger size
too expensive
i like the bulk concept and so far the product seems comparable to past products ive used that cost more so im sold 
i love the disposable eye steam masks they are so great for dry eyes i like having an electric version that i can use for much longer sometimes i use this over wet cotton flats for even better results same with under eye gel pads the heat really helps the serums absorb there are 4 heat levels and 4 time options the longest is 30 minutes great to relax you for sleep or a amid afternoon break when your eyes are tired from the computer screen the lavender part comes separately you can  insert it if you want to use itthe heated part is inserted into the sleep mask or can be removed from the sleep mask there is also a cold pack that can be inserted as well or it can be used as a regular sleep mask
i ordered this brand when i couldnt get my regular brand which i still prefer but this was an ok substitute
my sun likes it easy to handle and the floss is not too thickthin i wish there was no fruity scent to it but i can live with that 5 stars
great stuffthe only fish oil that significantly lowered my cholesteroltrig levels within a couple of months  alsono nasty fish burping taste  the only way to go
in the picture this foot soaking bucket seems fine and in many ways it is however in practical use the main flaws inherent in its cheap construction become readily apparent the soaking pail is made of cheap thin pliable plastic the problem is that under the best circumstances the plastic soaking pail deforms  elongates once filled with water for your foot soakwhats even worse if you are hankering for a warm foot soak then you are in a bit of hot water as hot water makes this cheap plastic deform even more the sort of square configuration of the soaking pail wants to become an oval the handles stay secure to the pail but feel suspect  beyond that the soaking pail is fine it has enough space for my big size 12 feet im only 5 feet 7 inches tall i think god initially wanted to make me taller but he ran out of funding so i was topped out much soonerall in all id say this foot soaking solution is adequate but nothing to write home about i dont hate it but im always afraid the handles might fail under the load of carrying warm soaking water i only took off only one star because my foot soak bucket has never failed so thats something
great supplement
an awesome product this helped with itchy back due to insect bites and stress induced allergic skin rashes due to the loss of a family member i brought this because i needed an aloe spray product from a respectable company like johnson  johnson also i brought this since there are days in which i dont see my man but need aloe lotionaloe oil applied on my back so i dont go crazy with itchy sensations this mist did the trick and smells lightly too it does spray about so one has to be careful with this it is easy to hold and spray though compare to other mists ive used to relieve my itchy back i guess johnson  johnson were sensitive towards customers with smaller hands with arthritis or children who want to be grownups and have their own spray mist anyways i highly recommend this for dry itchy skin and especially relieve insect bites and stress induced rashes great spray for those hard to reach places i feel so much better
arrived fast tried once and it worked well easy to clean and each part is good still i give it only three star 25 i wish since the product obviously looks like a used one the print on the button is scratched and blurred how do i add my picture to the review i just hope the shaving head has not been used on other people is it amazon or the sellers problemupdateafter 6 months of use at the frequency of twice per week one shaving petal fell off while i was cleaning it carefully poor quality had to buy another one of a different brand
it worked the problem was my tooth wouldnt hold for more than a day but for that one day it was helpful  i did get to feel confident in fro t of guests
worked great  would recommend this
this is the only manufacturer that i have found that carries these larger interdental brushes  they are necessary for my dental hygiene
cant smell the scent
i tried using these in some new work boots while the back is fairly tacky they just dont feel very good and dont do a good job at keeping my foot in place after only a few hours of use they became loose and started to roll onto itself once it does that they are very difficult to get it to unstick from itself without tearing the pad i would have returned them but frankly it just wasnt worth the effort
i like the easy and quick pouring sprout the attach measuring cup is easy and good
these say that theyre new and oem but they cut like theyve been poorly refurbished  not impressed and will not buy again
they arent exactly bad tasting  but they are very strange  its like eating peas that have the same texture of matzo crackers  its messing with my mind and taste buds because i keep expecting to taste chips not peas  maybe they will grow on me
needed these for a state fair project and they were perfect
it works for me i only take it when my stomach is upset it smells like cinnamon
im satisfied and arrived as described on time will buy again
it worked great
this is a very nice plate for my elderly father helps keep food from being pushed off the plate  i wish it was just a little bigger and a little less pricey but im glad i got it for him
these digestive advantage dark chocolate probiotic chews i thought tasted horrible i tried a couple of times to eat these and just couldnt do it sorry
one piece  is excellent foot feels better with it  other piece broke on top on firscwt wearing
fabulous on all counts it lathers very well that is why i got it washcloths dont do well with shower gel and poofs are hard on the skin but this mitt lathers with a little bit of gel and exfoliates like no ones business very relaxing and fits my hands well i had to cinch up the wrist strap to keep it on it also has a hole on the end for hanging
i transferred this product to a glass jar with a sealed top very easy to use stir in a spoon with my morning coffee tasteless with a slightly sweet accent combine with a good multib vitamin  a probiotic for best effectiveness
but here it is on the package with nonfruiting body extracts the mycelium is grown on a sterilized grain usually brown rice  if you see a product saying freezedried myceliated brown rice that means you are essentially receiving ground up brown rice with the roots of a mushroom extract mixed inmar 28 2016
i received this brush for my husband the other day and he tried it right out he said the brush bristles were very soft and was easy to use to apply the dry oil he said it turned easily in the oils and was easy to apply to his beard his beard felt softer and it wasnt so rough looking it keeps his beard soft and not old looking
i ordered and quickly received the pure science dgl licorice 500mg  contains 10 glycyrrhiza glabra root  supports digestive  respiratory function  50 vegetarian capsules the bottle arrived with a quality control seal and inner protective seal for best results take one 1 capsules daily preferably with meals or as directed by your healthcare professional do not exceed the recommended dose the bottle consist of fifty 50 capsules or fifty 50 servings per container  my daughter deals with the annoyance of hyperacidity and burning stomach and its not an occasional occurrence but a chronic thing  usually she dealt with burning stomach or heartburn is to take antacids like tums tagamet or prilosec all of these medications work by reducing the stomach acidity  tums contain alkaline ingredients like calcium carbonate that directly neutralizes the hcl acid in the stomach for a short period of time because obviously then the stomach produces more tagamet and zantac work by blocking the h2 histamine receptors which regulate the acid production on the stomach they provide a long lasting reduction in stomach acidity because they lower the production of acid instead of acting on the acid itself prilosec and similar drugs belong to the class of the proton pump inhibitors which again works by reducing the production of acid by the stomach in a long lasting and more aggressive way  one problem that people including often doctors dont understand is that when people experience heartburn or burning stomach its often not caused by an actual excess of acidity in the stomach but by a damage of the layer of mucus that protects the stomach lining the stomach is designed to have a very high acidity both to digest foods and to protect against pathogens that can be ingested with the food because most are killed by the highly acidic environment of the stomach acids damage tissues so normally there is a layer of acidresistant mucus that creates a buffer between the acid inside the stomach and the stomach itself as long as this barrier is in place everything is good  the mucus production however can be reduced by several different factors like use of aspirin and similar nsaids stress steroid drugs etc if the protective mucus is reduced the stomach lining will become vulnerable to the corrosive action of the stomach acids which will create burning pain etc  it seems clear that the best approach is to increase the production of protective mucus rather than reducing the stomach acidity yet all the official therapies focus on reducing the stomach acidity this by the way is a terrible idea unless its a legitimate case of hyperclorridia or excessive stomach acid because not only does it make you more vulnerable to food borne pathogens but it can contribute to an overgrowth of h pylori if thats already an issue for you helicobacter pylori is a bacteria commonly found in the stomach that can overcolonize lead to stomach ulcers h pylori prevents a less acidic environment and it can actually reduce the ph of the stomach acid so if you are taking anything to reduce stomach acid you are actually doing h pylori a favor for which it will repay you with some excruciating ulcers  additionally reducing stomach acid also impairs your digestion and assimilation of vitamins and nutrients vitamin b12 for instance requires a certain acidity for it to be absorbed same thing for iron and many others  the only thing that is known to increase the production of the protective stomach mucus is licorice which dgl is made from by the way i am talking about real licorice not the fake 34licorice34 flavored candies that are actually flavored with anise and bear no resemblance to real licorice  so far she have not had any side effects her stomach has not bothered me the licorice seems to be of good quality and there does not appear to be anything wrong with it i would recommend it to others  i received this free or virtually so for product testing and review i am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so my aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that i would want to know about as a buyer not hype the product for the manufacturer  i enjoy doing this and feel i am helping hundreds of people to make a decision on purchasing items on a monthly basis  my remarks are sincere and my own i work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item my hope is that these reviews are helpful to others while it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product again it is just my opinion your own opinion might vary i received no monetary compensation and not required to give a good review
i have short and thin lashes and this curler works beautifully
i dont know how but it works i was skeptical but there is no smoke smell i even took a drag from the cigarette outside of the car and blew it with the smoke buddy in the car just to test it out im not sure how long the filter will last but ill find out
having eczema and psoriasis on my fingers sometimes i have to protect them and using latex finger cots when i have a sensitivity to latex isnt easyalso i tend to go through a lot of them some fingers they are too tight others too loosethese seeming like the perfect idea  some kind of fabric reusable even washable and easy to storethe problem is the fabric  it is much too rough for my skin theyre itchy a bit tight at times and not easy to useim sure someone else would like this for me its a hard pass
right off the bat when tasting this i was rejoicing that it wasnt too sweet many products of this nature have stevia or monk fruit which not only have an aftertaste but they use so much that the sweetness is cloyingnot only is this product not super sweet but it has just a little sweetness that occurs naturally from the organic berry powdersand speaking of berries what a powerhouse in addition to beets and chaga mushrooms you have the superfruit goji maqui and acaisince berries are on the hot list of being highly contaminated with pesticides this is a product you can feel great about because all but the collagen peptides are organici love that i can just sprinkle it into my yogurt or oatmeal as well as mixing it with a liquid it tastes slightly sweet slightly earthy it gives a nice flavor to unsweetened yogurt especially if its sprinkled with nuts perfect healthy breakfastand only 25 calories for a tablespoonthe formulation is geared for beauty and by now we all know the benefit of collagen when it comes to skin but this is so much more than just skin loving i feel that its an allaround health tonicdefinitely will be getting more when this canister is doneupdate so i think i have found a breakfast nirvana english muffin with cherry preserves and  this powder sprinkled on top so darn good i go to sleep happy knowing im going to have this fantastic breakfast in the morningas another update since taking this regularly i feel that i have more energy and my mood is elevated now granted that could be a coincidence but i can tell you im going to keep taking it
great seller we had an issue no fault of the sellers but they still fixed it for us the vitamin e oil is great i use it on my face at night after i shower love it
my nails are very thick
i have been trying to up my intake of antioxidants and polyphenols  i cant attest to the fact that this helps but i am rotating it in and out of my daily supplementsi now always look for made in the usa  this has become very important to me whether it is supplements for me or the dogsi will continue taking these  i have not had any problems at all with these
excellent traction device  very helpful  good quality materials
this may get the water out of your ears but it really burns got this for the kids and tried it on myself first and it wasnt pleasant wont be using it again
my husband really likes this beard balm i had gotten him the starter sample set initially and he liked it enough to purchase the full size balm i like that the scent is mild and light a little pricey for what it is but it lasts a very long time so its worth it overall the guitar pick included for scooping out the product is a nice touch
definitely worth it you get more than youll use in a life time unlike every other brand ive tried the dont dent after just a couple weeks it takes about 2 months before you need to change them because theyre made of such a strong and resistant material their also not too small so you can be sure you lashes wont get caught between these replacement pads and the metal of your actual curler
i must not have read the size before purchase theyre huge but well made and very pretty
we keep these around for the trades working through the punch list through out our house  they like them because they easily fit over their boots
my son loved these
the advantage is the clip that allows me to hook the case on my safety vestsafety is essential
did nothing for me
i dont have an issue with straps around my ears  however i was hoping that these extenders would make it easier for me to take my mask on and off allowing it to hang from my neck when needed  unfortunately these were not really good for that purpose  i found it hard to adjust the mask straps over the small nibs of the extender  once i did get the straps in place there is nothing to keep them there  i found that the extender kept shifting and the straps of the mask fell off  i cant use these how i wanted to and and i wouldnt recommend them
do your lures stink they probably do and you dont realize it wash them in this soap and your catch rate will increase
the champaign glasses kept deflating
love that this filament has a cover and little bumps on the foot to show you were to use the filament great value
i got the number 2it didnt come with a tube to inflate it as some of the other balloons that are this style dodeflated it measures around 43 inches talli used a common straw to inflatemy mouth it took me about 2 minutes to inflate i was worried i popped it but it was just settling in and was full shortly afterinflated my 2 measured only about 33 tall for this reason i deducted one star as the listing was for a 40 balloonthe pink color is really prettythere are two loops on the top and bottom to hang this balloonto manually deflate the balloon simply slide in a straw and move the air into the direction of the straw the air will move out of the balloon through the straw it took me around 5 minutes to deflate the balloonthe air coming out of the balloon smells like nail polish
this item wasnt what i thought and seemed a bit on the cheap side  it works though
i like the glasses when spotting stains calmer on my eyes
australian bush flower essences are standard products of known quality so there is little i can add about the remedies themselveshowever the amazon distribution company is awesome even though its standard shipping the bush flowers arrive very fastits easier to get them here than in australiaall the products from this distributor are the original standard australian bush flower essences its stock essence which is more economical since the user must dilute it himself and lasts for many bottles in order to dilute you need to buy a little dropper bottle for a few cents in a drug store and mix a few drops of the product with water and possibly brandy to keep the water fresh
i am not sure that it keeps the bugs away as much i want it to my almost 5 year old  son is very prone to get bitten by mosquitoes and being a boy he also likes to play closer to fence in the yard as a result he gets real close to where most of mosquitoes are i dont think this lotion is effective on such kids also it does not exactly work like a guard as in shield none of the ones i have used so far work that way if i miss a spot my son gets bites therei would recommend it for summer outdoor use not for activities like trails in a state park or evening soccer practiceother thing i would comment is it does not have strong smell like some of the others do
i got this to help with a edible tincture and it works very well  i must say that a small portion goes a long way
doesnt mix a well as other products ive tried there is a blob of unmixed powder thats suborn and wont dissolve this watermelon flavor is strong and tastes much better than the mojito flavor performance wise it gives me the boost i need for my workouts i cant say its any better or worse as far as the energy boost goes compared to competing products
the inside coating of our cover started falling off after after only a few weeks  all of the plastic clips to attatch it to ramp are broken and it leaks  seller told no refund after 30 days  i bought another waterproof cover from a different seller for 15 that has heldup better than this one
my daughter has potz syndrome so we have to track her water intake we have a water bottle that has a sensor for daily use however there are times that the water bottle just isnt as handy this is a great alternative to fill in those time its small and the band has great elasticity fits over all glasses we have used it on thus far the light is just right it flashes to signal the user hasnt taken a drink however it isnt so bright that the whole restaurant will look at you i would recommend this it has help us a lot
works better than the 60 scale it replaced  its very accurate
i try to do what i can for the environment so i love this brand i brought them with me to serve my specialty cocktails in for 4th of july and was feeling a lot better than if they were a solo cup
i purchased these to give a few drops of medication to my dogs orally i was terrified to use a syringe but these are individually wrapped and very easy to use since im using to get into the medicine bottle and only get a few drops out they work well for what i need the needles appear thick the syringe is well made strong and clearly marked i cannot speak to accuracy of ml but the plunger worked perfectly  i searched around for a long time and ultimately decided this was the most economical purchase for my use
this brush cut 50 of time straightening my hair  it has the ability to adjust the temperature and steam i received this iron very fast which is always nice
love the cube design perfect for those who want to use in a small space an air purifier with a white noise output device itself creates a white noise that actually can be soothing and will not interrupt sleep or conversationi appreciate this comes ready to use and includes an extra filter one concern i do have is there is no listing for replacement filters to purchase at this time the concern is if its necessary to replace this item prior to being available online and second issue what will these cost this matters for me to make a claim this is value worthy to a buyer as you can see these questions can affect whether this purchase holds true value ifwhenhow much replacement filters will be and its my reason for detecting x1 staras for functionality this seems very easy and straightforward this contains solid and helpful instructions that include diagrams as well as real time photos see pics i included it also includes a small screwdriver which is needed to open cover at given time very helpful to be all inclusive hack keep instruction manual extra filter included and tool all in one place this will simplify the filter swap when neededbuttons are white with gray writing and have indicator light when selected but for any with less than stellar eyesight you may need to navigate choices under regular light source at least till youve become familiar with button placement otherwise it can be hard to see not a deal breaker just a factor to consider who will be end user and could this pose an issue  once you selected a  function this works as expected and does a fantastic job it allows varied speeds and set timing options it even notifies when filter must be replaced lets just hope its available hoping this info helps your decision stay safe
this is all over the web as a miracle cleaner  i think a homemade paste using baking soda vinegar and dawn
the baggies they come in are pretty cool if only the electrodes contained within were not of the worst quality i have experiencedz i have 15 years of needing transdermal e nerve stim in order to bear the pain if walking with my spine all jacked these are  the worst they are gooey sticky yet barely adhere to the skin had to use electrical tape to get em to stay wout shocking me now if unlike me you remain stationary  for the stim as well as dont need them on constant it may still be a good buy but maybe no cuz reusing these pads isnt really an option  they leave gooey goo boogars on ya party foul  for shame electrodes for shame
great replacement for current unit easy to install
my husband  i have both broke our placards and these covers have enabled us to still hang the cardwell worth the money
i bought one for my hearing less ear and was so impressed because in a crowded store the sound stayed true so impressed that i took them up on their offer of savings if i bought a 2nd one it just arrived and i tried them both wellas it turns out my bad ear wasnt the bad one at all it was my right one so with volume set on 1 for the left ear and 2 for the right ear i had great hearingi had bought a less expensive one from someone else and the moment i had walked into the grocery store i had to remove it the buzz noise was overwhelmingbut these are the greatest for me one was really good two were the greatest for me
how wonderful to get 12 large jars of moisturizing petroleum jelly  this stuff works great to keep my very dry skin in check  with this volume i can slather it on after a bath and let it do its magic  it is petroleum jelly though  greasy stuff  so you have to be careful until it soaks in because it will leave grease stains on clothingthis works great  i did find the slightly sweet slightly perfumey slightly medicinal scent to be a little cloying as the day progressed  i used a lot of this all over my body  i suspect if you didnt use so much the scent would be barely detectable  anyway it works great the price is right and the scent is very subtle but not particularly pleasant after a while
you get what you pay for these are cheap watch pins the stem that fits into the watch case is too short to effectively hold the band on for very long the first pin i installed on my watch fell out in one day the double shoulder helps with the installation process i did receive the installation tool with the kit two stars because they work if only for a short time i am now sopping for a set of pins that have longer stems that will provide a more secure fit
it comes on it is quiet and it is tiny it has a nice look if not a little scifi do these things really work no idea but we hope they do
these are terrible quality and broke within a couple of days  do not waster your 
i used it once very happy with scent and the way it cleaned my mat  but as i tried to use it second time the spray mechanism on bottle does not push down completely and the spray just drips out  i tried fixing it to no avail  otherwise would give it five stars
after purchasing gel gloves that did not fit i decided to try these cotton gloves which are a great value  of course you use your own hand lotion and cuticle cream but they are comfortable to wear all night  and you can wear the same pair many times given that you are putting them on clean hands  so a dozen pair will last a long timei havent done it but i presume that you could also use them for dirty work to keep your hands clean
had this set up for amazon subscription but was out of stock on the 1st and the 2nd scheduled subscription delivery so i dropped itas far as the quality of the product its excellent i now just try to order it when it looks like ill need it
what is needed
these are fantastic i wish i had found these years ago my only downside is they are full of powder and my skin is pretty sensitive to it
while these arent the softest tissues the round packaging is amazing they fit in car cupholders perfectly the tissues come out of the canisters smoothly very useful
this is a set of 10 protein powder packets the packets can be mixed with water or in a smoothie the packets are very convenient you can put them in your gym bag for after your workout or you could take them to the office for a healthy snack at the end of the day the packets contain 200 calories and 10 grams of protein they feature an appealing texture and excellent flavor these travel packets are an excellent way to ensure you always have a healthy option to help fend off cravings
i usually slip these heel protectors on my bare feet before putting socks on and because theyre a bit thinner than other ones ive tried i can wear them with tighter shoes that i wasnt able to wear heel sleeves with before they add a little cushion every time you take a step which reduces strain on your heels and helps relieve pain from plantar fasciitis massaging your feet is important when treating plantar fasciitis and this set comes with a small ball you can roll under your feet for a massaging effect
what i like about this product organic nongmo you could break the tablets in half easy to digest no flavor burpscons tablets are large if you dont break them in half not ideal for those who have a hard time swallowing pills unsure if these contain curcumin the bottle says curcuma i dont know if they are the same thing or different but i specifically take turmeric curcumin with black pepper
im not sure why this company is only focusing on pumpkin seed oil for mens issuesthats only one small part of this powerhouse oilfor arthritis as a preventive measure if macular degeneration runs in your family and for healthy glowing skin pumpkin seed oil has a high level of beneficial fatty acidsit can affect blood pressure so talk with your doctor if you have high or low bp
love it really works
love how it long but not bulky when folded
well i wanted to get some sort of benefit from these but theyre useless i dont believe in the 34copper34 voodoo but thought there would be some stability offered  there isnt i thought maybe some benefit from the compression  there isnt these do not stay up any movementwalking causes these to simply work their way down ur legs this was not a worthwhile purchase at all
not thrilled with this product i wanted it to work but it did not stretch my shoes at all
sometimes you get a pair of shoes that just is not comfortable  the base of the shoe where the ball of the foot is can be too thin and it can be hard on the feet  these pads do seem to help but lets take a closer lookwhat are these pads likethese pads are for the ball of the foot  they have a place for the area under the toes so you know where to put them  the backing is a type which will hold into place pretty well  it can be washed and reused  the cushion has some flock on it which keeps it soft instead of overly rubberyhow do these performso far i have a pair on one of my shoes  the pad did make the shoe slightly tighter but that pair had the room  if the shoes are really fitted they could make it too tight  the pad did not seem to slide around that much and so far they have been good if i am not careful however they will slidefuture updatesi will continue to test them in other shoes however and update my review if i have anything to addthe bottom linefor reusable pads for the ball of the foot in some shoes that just are too hard these are nice  they will make the shoes tighter so you need to have room for themmy ratingso far four stars they stay pretty well in place but can shift a bit if you are not careful
my perfume did not transfer into the bottle instead all over me ive used products similar to this before and this just did not work at all
this worked well
fort of all the containers are very sturdy and the piil have a smallpocket to fill it just not sitting on the bottom of container
my husband will not drive my car without this cushion  finally something that he had sit on for drives over 20 minutes
i used it to infuse olive oil  it made a wonderful salve
cleans ball well
bought the clay version it doesnt get that hot and it doesnt stay hot for more then like 510 min honestly just fill up a giant sock with rice and tie the end it works better
i started drinking my coffee with this mix in it to give me the bullet coffee effect this will give you more energy and curb your appetite you will need a blender to get this blended well a spoon will not cut it
well satisfied
i cant wait till wear these after halloween hoping itll bring some cheer
my guest absolutely loved them for opening bottles and pushing buttons without touching them personally
these are decent if you have pain in the ball of your feetfoot i even put these on my custom made orthodics and they do relieve the pain i do notice they move around although they have reusable on the package i am not sure how well they will stick but will keep this updated as pain in my feet keep me from doing a lot of thingsupdate not real happy with these after some time only because they will roll up when you put your shoe on maybe from the glue rubbing off not sure bt it becomes a hassle even though it does help
i like the scarf it just doesnt stay in place the way i thought it would
we go through a lot of chickpeatos they are good for snacks to take to school road trips etc make sure to bring water as you will feel thirsty after eating a bunch of these
so not tobaccoim sure its written in the review that its not tobacco but damnits a horrible alternative the hookah rocks are much better then thisgo get some starbuzz and call it a day
we like it for the price we paid bought at open box pricing cant find the directions for the remote
awful one was completely broken and the other was scratched up on the handle
great additive to water
this was a total waste of money it was so uncomfortable and showed under all my clothes i got a wider width support bandfor a third of the price from babies r us and it was much more comfortable and supportive
not sure if it works yet but one of the two bottles doesnt even spray
love the smell and feels great
thin wool matted down quickly
comes wellpackaged and is very suitable for giftingscent is rather bland at first hit  once you give it a while to work warm up and settle in on the skin it does open up a bit  complex  but a still a bit muddythis is not an amazing scent  not really memorable  but nice and subtle enough for everyday use or gym roll onill continue to use it and update this review
doesnt snap shut tight enough
any lions fan will love these ziplocs a little pricey but living in florida we cant get any of our team gear here so of course im willing to spend a bit
the case my jewelry from getting dusty
the scrubber is very soft and dispersed my body bath soap luxuriously  there are four in a packet and i have only used one three times therefore it is difficult to say how long it will last
i have been using this for over 6 months and i got to tell you its amazing  i bought it to use to brush my teeth with  i have gum problems they hurt and they itched all the time  when i went to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned she had to use numbing stuff just to clean my teeth they were so sensitive and so painful  when i returned six months later for my next cleaning she was totally amazed that my gums looked so healthy and they were not inflamed anymore and she cleaned them in half the time  there was very little tarter build up as well  it is so very soothing to my gums  i dont use toothpaste anymore or mouthwash even natural stuff because this dragons blood does it all  i read that it can be put on the gum line to help keep the gums from receding  i know it works to seal wounds and i have used it on my gums to seal them to keep particles from getting into them  i am ordering much more now
my hair seems to be improving or at least that is what my hairdresser says
got a mentally challenged brother who uses the bathroom on himself i could not stand to walk into his living area without vomiting we spray this on his bed his chair his laundry it works
tldr comfortable but ineffectiveim a side sleeper and live closer to a major highway which i can hear through the walls and windows of the house at all times  i was hoping this would help me block out those sounds to get to have a better quality of sleepthese are easy earplugs to insert and for my ear shape  size do not stick out enough to be a problem with side sleeping  they are also comfortable  these are the two reasons i gave this product 2 starsafter a couple of seconds of them in my ears my hearing adjusted to normal levels  i feel like i could hear everything i could normally
these liners are a good value they are thicker than i was looking for but they worked out
good color rendition quite bright for its size  runs a little more hot than i expected
i got it for my mother in law and my self we loved it because its long and our sleeves dont get wet and its comfortable
this clears my stuffy nose love it
first they come in a ziploc storage bag a very thoughtful feature they are perfect sleeping gloves soft lightweight not tight and cotton and washable definitely five stars
fit perfect would reccommend
for years we have used redmond bentonite clay to make our homemade toothpaste but when i came across this tooth powder i thought id give it a try i love it it makes my mouth feel super clean and healthy
product as described and fast shipping works great
this product works almost immediately to stop foot and leg cramps sometimes they wake me out of deep sleep and its all i can do to hobble to the bathroom because of the pain and cramping i rub this stuff on where its having a spasm and within 2 minutes its gone works every time
ive tried a few different kinds of bee pollen and this is the most extremely delicious compared to the bee pollens its nowhere near as sweet as honey and it does taste very earthy but this is delicious if you like any healthy foods then youll love thisif youve never tried bee pollen before or if its been a while then youre supposed to start out with just a few grains at a time and then build yourself up to eating it by the spoonful but luckily ive build up a tolerance to it over the years so i can eat a lot of it its great to just eat by the handful except the granules are small and a few of them fall to the floor its great in protein shakes even though they dont fully dissolve then they naturally sweeten your drink theyre also great on ice cream too basically these mix well with everything and theyre also great by themselvesys eco is an illinois company so the closer that you live to illinois then the better that you get the 34local honey34 effect of helping with your allergies but i live all the way over in utah and this pollen still helps me out a lot with my allergiesi read some horror stories about other bee pollens and so ive been meticulously checking this for bee parts im pleased to report that this is only bee pollen and doesnt have any bee parts in it i highly recommend this
i cant tell you how much i love this bangle i did not get my name on it  i loved the word hope on it so i ordered it that way  because we all need hope in the world with everything that is going on  thank you so much  i wear it everday and it holds up great
i have a brain injury which has effected my short term memory  i thought this might help and so far it has  i feel like it is easier to concentrate and my memory has improved  i havent noticed any side effects
its such a simple design but the material is so soft and provides great sound dampening i highly recommend it for road trips and just day time naps great product
this is an effective tool my advice is to go ahead and buy the course or extra course rollers the normal roller wasnt effective and i didnt or dont  have problem feet i am satisfied with this purchase
amazing product after years or battling with one toenail this was recommend by a doctor used several times daily and all clear
this works well except the instructions are very vague no instructions about how much antifreeze to add and leaks around the bottom of the control panel but works as needed
works good
i was pleased that this actually was compromised of firm plastic all over i really like that the port where the oxygen is attached does not swivel
cant use caused burning sensation like nettles
love  i used it to create 34zombie flesh34 on a pumpkin for a pumpkin decorating context i had never worked with liquid latex before so followed some very very good youtube video tutorials this product was so easy to use and so effective with the look that i wanted to create ripped 34walking dead34 fleshi could not be happier especially as a novice
so cute in cute mugs with gifts of hot cocoa bombs at christmas loved the little added touch having super cute straws
recommended by my dentist works great prevents my gums from bleeding
this does not work for me it did nothingi gave it a 3 star for getting it fast
my son was so happy when we received these you would have thought he won the lottery when he opened up the box they were used as toys in and out of the bathtub and he loved 34washing34 the dirt off the planes with water out of all his new planes toys since then he still loves these the best they were a great deal
drop one tablet in the he washer and it it provides plenty of bleach  no mess  no fuss  it is also effective as a cleaning and disinfectant elsewhere int he house  with liquid bleach being so difficult to find i highly rate these tablets
excellent product did exactly as advertised was a little difficult to set up but once i understood the instructions it took no time to install i use it everyday and i find it very useful 
love these scrubbers colorful and work well not scented
sometimes you never think about needing a really good kleenex but when its needed or for people that we love need them more often than not its nice to know that we have puffs with lotion because when your nose gets really sore from blowing its nice to know it gets treated a lot better with these
ive just scrolled through many many reviews in search of encouragement   and now ready to offer some   i didnt find anyone like me    i emailed the company this morning asking for encouragement  but realize they are limited with so many ready to cause trouble and suchi am 60 years old  65 year old husband  adopted 5 aned 8 year old grandsons  terrible healthy  organic  exercise  fresh juices   healthy fasting      for 25 years       terrible stress with daughter addict ending in her death and adoption of these boys   for 10 yearsmighty big seek for full potential with energy  sleep  digestion  brain clarity  happiness   over all health   we need it  received restore and started with 12 t a day   oooooo did we poke the bear joint pain haulted us in our tracks  migraine like never before     i will not stopreduced and reduced dose  down to 3 drops a day for me  4 drops for papa  1 drop for each boy   whew manageable headaches  stiff neck  rabid stinkin thinkin   sleepy sleepy sleepy   and i gotta say increased cravings for candy ice cream and cookies  for me   strange as i have had a clean diet   gained at least 5 pounds  weve been taking restore for 6 weeks   i will not stopsofter feet  no allergies  tremendous sleep improvement  tiny  and i mean teeny weenie peeks at hope and happiness  euphoric kind of child like mind set  as it should be i believe   all is wellsomething in that bottle is just giving me hope and making me believe  papa too   god help us   will update when there is news
this is a super heavy duty set of nail clippers  the tip is long and curved and works great for getting those ingrown nails  the clippers are super sharp and cut nearly effortlessly there are double springs for use with either hand  the handles are very padded and very comfortable to use  these will cut even the thickest grossest nails imaginable  even the cover is well thought out and protects the tips from damage
i find this lions mane powder in capsules to be very good quality it has no taste that i can detect i dont like swallowing pills so i open the capsules and dump the lions mane powder into another container and then add it to my coffee in loose form the recommended dosage is 2 capsulesday and thats about the scooped amount i put in my coffee lions mane has many healthy benefits and my husband and i have been taking a blend of various mushroom powders including lions mane everyday for the past couple of years and both of us have not been the least bit sick since starting that i think this is an excellent supplement
it looks like chicken or turkey gravy but when you put it in it is cold for a while which can be nice
great item at a great price thank you
easy to use easy to move and fits my shower head perfectly  i can put this holder anywhere in my shower tub combo and it will stay put  i highly recommend it if you are taking care of rinsing off your kids in the tub or cleaning your tub or washing pets in the tub to lower the handle  also if you need a handle higher up in the shower like for my giantly tall brother when he visits not he can put the shower head at his height  i highly recommend this product  all pros no cons for this product so far
worked very well  after gum surgery light weight easily placed where needed without adding more discomfort  they r pink
great brush  i love dry brushing it is great for circulation and for cellulite  this brush has a long detachable handle  the handle is great for reaching your back or getting all the way down your legs with out bending over of picking up your legs  it just makes the process easier  the quality of the brush as a whole is great and i highly recommend this product if you are looking for a dry brushsample provided for testing and review
this was an awesome find lots of herbs more than expected and packaged with great quality i really enjoyed this its definitely giftable but id rather keep it
got to my house faster than expected and is exactly what i wanted i would reccommend it to anyone thank you
what we liked most was that it does an excellent job of cleaning your eyeglasses better than anything we have used but it is a two part system first you use the wet one then the dry one  the wipes are very small and unless you have very small glasses you cannot do both sides at the same time so you have to decide if super clean glasses is your goal or a convenient one part glasses wipes are more important to you
would to have a lower strength 175200
a bit expensive but well made and heavysubstantial with a nice cover having trouble with my hip and thisseems to help a lot both in my truck and at home in an office chair i am happy enough that im going to orderthe larger my expensive cushion next
it is awesome they came with cases for storagei have very sensitive ears that hurt with the expanding kind i have worn the swimmer wax ones but hated how they caught in my hair or dislodged over night i work night shift so sleep in the day and cannot sleep through anything now i canthese are perfectly flexible and nice soft feel definitely reccomend
im happy w the product the price and the delivery speed
i think it would be better as a clear product  the bubbles it makes are a good indication that youre using the rez block
i bought this thru their site but i know everyone goes to amazon for reviews i took it for a month with no difference whatsoever if anything it just made my hair feel greasyin addition to that the company that makes it is the rudest ive ever experienced  the company not this seller just to be clear
product in perfect condition
my daughter got this piggy when she was born and still has it but she wanted another given its been over 20 years  the pig is the exact one she had since birth
i like this all in 1 shaver i know it says for bald men but it works great on my legs especially my knees because of the way the heads move all around and get close to the skin it is also a trimmer a hair clipper a face massager a nose and ear hair trimmer it has a nice led screen it is recgargeable it is well made and works great
reviews are correct the floss function is messy works well though
hemp goodness
great replacement
yummmmyyy scents i could smell the delicious smelling scents even before i opened the box these bombs dissolve beautifully and  leave the room smelling great warning i used one that had glitter and it was a bit messy   i store them in a drawer until i go to use one so they can double as a sachet
did not taste as good as the raw red maca from the organique company i might try the raw one from this brand and see how it goes i use it to make tea  love me some maca tea
i really like this large lunch bag it is insulated it has a smooth double zipper and has a small outer pocket the top is hinged and opens wide the handles are thin but feel solid it comfortably holds a 6 pack of drinks or a large lunch with ice pack the grey color is neutral and pleasant highly recommend
love this stuff
i have utilized this in physical therapy and was extremely excited to find it on amazon i will continue to use it on a daily basis to help strengthen my wrist and forearm it has been a great addition to my  work out routine but anyone considering purchasing this should check with their physical therapist or doctor first
im giving this 5 stars even though its mainly petroleum jelly  i had always used the traditional white diaper rash creams on my kids when they were babies and it wasnt until i used it on myself after getting chafed from a long hike did i realize that those diaper rash creams stung i hope my babies werent stung by the name brand diaper creams that were used on them but i wish i had the petite planet multipurpose to use on them instead  its clear and has a nice scent and though i dont know for sure i doubt it will sting much if any when applied to irritated skin  i have used it on my hands elbows and face and it feels fine but greasy like petroleum jelly
i love these but tge are delicious the price is too high here i can buy them at cvs for 14 the price
didnt cancel much noise and were uncomfortable when side sleeping the stems seem too long
i really like that this brand takes a broader approach to skincare by including supplements as well as topical products this biotin supplement blend has a lot of other vitamins that are also really great for hair skin and nails personally i take a lot of supplements and i can find juggling supplement blends to be a bit of a hassle but i wanted to give this brand a try all the way around and i do think that this is a great blend for people who dont take a lot of supplements overall i like it
i have oily skin and its so hard to wear makeup because it smudges and looks greasy after an hour or two ive noticed a drastic difference with this it keeps my oily skin matted for hours you also dont have to use much at all and the bottle is bigger than i expected so it should last a long time
will be returning does not fit my toothbrush even though my model was listed and now i cannot remove the head not happy
coq10 is an antioxident thats produced by your body but that decrease as we age taking suppliments is supposed to help maintain heart health as well as blood pressure among other things this formula touts itself as being water dissolvable and therefore has 3 times the absorption so the 100 mg gel caps should be more effective than comparable brands so far it appears to be exactly as described though sometimes its difficult to tell with suppliments such as these theyre considered safe and have health benefits beyond even the heart health which is enough
it was strongly recommended to buy this when have total knee replacement but i found that i could just as easily slide on my pants and socks and that that stretching helped improve muscle tone  for those with a back back or who simply cannot reach their shoes and socks it can be a helpful tool
the card holder section comes apart easily the liners dont stay in to hold the cards in place the magnet is not strong enough to hold the cover closed i gave it away and ordered one from another company
i like this therapy roll on  the smell is great and despite not having any lemon oil it smells like lemon to me grapefruit and lime bergamot are the citrus scents in this plus a fir and peppermint  i tried it out when i had a slight migraine and it didnt help but it also didnt make it worse  i dont think it was designed for headaches so im going to give it a go on a non headache day and see if it helps with mood and alertness  i like the smell a lot and expect it will help somewhat with mood improvement
there is no way to thread the electric of a mask even following the directions on the site
good price effective refillable  i use these for soft scrubbing cleaning  keep one in the kitchen and each bathroom  i purchase the bulk bag of baking soda to refill the shakers  a great companion purchase  add a little vinegar to the sink or whatever you are cleaning with baking soda for a disinfecting property  all natural  i never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  and i hope this info was helpful to you
highly recommend works great quick and easy to use makes feet very soft would definitely buy again
the limeade is a great flavor it mixes well and tastes good with other flavors it does have a weird smell that i cant place i dont know if its the coconut water sucralose bcaas or something else its not unbearable or even bad i just dont know what it is i would also like to know more about the quality of the bcaas and how they are derived this is also sweetened with sucralose which isnt my favorite otherwise i would give this five stars
i wear compression socks everyday because i sit for 9 hours  at the end of the day ive noticed that my feet and ankles are not swollen  i get a lot of compliments on the design too
has a pleasant smell without being overwhelming took care of the odor in the shoes
perfect for its purpose and price
i disliked because the bristles were so short it couldnt clean the teeth
not good since they changed the formula years ago not the same effect
it isnt super effective  it freshened up the garments a little bit but definitely not a substitute for dry cleaning  i might use it in between dry cleaning to freshen up a dress but thats about it
its like washing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo  i havent noticed any huge difference but im a senior and really cant expect miracles  the fragrance is very light  i have a lot of sinus problems but this doesnt bother me at all
before you consume this you might want to know that the dosage recommended by  dr oz on his may 21 show 34craving killers to shut down your appetite34 is 50 mg twice a day which is a total of 100 mg the product is described on this site as 800 mg per capsule 1600 mg per serving which would be 16 times more than what dr oz recommends im just relaying what dr oz said if you want to know more ask him
helped when my husband hurt his hand
this not only provides a nice scent but its also a great way to disinfect  remove wrinklesplease lysol never stop making this its an amazing product
it works just not like the videos in my opinion
purchased for my wife it is kind of a pain to fill and lug around but once she uses it her feet feel 100 better heat and massage are perfect and work exactly as advertised draining the unit is pretty simple with the attached drain hose
cheap doesnt get as hot as a regular flatiron the comb is worthless i have a short pixie and had high hopes for this i normally dont return amazon stuff but this thing was a joke and it just pissed me off before work i cant imagine this would straighten a course beard
i like this water flosser because is small and perfect for travel so i have one for home and this one when we are out of townit has different settings that you can adjust the powerthe water reservoir in smaller than others that i have but thats the same reason why its more comfortable for travel it does not need too much space on the bag
it was exactly what i ordered large enough to put all of my essential oil and morelightweight and easy to store
most sunshine lamps will burn out  there is an exception the model sold by amazoncom known as lights of america desk lampthe lights of america sunshine desk lamp last almost forever  it is well madethe good thing about verilux lamps is they are guaranteed for 3 years under warrantythe other brands inexpensive or high cost will eventually burn out  maybe in 3 months  maybe within 2 yearsaccording to other reviews and the company itself verilux will replace their productsso although you may be paying more it is well worth it  avoid the cheap lamps on ebay or amazoncomif you need a floor lamp get the verilux
perfect product easy to use has great hold and has held up to my needs
very nice bath brushes
misleading advertizment
it took off discoloration plus removed material that wasnt removed by pixie cup wash or other wipes plus boiling i did deduct a star because alcohol to wipe a cup that goes in a sensitive area is not the best
i bought this to store my colored sequins as i am a crafter  the compartments close well and stay closed till you open them  perfect for my use  and they would be perfect for medications as the compartments are roomy
this is a hard review as i cant see any signs that this is or sint doing what it is touted to do the flavor is not great does not taste good or enhance anything i think this would have to be used long term to be able to give a fair assessment of how well it worked as claimed
not really sure that this is doing anything that a wash rag doesnt it seems to be making my skin flaky maybe that is how it works getting rid of old bad skin cells i am hoping that it will get better and there is a new younger me is under all that flaky skin  so far i havent made up my mind but i keep getting emails from the company to review their product so here it is
i have used gold bond products for years  every one of them has been a winner and this is no exception  i get those itchy summer dry skin patches that are so annoying  i hate using lotion when it is hot it just makes me fell sweaty and gross  i have this a try and let magic all those itchy spots went away within 2 days  the spray is refreshing and cooling and leaves no gross sticky residue  i use it daily and have not had any issues it also helps prevent sweaty chaffing when im out working hard in the hot sun  another winning product from gold bond

there are 6 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set in the scents listed below romance  la vie en rose optimism  orange juice happiness  lemon tree confidence  grapefruit punch acuity  chocolate mint tranquility  purple lavendereach fragrance is divine smells fresh and all the scents are different but they are only subtly different these bombs are made with essential oils and they are large since i personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath i use them in a foot bath one bath bomb dissolves in about five minutes in close to hot water the fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening i also love that the color did not adhere to my skin or to my foot bath at least the color of the romance bomb i tried did not adherethe current price of 1799 comes to 3 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again i feel these are better than most this would make a wonderful gift

there are six medium thick and elegant birthday gift bags in this set also there were supposed to be 12 handle ribbons that have to be assembled with the bag but only 10 ribbons were supplied this means one bag cannot be used because there are no handles for it to assemble it is important to hook the plastic tongue above the hole or the handles will fall outthese bags are attractive and highend they are perfect for birthdays each bag fits two one liter bottles of olive oil with room to spare or it fits one bottle with lots more room to spare see photo   however at the current price of 1079 1199 minus 10 for 6 bags it comes to a pricey 180 per bag since i only received 5 usable bags in my set it comes to 216 per bag
i absolutely love these straws i bought them to match some red  black party decorations  they matched real well a hit at the birthday gathering i had

i needed something to keep my medication and vitamins in this is the perfect size and i can see through it to help me find what i am looking for i do wish it had a strap on it instead of just a handle on the side but it still works so well  it is also much sturdier than it looks as the plastic is thicker than most plastic bags

i like that these bcaas are vegan flavored and contain glutamine the apple is pretty good it dissolves good enough to not leave chunks or blobs of powder but it doesnt turn sheer in total these are pretty good not perfect but ive had much worse i do think drinking this helps with my workouts and muscle building and healing
this is a typical hardcover journal it is nicely bound and has a ribbon bookmark so that one can locate the page of where they left off it is also ruled the only thing i do not like is that the date is on the right side of the odd pages there is a date and page header on each page on the left side of the book these are located on the left however on the right side they are located on the right  i would expect the date to always be on the left no matter whether it is an odd or even page it also would have been nice if they numbered the pages automatically since one is unlikely to remove pages from this nicely bound bookother than this this is a nice journal that is built to last
its simple but still holds everything my bible and my notes has many pockets too good for pens papers and more

i have a mild form of ibs and have been taking probiotics in pill form for years now i thought i would try something different by using a chewable variety and i was thrilled when i saw this i was a little skeptical with the title of dark chocolate and it brought back memories as a kid of chocolate exlax flavoring boy was i pleasantly surprised the flavor of this chewable probiotic is absolutely amazing it actually makes me look forward to taking my daily probiotic to help keep my ibs in check since taking this i do feel better and my bloating issues have definitely decrease as we all know probiotics are good bacteria and everyone even without ibs issues should be taking probiotics daily just to help your digestive system perform optimally if you are looking for a type of probiotic that you can actually like taking and you love chocolate this digestive advantage dark chocolate will definitey fill the bill
ive just started using these shrink wrap bags for my bath bombs they are fantastic the size is perfect i can get 2 bath bombs wrapped per bag the price is one of the best ive found and the best part is that im not getting holes every time i try to wrap something with my previous bags i would go through 34 on each bath bomb because theyd tear apart these are very sturdy and well made youre not supposed to be able to smell through these but after a few days i can slightly smell my product through the wrap which is greatthank you as long as the price stays the same i will continue to purchase these shrink wrap bags here
does what its supposed to and how its supposed to
i found these very challenging to read  i really have no others to compare them to but im thinking these are hard to read based on my experience and some of the other reviews  i will be trying another brand

i saw a commercial for this silicone back scrubber for shower i loved the way it lathered up on the commercial it did not do this for me i tried both sides i tried more body wash i tried rubbing the back scrubber against itself to create the lather nothing workedi loved the feel of the little scrubbers and it may very well be a good exfoliator but that is about all it would be good for the description for this scrubber said improves vascular blood circulation helps evenly distribute fat deposits and release metabolic waste of your skin at the same time i cant see that this will be effectivei will not be recommending this silicone back scrubber for shower to friends and family i will be letting them know that the commercial shows a lot of lather but it did not produce that for me
this airway tube is a great addition to a first aid or trauma kit but one needs to be trained how to use it in addition the tube has an close expiration date it comes in a sterile bag and made of medical grade plastic

unless you are just loaded with money and dont mind spending 7998 for a months supply of this supplement id find these components elsewhere for a lot cheaper  turmeric capsules are cheap and easy to find astaxanthin and holly basil leaf supplements are cheap and easy to find and probably artic pine too no way would i buy this especially for the turmeric content  i have bags of turmeric powder can be found at a regular grocery store and about a billion capsules of turmeric supplement and i know its cheap to buy  i also have a lot of holly basil and astaxanthin to take anytime i need it  im sure the contents and bioavailability of these move capsules are very good and theyre easy to swallow but my cheapness just wont let me part with that much money for something i can get for less than half and more of it
this product is meant for spraying surfaces that have already been cleaned so its not very useful as a cleaner
great product
i would rate 5 except who can really verify absorbency  the pepper extract is necessary for the curc to be absorbed usefully in the body  curc its self has so many benefits that the list goes on  on  we take it for the help with inflamation joint support and general body well being  actually have been taking for over a year and believe whole heartedly in it  please do some research and find the benefits that can really help you
i was worried about that sharp apple cider taste but to my surprise these were really good i take it in two bites and you do get a whiff of the cider but thats it just a whiff it also has pom and beet juice which is so good for your health my hubby and i both started on these and within a couple of days we both just felt a difference better lighter hard to explain but good so came back and ordered 2 more bottles this is one of those items really im really glad to take a chance on and be happy with the results
doesnt really do anything and it broke soon after purchase
updatedat first i really liked these sleep masks i had to make a small adjustment but they seemed to work well so i gave them four stars well now that i have used it for a while the red sleep mask leaves black marks from the strap all over my sheets the black dye will not wash all the way out so i have ruined a nice set of sheets i dont know if this is the case with all the masks from this company or just mine so beware when you purchasethese sleep masks are pretty good especially for the price you get two masks two sets of foam ear plugs which i dont use and a carrying case i really like that these are contoured over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyelid the only reason they didnt get five stars is the nosepiece i found it to be a little too wide i had to perform minor surgery and cut out a small vshaped piece of material from the nosepiece in order to make the mask block out more light from the bottom and take pressure off the bridge of my nose now they work great but i probably decreased the lifespan of the masks but for the price i dont think that will be problem time will tell
the sugar in this mix is enzymatically modified stevia that does not occur in nature so in my opinion is not naturally sweetened as stated on the package that is why i took off two stars initially i was not crazy about the flavor you can easily taste an after taste but this stuff really grows on you and i actually started craving it it is now my favorite protein powder mix i want to buy other flavors from this company this review was written because they offered me a free container
love these  they work so well and are faster at warming up than i thought  the only problem i have is the zippers unzip easily exposing the warming sheet  sometimes if i leave the slippers out and people walk over them and hit the chord the warming sheet comes out of the slipper complety  its an easy fix though  just link a small ziptie to each zipper on each slipper hey i made a rhyme and the warming sheet wont come out
great for scrub making
i am heavier and this stool is very sturdy problem i found it slides easily on linoleum floors

i confess i probably drink more alcohol than i should sometimes none sometimes more than advised can you relate im sorry but american politics drives me to drink im pretty good at eating healthy for the most part but i do confess i love gin i took just a plain milk thistle capsule for years and that seemed to give me some protection from the occasional or not so occasional indulgence but when i ran out i stopped taking it and ive noticed my liver goes through phases of not being happy and acting up just a bad feeling a nagging almostpainwhen i was offered this total liver formulation at a discount in exchange for my honest review i thought id try it because i knew i needed to get back on something to help protect my liver its got the milk thistle i know from past experiences is very effective but it also has other ingredients that have been scientifically proven to help protect the liver the best protection of course is not to overdo but if youre going to be bad this formulation is a good insurance policyi did try to take less than the fourpillsaday dosage but i didnt see any improvement until i took it as recommended then i started getting some relief from that crummy sluggishliver feeling
a small allen wrench has to be used to adjust the length of pencil sticking out of holder  not an easy task for a person with parkinsons
super cute at first but turns ugly brown and stained the tub
they were ok but lost them easily since they are so small be sure to use the little case
these worked well they are thin and i stretched it too much making the plastic wavy otherwise its a great product
sprays on in a fine mist love this
moringa is so nutritionally dense that its referred to as the miracle tree this powder is easy to stir into drinks drink as tea or add to smoothies i highly recommend itthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
super cute and big it was a gift and she loved it
we love this type of tissues its super soft and we go through them like crazy its great to be able to buy them in bulk for a great price
good probiotic but too expensive for what it does in my opinion
i love this foot rest i just moved from somewhere with a showertub combo to a place with a separate shower and tub and was wondering if there were any sort of small steps i could use to make shaving easier now that i didnt have the bathtub ledge to rest of foot on this works perfectly ive used it several times now and it feels nice and sturdy though its not meant for sitting or standing on i love the little section thats designed for a razor  i actually put my soap in there so it doesnt stick to the tile it has holes on the bottom so it will drain through which is a nice touch id definitely recommend this
have purchased several times
there have been a plethora of supplements available on amazon that are clearly manufactured in china with laughable chinglish ad copy and over the top photos of usually blonde people having a great time some of them are downright poor quality while others seem to be produced with more care and integrity this falls in the latter category an inscrutable part of the ad copy states compare to physician formulated seeking health there is a claim to check out their awards in the photo section which reveals nothing more than badges stating things like nongmo without mentioning any of the governing bodies that regulate or oversee such claims 100 guarantee etc it states the product is manufactured for a company in florida  there are 10 different commonly used strains the capsules are on the larger size considering the dosage 10 b cfu there is no indication that the product was designed to withstand stomach acid and deliver the full dosage to the gut but is seems to work as expected however i take probiotics daily and have no major issues if you suffer from ibs frequent candida or other serious issues you might be better off with a more well researched combination from a reputable and well known company but for ogeneral use this seems a decent choice
full disclosure i got a huge discount to try these and review them they are more than worth the discounted price but not the 34list price34 nor the 34price34 listed and crossed out they are probably worth the 34sale price34these bottles are solid blue glass the blue is a vibrant shiny bluethey arrived in great condition securely packaged in the box they are a great size for putting diluted essential oils for onthego aromatherapyi cannot give them five stars because i prefer roller bottles with metal rollers because essential oils break down plastic over time that isnt a huge issue as long as you make sure to dilute the oils heavily with a fatty oil as suggested on the package dont make more than you would use in 13 monthsanother thing that contributed to the reduction in stars was that the amazon ad said that a free ebook was included there was no information on how exactly to get the ebook
my go to chlorella brand is no longer available but i found this one which seems basically the same from the size of the capsule down to the mgs ive been taking it for years for overall health benefits b12 detoxifying properties etc  i like that this one is veggie capsules nongmo and free of soy dairy and fillers these are easy to swallow and digest and are ok to take on an empty stomach they are also tasteless and dont cause any after taste or burps not sure where the chlorella is sourced but it would be a huge plus if it was organic
need to put liquid in a squeeze bottle or supply a eye drop to apply
i thoguht allegra was working but i am suffering allergies and its not working added the nasacort as a last ditch and its  not doing anything sigh
i got these for my daughter who works in a secure building and has to wear  badges and now a mask to work she loves color and said these are awesome she said the clip is great to keep the mask adjusted perfectly
the first thing that i like with this brush is the color it looks sleek in design however it is lighweight like an regular toothbrush and has smaller bristle heads you would think they are for kids so it would really depend on your preference if you want those heavier regular or this this would be good for kids though also it comes with two boxes anda lot of extra heads the originalcost seems to be pricey also the sale price but since you get two boxes with extra brush heads its a good value
i like it easy to use dissolves and stays in suspensionas advertised better than expected
this isnt a bad trimmer for the price but i wouldnt describe this as professional by any stretch of the imagination its a beardsideburnhair trimmer made for the hipster crowdthe trimmer body is a cylinder that isnt very ergonomic in its design  which a professional would definitely notice the design is interesting and somewhat artistic in the darkish metalthe entire design of the trimmer is similar to the mercurial style known as steampunk in people who are familiar with that artistic genre the metal parts made of dull metal mixed with shiny metal along with the etched artwork of a bearded man circa 1850 give it that touch it would be a nice gift for that kind of hipster person on your listit operates okay and has a few different interchangeable blades to adjust the trim length it recharges via usb cable and has a blue led display that goes to 99 when fully chargedthere are a few things that make this less than a professional trimmer first the pin mechanism that moves the lower blade when the motor spins is exposed this is to give it the intended style but it also presents a hazard where hair can get caught in the exposed mechanism with a likely possibility of hair getting wound around it and yanked out this is covered in every professional set of trimmers that ive seen and having it exposed would immediately put it into the category of personal rather than professionalthe handle is made of a somewhat shiny metal etched with the artwork but its a simple cylinder without any attempt to create a more natural fit for a hand  in other words not ergonomic for someone who would be holding it for long periods of timethe other thing is that the battery life is decent if youre using it once a day to trim up your victorian era beard and moustache but a professional might not like having to recharge it frequently depending on how much its used to its credit though this trimmer does have a display that will show when the battery is getting low so thats a plus it might just be attractive to a hipster barberstylistone small nitpick is that the blade cover is extremely tightfitting and takes more than a simple flick of the finger to remove i suppose that will get easier as its used more but i have to pry it off using a comb because my fingers arent hard enough to get it to pop offoverall its a decent value for the price but definitely a novelty for the hipster crowd and not made for professional use but because it works well enough and would make for a nice gift it still gets a fourstar rating
these glasses have fantastic style and seemed sturdy i had to return them though because i had trouble seeing out of the clear upper portion of the glasses it was really distorted for me hopefully it wont be for you
i was on the fence about ordering this the reason i keep trying things is because i woke up many months ago with neck pain after trying everything i could think of i went to a chiropractor his adjustments were helping me before insurance denial prevented me from going back he gave me an exercise to perform where i had to roll up a towel lay on the floor and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back that helped some but then i ordered the below devices  4 stars  5 stars  4 stars  4 stars  4 stars  25 starstherefore i decided to add this to my repertoire even though the above devices were good my neck pain never went away and always came back either lightly or in full force every morning after waking up therefore  i decided to try this because a heating pad on my neck sometimes helpsthis neck brace comes with three extra velcro strips a usb power cord no ac adapter and a manual only one of the velcro strips can be plugged in for heat the others are just used as extensions or as a magnetic therapy pad which i think is hocus pocus the neck brace is segment so that i should be able to  flare out the bottom lower on my neck if i want less support rather than more support  i tried this and was unable to get this to flare out i was only able to use this in the strong support modei plugged this into my computers usb port while wearing it there is a control that allows me to have high medium or low heat the heat is nice but it is only in the area where the heated extension strip is and not around the entire neck also i do not find this too comfortable to wear i think this will work with some but for me this is not going to be useful in summary i do feel this might work for some people but it does not work for me the heated area is too small and the brace too tall to be comfortable since i am unable to bring it lower on my neck the current price of 2599 would be reasonable for this had it worked for meupdate i had my boyfiend try this and he hates it he say it only heats in the patch area which is true he gives this 1 star
not impressed
if you only need a quarter of an inch expansion these probably work okay for anything more they just stretch out
im a 60 year old woman who has been fighting against extreme oily skin acne and large pores since my teens this product has absolutely changed my life  ive been using it for six weeks my skin is clear and radiant in a way it has never been before i am able to go without makeup now with no embarrassment about red oily blemished skin i honestly didnt think that would ever be possible for methe first week i used it i diluted it 50 with witch hazel because of the way it made my skin burn and tingle since then ive been using it full strength morning and evening every day sometimes i use it at noon if my nose and chin start feeling oily during the first week a few pimples emerged i think my skin was purging submerged problems however those pimples healed incredibly fast  the spots on my face from old healed pimples have completely disappeared i no longer have huge greasy pores to contend with my skin is soft and smooth and radiant if i feel a pimple start to show up it heals before it actually gives me a problemthis does sometimes make my skin burntingle rather unpleasantly but its only for a couple of minutes before that subsides its well worth the momentary discomfort  worth mentioning is that even when it feels irritated ive never experienced any redness from using it which i do with many other products it doesnt make my skin dry and there has been no peeling for me  it does burn unpleasantly if you get it on your lips so i like to apply lip balm before using itthis is a superb product and an answer to prayers for me i will be trying their other products to see if they are of the same quality i consider it a bargain at any price and at this price its a steal
i found the liquid foundation i use didnt really blend in using the silicone sponge it just kinda sat there on my face not like the brush luckily it wasnt too expensive lord knows ive spent more on products ive used once and threw into a drawer
worked well do not use near eyesas they say
ive had neck pain for years and lived on ibuprofen until i heard about epsom it it works fast my pain is gone in minutes and it lasts no overwhelming odor and it isnt greasy
 nozzle wont stay on
smells great i have to keep using to find how long its effects last
there are 6 individually wrapped large bath bombs in this set in the shape of pastry shop delectables each bath bomb is fragrant but smells the same to mei tried the one with the plastic rainbow on top i had to be careful that the rainbow did not wash down the drain the fragrance came through in the foot bath the bomb dissolved in about 10 minutes the performance was good with suds that lasted about 10 to 12 minutes the end result of the bath was almost clear water that was a bright pink there was no staining to my skin my towel or to my foot bath at least the color of the one i tried did not stainthe current cost of 1376 1529 minus 10 for 6 bombs comes to a competitively priced 229 per pastry bomb these are nice bombs and definitely giftable performance is good enough and they are very fragrant
sticky enough to stay and enough to be kind in removing
this product works but it takes a lot i mean a lot of elbow grease even after it has had time to soften the sealer up
my husband swears that this product plus vitamin b complex works like a banana bag you get from the hospital when you are suffering from alcoholism lolim not joking 
my 11 year was diagnosed with severs disease and these have worked so well to ease his heel pain he has a pair in his regular sneakers and a pair in his tennis shoes they have made a huge difference i highly recommend for anyone whos child has the same issue
love it and does a great job but the batterys need replaced ever 2 weeks
these are too short and cheap  no real control possible  i may use them for other applications than my ears
wellrenowned probiotic for ibd other gastrointestinal issues  great because they are usually considered stable at room temperature although sometimes they send them to you cold and then you think you have to keep them refrigerated  considering the relative low price it seems like a good starting point on the road to recovery
this face mask chain is awesomely perfect as a cool high school teacher i have a certain image to uphold as a practical woman i look for the best product to fulfill my needs this face mask chain fits both requirements this chain is my signature color  pink  and keeps my masks close and clean when i can slip them off for a few minutes when away from my students this chain is the perfect weight it doesnt pull or weigh down my maski highly recommend this face mask chain
i ordered this tourniquet to bring with me in my bag when i hike with my dogs  any of us could get an injury requiring a tourniquet  it is a very handy thing to have with you  this one is similar to the other tourniquets i have purchased it is easy to use and light to carry
it works great on my mat love the smell and the easiness of use put it in a spray bottle and bam clean and smelling great the clean relaxing smell of lavender still smelt great a week later i will continue to use this
these plastic storage cases are great for storing items that need to be kept dry and dust free  they work well for masks as well as tissues  there are little plastic edges on the insides of each case to secure items inside  the cases are sturdy and hold up well to being in a purse and they are easy to locate with the bright colors
very cheaply constructed and did not hold together for my elbow would not recommend it
works fine
i wanted to replace the nylon poufs in my shower with something that would last longer this is easy enough to use but it is very soft and has zero scrubbing or exfoliating factor it causes soap to lather up well its probably for someone with very sensitive skin who doesnt like exfoliating i like that the back side can be used to massage the scalp it would be better if this had a loop for hanging
decent kit but the bristles on my brush are already bent
i love this dryer im not coordinated enough to use a brush and hair dryer at the same time this makes styling and drying so much easier its also helpful to freshen up a look later in the day it has 3 modes cool warm hot you can use this right out of the shower or use a blow dryer to partially dry and then use this blower brushgreat for a smooth look have as much volume as you want
i would love to give this higher stars but my body says 1this powder has messed my with gi tract and i spend more time in the bathroom because of iteven at a half dose i have issuesbeyond that  the flavor is very sweet but not badwhen mixing with a blender bottle it takes awhile longer than i would expect but does eventually all get blended togetherwhen drinking it feels a little thick but not badas far as results gowith a half dose my body felt more hydrated but not energized my head actually felt fuzzy  it was harder to concentratewith a full dose and a heavy exercise my results were slightly better as far as my workout stats on my apple watch but not by much  not like the type of results i see when using a preworkoutmy muscles didnt seem to feel more hydratedi got this package in march 2020 and it doesnt expire until 2022 so it lasts awhile thank you so much for taking the time to read my reviewi hope the information that ive provided helps to make your decision a little easierif you found this review helpful please click the helpful button below
theres no difference between the quality of these bags and the usual ziploc bags which is a pro  ive found ziploc bags to last the longest and seal better than other brands the packers logo and color add a fun touch the graphics are well done colorful and stand out well theres some added cost to having the branding but it makes what is normally a boring bag something that stands out
they were melted when i got them
these are essential for a permanent bandage need i have that needs to be changed before showering  i found them by searching for the product number im glad to have found them they are sterile and easy to use
this mask is absolutely fantastic only problem i have is ive ordered 3 white masks and have received 3 black masks the package even says white im not returning the black ones but who ever packages them should know
handle and back of bristles get hot enough to burn  qmaxx made a much better version  it was made as a flat iron with teeth on one plate and receiving holes for the teeth on the other plate  the outer material was heat resistant and was much more difficult to burn your headhands
i really enjoy the quality of this product it isnt cheaply made and looks good i will definitely purchase again
i gave this to a friend with thinner thighs and calves do not recommend for heavy persons with added bulk in these areas sides of tub press uncomfortably against calves or can get only one leg in at a time my friend wears a size 15 shoe and has ample room for his feet
best drink to bye
this is my second purchase of the tropical saccharomyces boulardii yeast probiotic this is not gut flora you are likely to acquire naturally in the western diet regimen the yeast has delivered a noticeable reduction in night vurps i seem to get these wicked revisits in spells for a couple of days however i cant recall an event since ive been taking itseems to have solved my night vurp situation
i am enjoying this product so much  it is something i use nearly every day and every time i do i count my blessings  the quality is exceptional and the cost is so much less than the small packages i have used in the past  if you are after comfort warmth great price and superior customer service you will find it all right here
this protective placard holder is a very well made and thick plastic holder unfortunately the new north carolina placards do not fit this well the top of the new placards extend higher than the holders hook portion you can still use it but it is a little more difficult to hang this is not the fault of the manufacturer rather the fault of the state in its design it does its job but if you have a new north carolina placard be aware this will be a problem
this creatine tastes terrible but great results
this is the third time ive either bought or been gifted oak  navy bibs and i love them  everyone in my mothers group raves about them too  the designs are so cute and can be matched to any outfit  the little cowl neck helps catch drool and random bits of food  theyre lovely quality and a must for any stylish little tot
would not buy again very small and too hard to use
i spent a little more on this item thinking it looked nicer and more substantial in its product photo than the others like it on amazon  was looking forward to receiving it  it arrived about 10 minutes ago and when i opened up the package i was immediately disgusted  it looks like someone took it out and rolled it in dog poop before sending it to me  the label on it says new but it has definitely been used for something  i have never been disappointed in anything ive ordered off amazon but i am a little angry and disgusted at the condition of this item  whoever shipped it had to have noticed it wasnt clean  honestly i want to just throw it away instead of going through the hassle of sending it back but i want someone to see what a filthy disgusting item i was shippedupdate  the seller was nice enough to send me a new footsie roller without being asked to which was very clean and nice and a bonus scalp massage tool which is kind of neat  the effort was very much appreciated and it shows that this seller cares enough to want to make sure their customers are happy  raising the rating to 4 stars because of the great response of the seller in trying to make things rightthe new footsie roller is very helpful when my plantar fasciitis acts up  perfect for massaging and stretching the affected area
this is a good solid wedge it is durable and wipes clean it is higher than most which is what i needed great prodigy really helps my circulation when i sleep
idea and concept great but the adhesion is very poor in order to use these i had to use glue to get them to stay on the shoes
