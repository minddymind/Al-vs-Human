bought this for my disabled son i tried it first and liked it so much that i ordered one for myself finally a brush that works
i mean its a working scale works great looks nice in comparison to my crusty bathroom love that
my mom love it been using for 30yrs
this lavender essential oil already has 102 reviews with a high star rating so i doubt i can add anything unique to say about it  it has a lovely lavender scent and i will be using this to scent my hand made soaps
these are sturdy lomg lasting arch and heel supports they are firm but with some give have a high heel and higher arch supports the only inserts ill use for preventing heel pain and supporting my unusually high arches
i have 3 large dogs and it can some times be a chore to brush their teeth every morning  however with this full surround finger toothbrush brushing is so much easier and faster  my dogs dont seem to fight me as much as when i was using the regular toothbrushes or the other finger brushes  one of my dogs shes the youngest at 16 mos old almost seems to enjoy her morning brushing  this toothbrush is really soft extra soft which is my 1 concern  i wish the bristles where a little less soft sometimes i wonder if their teeth are really getting a good cleaning because the brush is so soft  its great to massage their gums  this brush has made a world of difference for my dogs  they let me brush their teeth  its great
easy to use and wash nicely love having the supply of these to grab and go
i purchased this because i recently started taking online classes again and i will be spending more time in my desk chair poor body mechanics can cause back pain breakdown of joints etc this cushion was just what i needed to help me obtain good posture and prevent a sore booty
sometimes we often need a fork and dont want to have to wash one upweighing the disposable factor against the use of water and soap for one fork is sometimes stressfulthese forks eliminate that 100 compostable and disposablethese are more like the salad size fork but could be for smaller kids who cant yet manage a bigger forkdurable and better for the environmentpretty happy with these and i know theyll last a long time in my house in the event i need to get more  ill definitely get thesefyi the bigger fork is from a different set these are the forks on the right
cute christmasthemed cover with invisible zipper that will fit any standard cushion and liven up the living room its soft to touch and kids love it its a nice fun splash of color
great for nails
its the real deal love it
simple shoe brush  works as expected nice cover flap
my husbands nice prescription glasses lost one of their nose pieces and we didnt want to go back to the eye doctor so i found these on amazon and decided to give them a try  they were the perfect replacement for the one he lost and are exactly the same quality as those that came from an optical dispensary  there are enough in this package that i probably wont ever have to buy another pair
bulk supplements are the best ive found i have been doing alot of research on supplements and i love this company for a few reasons mostly the purity of the products no fillers on what i have gotten and the price is affordable so i am more happy to try new items i started researching these items for my cats glucosamine helps cats bladder tissue rebuild the chondrotin helps prevent damage to the bladder lining  i only use this company for my cats because their systems are so delicate and having the supplements in powder form helps with dosing and the purity is a great bonus now i am trying new supplements for myself and i have this company to thank i will be a life time buyer
this product was very easy to put together and i love that i can use my own floor product it sprayed nicely and evenly and didnt leak the pad secured nicely to the base with velcro and you can throw the pads in the wash it is as pictured and does a nice job
this snack is really delicious and its packed full of energy
i do not like nuts so hard to find a protien bar wo them these taste good and are very fillingsurprising for how tiny they are company stuck some extra samples in the box which was nice hubby had to eat the nut one the lemon was great and i will order it next
great prank gift
these are soooooooo tiny and cute and great size for travel but really hard to dispense from i filled one each with lavender peppermint frankincense purify serenity sunny citrus and tea tree none of them would dispense even one drop i had to shake shake shake you dont get a very accurate portion that way and sometimes id see a film develop on the water of my travel diffuser so i knew something had come out but what a pain no drops  im at a loss for how to actually use the oils from these little jars you cant use a dropper unless you use separate ones for each oil and of course take off the reducer otherwise youll contaminatemix due to residue of each oil in the dropper and who is going to carry around 8 droppers how do you get these to work suggestions
battery connection isdelicate be gentle
all three of these broke with minimal ease of use within minutes  do not buy i paid 10 for pure trash
i almost wish someone i knew would have a birthday soon just to have an excuse to gift one of these bags i ordered the all occasion bags with balloons and it was much better than pictured  the material is sturdy better than your typical gift bag found at a 99 cent store and quite attractive it doesnt say happy birthday but it seems the holiday best suited for using these bags though the bag could also be used for promotions graduation gifts and anything celebratory note that the handles looking like shoelaces are packaged separately and you have to insert them by hand into each one i found this to be a little bit of a pain but i guess it made it easier to ship overall im happy with it
i love this have it at the head of my bed and i use it every single night it blocks out noise
hair drags concerned about damagedoesnt heat hot enoughdont buy
tastes yummy and its good for you im lactose intolerant so i cannot drink other protein drinks im addicted to caffeine and coffee tasting products
excellent for allergies unlike the the overthecounter meds these herbs have no side effects
not the best but good for the money
as a healthcare worker i wear masks 14 hours the straps dig in my ears causing blisters a n95 mask would be better but all we get all the thin disposable masksthese strap extenders take the straps off the ears the silicone extender is barely noticeable finally my ears are getting some relief
i paid more money than i want to admit for a custom acrylic tub in a 35 year old bathroom  it can only be cleaned with vinegar  yeh  so this hella expensive tub is a pain until i got these magic erasers oh em gee the scum just rolls off the tub and it looks brand new  i do not know how i would keep it clean without them because vinegar is a great cleaner and i use it a lot but you need something to 34scrub34 with that wont scratch  voila
these are perfect for home manicures
is pretty good stuff and will buy again  thank you
i got the giggles as this thing made my daughters hair and scalp quite literally squeaky clean her hair is insanely thick but very fine and also long weve been battling dandruff for years and tried everything this has been a terrific help and it somehow doesnt tangle her hair in the process im absolutely stoked on this thing and so grateful i stumbled across it
came leaky
this was fine except for two things1  its thicker than i thought  it would not fit in the side pocket of my purse2  the one i received the top open too easily  just a baby bump against the closure and out popped all of my pillsso i returned this item
as expected fresh product date perfect
im sorry but i just couldt manage to make this fit in my ear well enough to block sound as designed despite repeated attempts
good price and work very well
works well but i dont get why they are using glass which breaks easily and is dangerous especially when u consider that most of us will stand on it barefootedweigh ourselves naked etc surely luciteacrylic would make more sense
originally i thought these files would work just like my crystal nail file from perfect formula a file i have had for years my nails were all finally strong healthy and grown outafter using these files my nails are shredding peeling and down to the nubs several of the top layers of my nails are peeling back even further some nails have 2 3  4 cracks up the nail i just had a horribly painful crack and it tore to the skini thought all these crystal nail files would be the same but they are not
this is the 2nd one ive bought i purchased this because it was dual voltage and we were headed to ireland i used it at home and i really liked the hot brush but the flat iron not so muchthe plates dont touch when i used it in ireland the digital temp display got really hot burned out and stopped working i was about to throw it out and tried one more time to use it and the brush got hot but no digital temp display i used it for the rest of our trip but when we got home it wouldnt turn on  so i ordered another because it really does cut down on my styling time people mention the problem with the button placement but you can lock the temp by double clicking the offon button a couple of times once it reaches the temp you want
the awesome and perfect cloth mask heres my longest review ever and why this is the awesome ppe for mewe have several other masks cloth and disposable masks to compare these masks against i must tell everyone these masks rockseriously this mask is soft soft like a high quality tight woven brushed cotton and soft tshirt that feels so good i cant wait for it to be washedmade in the usa by americans look up their websitei dont know them but i know where they are and they stopped production and are only making face masksthe mask has adjustable ear loops a pouch for inserts like those charcoal filters if you so choosethe mask is so comfortable but here are more reasons why i will wear this mask every time i can because of a unique feature of the strap that goes behind my head furthermore not putting pressure on my head or neck simply rests on my back so i can take the mask off when safe and it simply hangs on my chest or lower no longer having to put it in the visor risk it touching anything but my shirt period i dont have to look for it when i get out of the truck or put it in the pocket my phone was in as cellphones are nasty even though you clean them because i simply raise my mask up by the ear loops and slip it on my ears and snug the strap if its loose double layer full coverage mask from bridge of my nose to under my chin comfortable all day i dont use the carbon filters if needed i would  put a disposable mask in the pocket area on a as necessary basisi dont think i have been so excited about a product since my first boom box just kidding since my iphonethese comes in two different sizes i wear the xl i have wide cheek bones and im chubby my spouse wears the large and has a narrower jawline shaped face and chubbythank you buttonsmith for your part in helping with covid19 by producing more comfortable ppe its hard enough as it islastly mine were shipped out a bit faster than expectedi ordered more
the yellow shelf fell apart in my hand as i was trying to install it  as i tightened the wingnut it unscrewed itself from the wood  ill need to get some glue and see if that will fix it
not just this one but others that i tried just do not work when training a puppy  on this one  i cleaned the pee spot and sprayed it on  puppy went back to the spot and peed next to it  it would be funny if i wasnt peeved
i have spent years making homemade bread for my family and one of my most important tools has been a plastic dough scraper i got from a king arthur seminar several years ago without explanation my scraper simply disappeared without a trace and no one knows what happened to it i think it got tossed in the trash by accident i went about finding a replacement and after looking at a number of products i chose this one based on the price and the positive reviews it has proven to be a good tool a little different than my old scraper but still fine for my needsinstead of plastic this one is stainless steel encased in silicone there are a couple of important factors here first because of the silicone shell the scraping edge is soft and pliable this is helpful for scraping around crevices and getting as much dough from a round plastic bowl as possible  because of the stainless steel inside the whole is stiff though still slightly bendable which allows it to flex just enough to clean the bowl of my stand mixer without fatigue or permanently getting warped or bent it is stiffer than my old plastic scraper and while this is a positive thing it does require getting used to itunlike my old plastic scraper this one will work on a hot saucepan thats good news for when i am making candy and dont want to wait for the syrup to cool and harden requiring a lot more effort to remove i did not find any statement regarding the temperature limit for this scraper but based on other silicone utensils i have it is probably safe up to around 400 degrees fandsilicone is more nonstick than plastic so cleanup is a little easier it was never bad with with my plastic scraper but it did require a bit more effort than this new scraper just because of the nature of the materials of eachim very pleased with this scraper it meets the need i had and it is better than my old plastic scraper that i used for years it works well it can be used on hot or cold cookware and it is very easy to clean its reasonably priced too based on my experience this is a very easy product to recommend
wow i wasnt expecting this dual sided silicone body brush to be as amazing as it is i use the same amount of body wash as usual and lots of soft foam is produced the bristles are soft but very effective even if they dont feel that way at first the other side is nubby and works nicely for feet knees etc its a little heavy but not overly dries quickly and i can even sanitize it
tried the detox via the ion foot bath at a friends house they had a very expensive machine being cheap i looked at various machines and settled on this one works like a champ and glad i bought it because of the 5 yr warranty and being stateside was the clincher have used it many times on a regular basis 2 days on and one off easy instructions cant go wrong i threw in ton of salt to see what would happen alarm went off and reset it use very little salt great product and fast delivery worth it
bought it for my father in law to help with the cancer and it irritated his skin must find right portion to use maybe
steaming veggies in bags is absolutely the way to go to get perfectly steamed veggies in less than a couple minutes  you just stick the veggies in the bag unzip the adhesive area flip the flap over toss in the microwave and cook for the time you want to get the veggies as you like them  example i like asparagus still slightly firm  i can cook 12 pound in these in about 2 minutes tops  follow their time instructions and tinker a bit to get veggies the way you like them  no pots no steamer devices no mess  im your basic guy who doesnt like to cook  these are perfect
generic brand of vaseline seems to be identical to name brand multipurpose and handy to have on hand i have tried one other product from solimo a spray sunscreen and have been very happy with it seems to be a quality line of products
this does what its supposed to  it holds my mask in place securely without hurting my ears
for some reason the pharmacy we use dispenses our medicines in adult proof packaging after a real struggle we take the pills out of that and put them into these little bottles we peel the labels off the pharmacy bottles or paper cartons and tape them to these the lids are easy to open but stay shut in a pocket or purse i would not recommend if you have children or grandchildren around
returned  small and cheap
too many wild designs rather 10 of solid colors
love their products
i found this mouth guard several years ago and have been a fan ever since  i hated the expensive ones the dentist made as well as the boil and fit ones in the drug store  this mouth guard is comfortable you hardly know it is there  it does the job  i highly recommend it  mine last about a year
the ingredients of this fish oil is great it works great for me and i heard its great for lower cholesterol
i use this and nonstick pads instead of bandaids i have bad reactions to the adhesives on bandaids and this tape saves me everytime easy to cut the shape you need
has a point not normally found on carbide files
these are cute and my son loves themi just wish there was more option in style like mario or luigi on the bandaids not just the 34enemies34 and more than 20 bandaids in the package
i consume this in smoothies and it is easily blendable 1 serving is a small scoop around a tsp size so it really lasts that said in that small amount you are getting a supplement highly enriched in the daily value of vitamin a and b it is a cracked cell wall form so the nutrients are bioavailable i didnt expect it to taste very good so i try to hide the flavor with fruits for example but it still kind of tastes like i am drinking a vitamin
i work in the yard a lot esp this time of year and my feet would start aching started using blue emu foot therapy cream and i now have no issues  also this cream smooths out the slight cracks in my heels
im not totally sure this is helping this whole pandemic thing has messed with everything but the fact that these are a capsule instead of a powder is a winner for me i cant stand the taste of most of those things and just that alone is a turn off i was totally skeptical but while im not sure how much of a benefit they are i can say that they havent caused any negatives so that alone makes them worth a try
i wont buy this again for 62 a bottle theres no way this shouldnt be organic  i would buy it again if it was
this is the perfect item for those whose vision is impaired  my stepmom has macular degeneration and this was ez for her to operate
these work well inflation is easy and completely adjustable
the convience  the durability  makes things faster in shower getting ready for work 
this is the pill case i have used lots of these things over the years and this one is it the rainbow coloring is so cheerful first off who wants a boring old pill container when you can have these beautiful colors to look forward to every morning and evening not me give me a rainbow any day to make popping that fish oil a bit more pleasurable speaking of fish oil this container is huge you can fit a lot of pills in each compartment so you can go to town with your vitamin gobbling without worrying about running out of space the tops of each pill container pop up nicely with the little levers and the whole thing is like a transformer you can take off one day or two or whatever for traveling and leave the rest at home very happy with this purchase
these are some of the best protein bars ive ever had delicious and no chemical aftertaste every flavor is great but the white chocolate cookie is my favorite
the price on these is too high they work somewhat as intended but are more likely to be worth about 2
i received this 2 weeks ago and it was very good  i open and close it 3 times a day  the hinge is already noticeably loose  i dont expect it to last long
very good product that helps reduce symptoms when its impossible to avoid all high histamine foods every day i appreciate being able to get two bottles at a time bc sometimes i need more than 1 bottle a month sometimes you need two caps a day not just one
they are beautiful and exactly like pic
handle is very wobbly and the manufacturer will not all returns
no i dont have a baby  i have wicked dry skin thats also sensitive so i thought id give this a shot  and it works  i smooth it on in the shower pat dry and my skin feels so much better  its got a very mild scent which is not at all offensive and its easy to apply  i wish it was a bit cheaper and thats the reason its only four stars instead of five  but its a good product so i suppose its worth whatever its worth right
this tastes horrible and doesnt dissolve in cold liquids  i tried apple juice and it just left clumps tried both adding to cup before and after liquid  i decided to try using it in coffee and it tasted horrible  i added some hot chocolate and it still tastes horrible but slightly less so  i certainly wish i didnt get the 8oz container to start  oh well  so far no major herx reactions  teasel root usually is within a few hours this has been a three doses so far
perfect for elipens and the orange color stands out when in the bottom of a backpack or a purse or whoever you leave them
this is exactly what i was looking for for my vape waxshatter now i just need to figure out who to buy the dual coil dabber
i purchased this for my sister and she loves it  the animal covers make this such a cute and practical gift
these are great roller bottles for using with my essential oil recipes love them
great little curing iron
i have been taking the etana immune blend supplement and i like it it contains the key ingredients to help protect my immune system these capsules are standard size and easy to swallow also there is no bad taste or aftertaste well see how it holds up as america reopens from the pandemic
scraped my shin down to the bone  i use these daily to protect my shin  so easy to use
i opened the box and looked at this curler and then read the instructions  am i suppose to shove the end of my hair into the open end  does it pull my hair in and around the round device inside the holethere are no instructions about how exactly to use this and there is only one picture showing end of hair in the open hole  so i decided to try this out  the music is cute but not really neededtried different ways of trying to get my hair in it and finally it pulled it in and stopped  my hair was jammed around the insidenow im sitting here and hoping it wasnt going to burn it before i can figure a way to get my hair out without cutting iti just kept pulling while pushing the button  after 10 mins i finally got my hair out of it  packed it up and wont try it againill stick with a regular curling iron
ive suffered from migraines for about 11 years technically i just get the migraine auras plus strong light sensitivity that irritates my eyes these glasses do help although they arent going to completely fix your problem according to medical studies green light is the easiest light on the eyes and brain for people who suffer from migraines the green tint is soothing reduces how much bright lights normally irritates my eyes and helps to prevent getting a migraine to be clear i get some migraines when wearing these from time to time but they still help in reducing light sensitivity and reducing chance of getting a migraine i also like that it has the green part of the glasses on the side to protect light coming in from your peripheral vision i wear them daily at work when staring the computer all day
who doesnt like bath bombs well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me these bath bombs are great they are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath the fragrances these have are fantastic i tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to plain vanillayou get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over 20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it these come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me i will probably have to get these again when i am out the only one i am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint but that is because i just dont like that fragrance but it will come in handy when i have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses
i had not heard of dmannose and cranberry supplement until a few months ago when i was desperately seeking relief from utis every few months id been taking apple cider vinegar cream of tartar and baking soda which works well but takes too longafter the first sign of another uti i took three of these for 5 days and i stopped having any symptoms from day one it never did turn into a fullblown uti ive been taking one a day ever sinceim so thankful to have found this as utis are so painful and irritating its nice to have something that will help keep them away though this is a bit expensive it works very well i might look for a coupon or shop around when i run out but i would absolutely recommend taking dmannose and cranberry supplements
this isnt moisturizing but just runny dont waste your money and get the simple vaseline that we all know
i agree with first reviewer too thick does not appy easily tends to stick to plastic tube applicator tip not metal like muro 128 very bad product not well formulated for humans would not use on the dog either
this is a huge spatula  i like that it is almost straight indeed i was hoping it would be completely straight up and down unlike a turner  note the picture where i compare this wood spatula to my pink silicone and ss turner that is much more angular  i wanted to have something with a firm base but a straighter design because a friend showed me that her straight up and down wooden spatula puts a lot less stress on the wrists when breaking up big batches of ground beef and shifting them around  i tried to purchase a silicone head straight up and down spatula from le creuset but for my intended use it was a waste of moneynot firm enough and with too narrow of a head  i am really looking forward to using this instead  i do wish that instructions for the proper care of the wood apart from not putting in the dishwasher were included as i am unused to wooden implements  also there are a couple of slight indentations in the wood on the very bottom edge of the spatula this may be customary in natural wood products but i simply dont know if it is  but other than that i am pleasedpotential customers may be interested to note that this is large definitely larger than most turnersspatulas i have previously encountered that the bottom is almost but not quite flatstraight across and that the corners of the bottom curve in ever so slightly in addition to the slight angle of the mostlystraighton head  it can be hard to tell details from pictures  i received this item at a discount in exchange for leaving an unbiased review and i count myself lucky as i had basically been looking for precisely this item
i used to give out homemade candy for my auxiliary ladies they were a hit
cant taste this at all i put it in my coffee in the morning when i remember  but i do like the fact that you can mix it with anything stir and youre done no after taste isnt in the bottom of your cup would recommend
exstreamly cheaply made
this is all new to me what a wonderful extract i have used it for a week or so and i feel more energy and overall well being i purchased this for a discount for my honest opinion
i like these loofah soaps these however seemed like the loofah was placed too close to the edge in the past they were in the middle of the soap bar but i like the soap the scents and the price will try again
worked great at first then stopped working right after return window was closed 
does a great job cleaning
great item good price fast ship
i got this to mix with water to put magnolia leaves in per things i read  it worked and the magnolia leaves are not brittle and work and look good in an arrangement
strong electric motor quality construction works very well
does no work at all very disappointed received it over the weekend and added some as directed but it was still slipping  and to add the wax got into one of my lens and now the lens is blurry and stained so technically my glasses got messed up because of this product
this was easy to swallow  unfortunately did nothing for me
i also purchased this with a groupon and its a piece of junk it barely heats up at all and does very little to curl my lashes wish i hadnt thrown the packaging and stuff away bc id return it if i could i like my panasonic one much better although you have to hold the switch down to get it to heat i bought this one thinking it would heat while i was doing other things which it does it just doesnt curl very well
as described you cant beat the price ive used the big name brand ones and this brand does the job well
not a lot to say because its so simple but it works perfectly well and is great for people with fobs or separate keys they need to get apart quickly
elegant it is and heavy too just a note to make sure the suction pad is tight before hanging the squeegee  it hung best against the glass shower door not so much on the wall  besides its sleek look it functions pretty awesomely with its long length to cover a wide area and the rubber worked well to pull the moisture off the surface  a good squeegee
they are adorable
i tried to remove baked on gunk on my cookie sheets but not very successful these fell apart after use with a little elbow grease wont buy again
didnt feel much change in the fridge
i highly recommend this walk air purifier works extremely well specially if you have a small room
these are so stiff that it takes a lot of pressure to plunge the syringe instead i end up losing some of the meds before my dogs and cats get their full doses not great when youre trying to administer meds while holding a squirmy angry pet plus they are literally single use they get stuck after 1 use and cannot be used again
great supplement quality and quick and packaged well
a little too high and deep for a neck pillow for me but works great behind the knees or in front of my other orthopedic pillows to elevate my legs or to ease my spine nicely made no smell soft at the very top but firm at the core very comfortable for knees and legs wide enough for larger than average legs although very large or very heavy legs may wear it out sooner  im a tall gal big gal with longer than average legs its holding up quite well for me after several months nice zippered pillow case  im happy with it  i hope they continue to manufacture these because when this one wears out i will rebuy if you sweat a lot you might want to cover it with a towel to make it last longer this material breaks down in damp and humid air hence it will get flatter sooner so keep it dry
this polisher did exactly what i wanted it to do
i have been purchasing and using eo lavender hand cleansing wipes for years  eo products are the very best quality in overall product generation  the lavender fragrance with essential oils is beyond amazing  cant say enough about how much i truly love and enjoy
the photo showed a container with 32 onces of hydrogen peroxide but the description is for half of that  the price is exorbitant if you only get half of what is shown in the photo
sprayer doesnt work very little comes out and difficultgets stuck when you press down to spray
i admit i bought these because i couldnt find my normal disposable wipes anywhere i didnt think id be impressed but in 2020  you make do well i am so pleasantly surprised with these not only are they super soft but they do the job well thanks
i tried this out right away on some wood handle knives we have  absorbed in quick and really conditioned the very dry wood they go through to dishwasher which is horrible to do to any knife let a lone a wood handled  seems to leave a finish on the wood that should work to protect it from water  super easy to use and no bad odor  love the food safe aspect and im going to use this on the wooden cider press i have  great product
i bought this to keep with me on my recent trip to several asian countries those countries are notorious for not providing soap in restrooms this travel soap worked perfectly for my needs i am incessantly needing to keep my hands clean and this helped my mild obsession i also wear contact lenses and require clean hands for handling the contacts i never got an eye infection despite the questionable water supply ill attribute that safety to the good soap i was using buy it
very comfortable hopefully wont have to use one again but it was a great choice bevause you can pump it up to ur contour it inflates around ankle amd shin area 
i wish they were different grades of courseness but these are all the same and a little too course but ok
i really like this jewelry organizer it has lots of compartments for all my bracelets to fit securely it has some zippered pockets too i cant wait to travel with it
this ice pack works on small area like my handbut comes out of the freezer very hard i need to wait a while for it to soften and be more comfortable but i do like that it is not bulky or difficult for me to hold
if you must save on space consider these laundry soap sheets  i will be honest though hotel bar soap and baby wash made my clothes smell and therefor feel cleaner to me when doing laundry in the sink  the soap sheets were easier to rinse out than the alternatives but i do appreciate a good sudsing  one time during our trip i ended up with a shirt so stinky after one day on a train and i am not a stinky woman usually that these sheets made the shirt a lost cause  ill blame it on the turkish food but man these things could not keep up  i ended up trying a combination of hand sanitizer bar soap this stuff and downy spray but the initial wash seemed to 34set34 the stink
neat concept but the design still needs work when working properly it is convenient to have the capability to store snacks in one side or water and a preintraworkout it is however not without flawleaking i have one of the older versions of this shaker and noted leaking as a main issue this was supposed to have been one of the areas of improvement on newer models but its still not perfect yetdurability 1 drop from no more than 2 feet rendered the shaker useless
this is the best bum cleaner everim a big girl and gained a bit more weight during the pandemic and started having issues reaching to clean my bum in the shower it wasnt pretty let me yell youi did some searching and comparing and settled on the butt scrubberi handle is long the yellow head is made of some type of silicone and very sturdyi got in the shower and soaped it up and got to work and trust me this device gets in there and cleans everything my cheeks are tight so wrapping a towel around the head is out of the question my bum is much cleaner these dayswhen im finished i soap it up rinse and place it upside down in a container solution of white vinegar and water and let it soak for a whiletrust me your bum will thank you for it
i cant smell this but for just a micro second after spraying it  it initially has a little bit of a bleach smell but then nothing  i sprayed some in my daughters really stinky running shoes and it helped a lot  i could use this in a gallon size since we have pets and stinky tennis shoes  it seems to work as advertised so unless it stops working i think it deserves 5 stars
fine quality tasty broth if you have been consuming bone broth the price and the quality do correlate this is topshelfmuch better than  expected
still taking and evaluating
this product is far superior for sweaters and bras
great compression stockings my mom loves them and the quality is really good they dont run easily
im a true believer in the red light therapy camp ive had excellent results myself and have seen the same on others that being said i have a bad neck and was hoping this would be flexible enough to use there and hopefully improve it it does the job but is really hard to get it into place its easier on my shoulder or leg but i wish it was curved in shape for where i need it ill definitely use this but am still in search of
got it yesterday i am so delighted with this product i have kind of fine hair after my hair was washed and dried within minutes as a first time user my hair looked professionally done totally excellent certainly worth the money i am usually not handy with my kinky curly hair and i dread washing as i will have to fix it again to look presentable i would give this a 10 star if i could
this is the most yumm and perfect chocolatebeet powder  i use it in baking  its the only way that i can get my grankids to eat beets i use it in red velvet deserts too with red gel coloring for extra brightness  this has a great taste on its own even tho it has a bitter quality but that is part of the life of brilliant untreated chocolate  it blends into hot cocoa cream cheese batters whipped cream and when i whip cream into butter for a different spin on things and at that point i will add coconut sugar that has been finely ground into the whip as well to work on bringing sweetness there really is no limit to creation with this product im going to need to get more
i like vegetables but sometimes need to fix things quick with less mess and these steamer bags are great  the food tastes real and not like cooked in a microwave  no mess  just toss the bag when done  great
i did not order this for myself but the individual who is using the smelling salts has been very happy with the results ive been told this is how smelling salts should be so on her behalf i highly recommend to those looking for a good smelling salt
i was skeptical about buying this but im so glad i did it absolutely works no more itchy mosquito bites instantly gets rid of symptoms right after use
its ok but you can use your fingers and it does the same

if your an active person this cover tape is what you may be looking for tape provides for a secure attachment of your sensor
i received this item very quickly that said it comes with absolutely no directionsnot even the picture that you see on the web page it arrives in a clear plastic type bagbut nothing else it takes some real getting used to once you put it on its better than a cpap but if you are sensitive to having something on your face this will cause you issues as for snoring ive been told that it has lessened my snoring somewhat but it has not eliminated it
this olive oil looks good smells good and tastes like high quality extra virgin olive oil took off a star because i dont know if this is a reputable company for something i will be consuming also costco is known to have some of the highest quality organic evoo so i usually just buy that
these have and excellent mix of fragrances with strong scents that are great for aromatherapy one or two did smell a little like alcohol which makes me wonder about additives as well as the fact that both rose and jasmine have their fragrances removed through water soluble methods more often than oil or fat soluble ones so i also wonder if those are real but i dont really care too much so whatever smells good its not like im eating it or anything
i love the product
very nice product  we got it to use for an art project and i really dont know the other uses for it lotions maybe  it seems to be very high quality  we only used a small amount so there is plenty left for next year and the price was excellent compared to small bottles sold locally
this fish oil has a pleasant light orange taste  i will repurchase it
these steamer bags are a great way to get your veggies in  i had bought the ziploc brand before for a lot more money but these are just as good quality and much less expensive
though the gray color put me off at first the results were greatsoft shiny hair the smell is strong but it  reminds me of a spa that uses a lot of natural products and i like it
great relief for my knee when i have the occasional stiffness from time to time i have a knee tightness that prevents me from walking straight it normally goes away after 2 days but it is a pain to walk and drag one leg the compression is just enough to make me walk and not strain too much
love how much curl it gives my lashes and they stay curled until i wash my face  the rotating wand is weird or maybe i am  cant figure out how or why to use it  also turning the rotating wand on and off takes a few tries  overall love the product
absolutely love this ive bought so many curling irons and ended up throwing themout because they dont get hot enough to curl my hair this definitely does the job i got the perfect curls with this and i just received the item yesterday curled my hair for a photoshoot with my son i have a lot of hair and thick hair and i didnt have a hard time what so ever highly recommend also got here right on time
i think these latexfree gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves they are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves i have worn regular latex gloves a lot especially when making my hand made soaps but i will be wearing these from now on i dont think im allergic to latex but i used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe i am these latexfree gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while
during the cold months of winter it is nice to use a furniture polish which shines up all your wood desks bookcases and tables i love endust because it makes wood glow with natural beauty and keeps dust at bay for at least a while until you can dust again i like that this leaves no greasy or oily residue it wipes off clean the scent is pleasant too and that makes cleaning more fun i find it works best to spray the cleaner onto a clean rag that way there is not over sprayingthe rebecca review
bought this for my sister to improve her grip strength she loves it and its adorable too
very soft works great
its  smells like my hair is always burning and the plates  dont seem to keep my hair straight  for more then a few hours
this smells so good and really does help detangle and defrizz my toddlers hair  we like it
its difficult  to hold especially  when the suds hit ur hands this needs to be a lil smaller but its not hard on the sclap
reviews for first aid products like this are more passfail than 15 stars the product packaging will hold up and keep the tube sterile the tube itself appears to be well made so yes i can recommend purchase for your first aid kit pass
how can i describe my exhaustive search for an applicator bottle for my hair oils that has a long tip so that you can part hair with it hair color applicator bottles are expenive and i just didnt want to pay that price anymore i want a nicely organized beauty closet so i was searching for applicator bottles to store my hair oils to ensure they dont spill over and have the long tip to make partings in my hair  sooo glad i found this bottle i will be ordering more to put each type of natural oil in them and will look nice in my closet really happy with this purchase the bottle is soft and squeezable and you have to cut the tip off to make an opening its also the right size not too tiny like whats in a craft store and not too big like many hair coloring bottles just perfect i can see the value of storing your crafting liquids in this and consider it for your beauty needs too  really happy
i have been taking apple cider vinegar with mother gummies for years this brand has more than just apple cider vinegar it also comes with b vitamins and other ingredients
i prefer the nasopure system kit for sinus irrigation because i can control the flow and the nozzle tip forms a better seal with my nostril than traditional ceramic neti pots the buffered salt solution is less likely to cause any irritation and its premeasured easy peasy just mix and apply a light squeazythe neti pot has been around for hundreds of years and when used properly it is the safest and most effective remedy to clear my stuffy sinuses and help relieve postnasal drip i cannot use the over the counter sinus meds because some make me drowsy and others give me palpitationsplease read1 the most important rule to remember and this is not optional is to never use tap water under any circumstances if you must use tap water let it boil for just over a minute or san and allow it to cool to room temperature before using  distilled sterile water is recommended and you can buy it in the grocery store2 if you are unfamiliar with the proper technique for using a neti pot there are many instructional videos on youtube this should be a safe and relatively comfortable experience3 clean the netipot after every use and let air dryplease follow ollow the instructions and read recommendations on the fdas website to ensure safe use and youre good to go if you found this review to be helpful at all please take a moment and click the button below to let amazon know thank you so much  
while this product might not be for everyone for my situation its fabulousi have to watch every drop of water i use each of these generously sized mitts is in its own individual pouch as opposed to the more common dry mitts or cleansing towels that you add water to these are presaturated with a soapy smelling solution that cleans every inch of your bodya quick rinse and youre done with almost no water usagethis would be great for campers as well
im very happy with this set all four items came individually wrapped and they are all pretty nice quality especially given the price for all of them there were a couple loose stitches here and there but nothing majorthe glove has a cute pattern and a hole on each side of the bottom so it stays on your hand the loofah side feels nice and the exfoliating side actually works it makes my skin feel noticeably smoother after just one use but its not so rough it causes discomfort on my very sensitive skin the back loofah is especially nice and the material is very soft the regular loofah works very well and i actually had to start using less body wash on it because it works up ample lather with just a small amount they all have handles to hang them up to dry overall im happy with this purchase
i bought these to dress up my fence they look really great ive put different flowers and plants in them and they look really awesome on my fence
we had a couples baby shower and this game was part of the fun both the boys and the girls wanted to try to get their sperm directly on the egg
love this heated eyelash curler has 3 heat settings it does get hot its chargeable which is great and comes with extra styling tools with it hade a case or pouch to carry it all
this gel knee support comes in handy when i have a weak knee  periodically my knee tends to give out  with this i feel much more support to the area  this is a nice quality support with gel padding on the front where the front of the knee isthe material is strong  and most important breathable  oftentimes if you dont have breathing material it can become tight and sweaty  there is no opening just slip if through the food  i can do this while exercising because staying in place is importantcheck the sizes for sure before you order  mine is the xlarge and i am not large but the tightness is fine  maybe i should have received a smaller one but  right now this one worksnice support  good quality fit  review for gel knee support
i use this as my daily probiotic about a quarter cup a day and it has a wonderful taste  i would recommend to anyone
so we called this my husbands leg condom  due to an infection he had his prosthetic knee replacement removed and then six weeks later a new prosthetic knee implanted  this allowed him to shower with his leg restraint on without worry of contaminating the incision or getting his dressings wet  it looks really weird at first with the whole disc thing but it does work and is long enough for even a tall guy to use  it is tight so dont expect to wear it for a long twenty minute shower  highly recommend
people take curcumin for the antiinflammation benefit i dont personally notice anything from taking a lot of curcumin from many companies considering the relatively high price for curcumin i would like there to be a more noticeable benefiti measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them which is close to what i expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients it means these capsules have minimal to no fillers which is what they advertiseyou are after the curcumin not the turmeric so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing the current price is 13 for 90 pills which 144gram the 90pill bottle is 094gram the now brand 60 pill bottle costs 033gram the doctors best 120 pill bottle is 034gram nothing about this bleaf nature curcumin would suggest that it is a better product that is worth such a price premium over the established reputable brandsyou can buy tumeric root at the grocery store if that is what you want tumeric is too bulky relative to the active compounds for it to be a good supplement instead focus on supplements that contain just the curcumin extract and ones that contain more of the desired extract than what is in this pillmade in the usa in gmp certified facility
its honestly so cute i love it i used 7 slots for daily supplements and i use the 8th slot for tylenol
these are not the quality of others i have bought directly from local pharmacy stores  they will not clean in the earonly around the entrance to the ear canal
perfect as an addition to a raffle basket with a sleep theme
this brush has pretty firm bristles almost too firm  i am afraid sometimes that i might break the skin of more tender items like tomatoes although the ring is nice for grabbing it would be easier to use if the bristle area was straight
spirulina powder is kind of one of those trendy health supplements right now so im not surprised by the price especially for an organic producteasy to add into green smoothies and such if you dont put a crazy amount the flavor is pretty easily hidden not bad
i used to drink those ice smoothies at target as a kid taste brings back memories quality is decent for getting a pump
baggy didnt fit properly middle finger was tiny which is your longest finger  sent back
it didnt really help keep my glasses up and wore off after a short while  it may work for people with different shaped noses i think glasses have a harder time staying on mine
very impressed with this item well worth the price
best product on the market for cleaning  i am so glad i discovered these  i use them to clean my tile floor bathtub refrigerator counter tops etc  they clean so well you dont really need to use much cleaning solution if you havent tried these you should
i used it as a roller
i bought a package of two because i was trying to approximate the facia blaster not available on amazon at this time and hoped this would work just as well  probably would have been workable except for two things the octopus top has a face and the nose part of the face is pokey when youre grabbing the top and trying to 34blast34 your facia with it  also i had only been working for about 5 minutes when the top of the first one unscrewed and when i tried to screw it back on again these are two piece massagers that you screw the top handle part onto the bottom fingers part it was stripped and would just spin in a circle and come off again  couldnt be secured in place  if this were a solid single piece construction and a smooth knob for the top it would have been a great option for facia blasting  i think ill just end up buying the actual facia blasterupdate  i had been giving up trying to approximate the facia blaster and was about to buy the product but i had been hearing from youtube reviews that it was taking a long time to arrive and i didnt want to stop efforts to blast while waiting waiting waiting  i found a diy facia blaster online and decided to make one and these little guys are just the ticket  hooray  heres a link to the diy project tutorialhttpwwwwellnessgeekycomhomemadefasciablasteralternativediy
i use these every christmas i used to have a whole bunch of holders and i cant find them was happy to find a kit with 2 holders and 5 scenters a little pricey for my taste but the scent has held up pretty well normally they last about 34 days and then your nose gets used to it
i liked the aroma while opening the box of shower steamers but in the shower they gave a light scent i could smell it in the shower but wish it was a little stronger of a scent i did like the scent so it was pleasantupdate i wanted to update my review a s state that depending on the scent you may have more pleasant aromas  i used another scent out of the pack and it smelled great and had my bathroom smelling like it i think some scents are lighter than others
worked out as exspected
i have reordered many times fast shipping and comfortable
i cant imagine putting this in my eyes even if it was diluted felt like pure cayenne pepper in my mouth
wow i can tell my hair and nails are growing out thicker and stronger and ive only been using this for about 2 weeks it might take you a while to take these if you have trouble taking pills because the serving size is 6 pills i can take 10 pills at once so its no issue for me i understand that this supplement is made from whole foods so it makes sense the serving size is more that one pill you want to make sure it works and it does
i got these to replace the pad on my libman spray mop and these work great they fit well on the head and are secure on the unit the best thing is when these get dirty i have a replacement while the other is being washed
good quality flights and good thickness  wife wanted them and she really likes the way they look
they work for the price cant beat them
creatine monohydrate is the most affordable form of creatine this is also micronized creatine so it dissolves better this dissolves almost instantly in water  i stir it a bit with a spoon the taste of this creatine is almost completely neutral so it blends into any drink the recommendation is to stir this into water non acidic juice or a carbohydrate drink the benefits of drinking creatine is that it helps you increase your energy so you can have more strength and endurance when lifting weightsthe rebecca review
got them for both of my girls and they love it
i think the use of noise cancelling is a little lost in translation but otherwise these were great and came in really handy  when i travel and am in a secured place its nice to be able to block out all the noise and get some good rest  these did an excellent job  i also used them when going to the shooting range and they worked great there also  having the different sizes meant i had an extra pair to give to someone that didnt have proper ear protection at the range the hard carrying case is great to have as well or i wouldve lost them a long time agoto be noise cancelling they would have to produce a counter noise so the use of that term is incorrect but they do block out a good amount of sound  i was very happy with them and had no problems with them at all
i am highly disappointed i have never taken hair growth vitamins but since doing the bc not once but twice in the last 4 years of going natural i did extensive research looking for hair growth vitamins that contained everyrhing i would need for healthy hair i heard great things about hairfinity but decided dasgro had everything my hair needs to grownow let me say this i love the product and wanted to wait till i was done with my second bottle before leaving a reviewreason for the 2 starsi never received my second bottle yet everyday im receiving text messages from the carrier  will be delivered today i had yet received it and when it comes to any type of supplement i like to stay consistent sadly i had to spend more money and purchase hairfinity went to the beauty supply store  hopefully it works just as good as dasgro
pumpkin seed oil is a culinary specilty that is also often found in food supplements its a more readily available form of pumpkin seeds which are presumed to treat bladder irritation kidney infections intestinal worms and trouble urinating due to benign prostatic hyperplasia bph my dad is in his 60s has started to develop prostate difficultiesi advised for him to take pumpkin seed oil capsules and he says that urination is much easier and clinically there are no concerns from his doctor
i think the frequency works for all pests i dont hear sny more scratching near the attic above my bed but i rarely used the night light and it turns on and then immediately off i have bought 3 and it all does that so glad that the unit itself still works perhaps an led bulb for longetivity
works just fine for me clear instructions plenty of refills comes with several preset so you dont have to immediately place the filters in the frames
yum  smells really good  very subtle
i use these in my halo mask they are comfy i can breathe
this big set of shoe inserts has everything you need to make any shoe comfortable  it is very handy
perfect for whay ive used it for  i thought i had kidney stones  worked well
i often find myself using my less accurate notouch forehead thermometer to avoid dealing with the sterilization process following the use of an oral thermometer these digital thermometer sleeves work great and about the only issue i have encountered was removing it from its protective packaging without dealing with extra pieces of plastic
theres not much to describe it is a simple product and i received exactly what i wanted
i mean yeah it makes it convenient it is a complete mineral profile i like that about it but sadly it uses inferior forms of some minerals they used calcium carbonate which is one of the most poorly absorbed calciums citrate is what you want as well as magnesium oxide which is also poorly absorbed  you want malate or gycinate that made me a bit disappointed in this product its not too hard to swallow and goes down easy but in the endits not the best
extra fluffy when new and dry but not so much once wet not as good as the original mop heads but still good for the money
it does what is says it will do removes hair painlessly  it does take significant amount of time rubbing it in a circular motion to remove the hair but it does eventually remove the hair and it does not hurt at all unlike waxing or using an epilator  your skin is exfoliated in the process so it is really smooth afterwards  i was able to do one half of my leg from the knee down on the front before my arm got too tired so i will do a little each day after my shower until it is all donebonus it also works on facial hair that i normally get a wax treatment for  i was looking at my lady lip hairs and it reminded me that i need to make an appointment for a wax treatment then saw this device sitting on the bathroom counter and had a lightbulb momentwould this work on my little bit of random lip hair  i had just washed my face so i gave it a try and it worked  again the exfoliation left my skin feeling smooth and soft and no little hairs needing to either be plucked or waxed  because of this along i have upgraded it from 4 stars to 5 stars now i dont need to schedule a wax appointment and have my upper lip swollen and red all day after the waxing like it usually is  i had no irritation at all from this device  saying goodbye to my every couple of weeks painful waxing appointmentsi had my doubts that it would work or if it did remove the hair it would have my sensitive skin very irritated but i was wrong on both parts  it worked and my skin was not harmed at all  kind of a cool device and cost less than a single waxing appointment too
i really cant believe how good this fish oil tastes  im not sure how they get it to taste this great im just glad they do
shipping took a bit longer than expected good price and value
have a hole in your tooth from a crown falling out it works
this my second brush i purchased but this brush takes too long to heat up and i had the temp on 450
this is a huge urinal for women nothing discreet about this thing i am not going to take it with me at all  i would rather go in the great outdoors instead
not much to say other than these were the size and color i needed
needs smoothed hole edges but i can do that easily myself in a few minutes
these glasses seem to be a wireeh style  they can get easily crushed in man pockets  so im not sure  the frame is too lightweight and lacks the comfort at the ear piece and nose piece  i wanted wider fitting for my big head  so these were good for that purpose  yet when they are on and i am looking thru the glasses i can see the glass frame edges all the time  i since bought another style glasses  and now use these as spares around the house yes they fit around my big head nicely no the lenses are smaller than comfort nose piece is flimsy entire glass frame is flimsy
this raveler sleep mask for woman and man contoured with ear plugs is good at blocking out light but lets some light in at the nose area  this is because the nose area is preshaped like the nose area in a halloween eye mask so that the sleep mask doesnt lie completely flat against the nosesleep masks designed with padded fabric across the lower edge of the mask below the eyes and across the nose do a more complete job of blocking out light see eg   however this sleep mask which comes with a set of rubber ear plugs gives good value for the price less than 6 on amazon  it also has a very wide and comfortable elastic band for holding the mask in place while you sleep
the band i received from withit was the molded style not decal and is amazing  i get tons of compliments on it  it fits my pebble time perfectly  the colors are exactly as pictured  it matches pretty much everything  highly recommend
pros great size good temp control 7 levels very softcon only one you can feel the heat wires when you hold it if youre laying on it you cant tell
i am completely new to gua sha techniques so i thought this roller set would be a good entry point and for the most part it is if you are looking for a set that will allow you to learn the techniques at a good and reasonable price point then try these and upgrade to stainless or real jade at some point in the futuremy big gripe about these is that they do feel a little cheap i am not entirely sure that it is real jade and when the roller arrived the larger roller was popped out of place and i had to pop it back in there but it feels really really insecure in there now if the packaging was better this might not have happened thats okay though because i really just wanted the handsculpting too so i can live with the roller not being great if you are buying this for the roller i would look elsewhere otherwise i would recommend this set as a beginnerentry level piece
great for bugbites and muscle painsspasmsevery home medicine cabinet should have in stock
perfect for summer outdoor parties and weddings
delivers the needed calories with a great chocolate taste
i was looking forward to getting this product for review i received a discount because ive had tinnitus for nearly 25 years because ive lived with it for so long im not surprised that this supplement wasnt effective in my case in fact i wouldve been shocked if it had beeni will continue talking these and i will update my review if i notice a difference
this item is not as good as advertised i read the research paper the product is based on and the statistics looked decent but i am not one of the people this product worked a miracle on i am back to the old acid blockers this product is worth a try but after one bottle if you feel no improvement do not waste your money on another one
i love this set  definitely will be purchasing more in the future this set has everything you need to smooth  shape the nails i highly recommend
collagen is a part of my daily routine usually in coffee since coffee is part of my daily routineeach packet has 35 calories and 9 g of protein all from cow collagen peptidesunflavored so nothing to interfere or overly sweetenpricier than similar collagens and the serving size is larger than some others as wellstill these are convenient packets for on the go the packets are thoughtfully designed very easy to open no scissors needed
this saved me money compared to the disposable pads that the pups like to tear apart
taste went away almost immediately everyone i shared it with said the same exact thing im not sure if stevia gum can be done but this product certainly hasnt cracked the code yet
ive used a few tens units in the past and can state that this might be the most powerful one ive used though this power comes at the cost a shorter battery life it worked for about 30 minutes out of the box though and when fully charged i got a few hoursthis tens unit charges fairly quickly and provides muscle tensionpain relief so i definitely recommend this devicejust a reminder though that there are warnings online to not place the pads near your heart so id advise not using it on your torso or spinal cord
im using these along with a scooter while i recover from a broken ankle  i have arthritis in my shoulders so i this style of crutch works better for me balancing the pressure better for me  these are reasonably priced but still good quality
i will keep them because i could can cut a piece of soft fabric moleskin  to line with first but in my opinion this cushion is worse on the sores than the furniture it is protecting against  it is not a soft gel cushion  its more like the scratchy styrofoam peanuts used in packaging  but thicker maybe i can find a gel pad to line it with i have it two stars because i like the netted sleeve  for az heat that is ideal so it has some value to me and  not worth returning but not soft enough to use for bed sores thats for sure
its a bit of a mess of cords and such but it makes the flight box wonderful to use compared to batteries i dont even use the batteries any more unless im mobile very nice using it lightly for 3 months no problems or breaks so far
this is a great battery it works exactly as you would expect it to so far it has provided us with a long life and it works great im very happy with it
i have always liked the cleaning job mr clean erasers did but i hated the thin pads that wore away quickly and shredded these pads are amazing they dont shred into small pieces  and they scrub hard  dried messes love them for baseboard cleaning and quick wipe downs of nasty messes
i like the oval shape its good for working in between the scapula and spine
i am really pleased that this product came up on my list of items i can review when i saw it i instantly selected it because i know that chlorella is an excellent green superfood i love superfoods and consume them often this one is just chlorella with no spirulina added but if you want both in a capsule its easy to find here on amazon if its only chlorella youre interested in this is a great way to take it i like both the powdered and capsule forms i like the powder for my smoothies but sometimes i dont want a smoothie and the capsules are a great alternative i always feel better and more energized when i consume green superfoods they have a lot of nutrition and naturally occurring minerals there is nothing negative i can find to say about this product
i really love these sponges i hope they never stop making them
soft comfortable and stays warm when heated  highly recommended
these are helpful and dont rub off i forget they are on
fractionated coconut oil is good for making homemade soaps and beauty products but its less potent for hair and body care use  i find the formula thinner but the trade off is that it isnt as greasy and you can still use it for moisturizing your hair and skin without that greasy coconut oil feeling which stains too i have both kinds of oil  the real unprocessed kind for massaging into my hair hands and nails and this kind which is versatile but lacks the smell of coconut but is good as a carrier oil both have their uses and this product is of decent quality  i would just go by price because i dont see any discernible difference between this one and other similarly priced brands of fractionated oil
works wellstays closed
this product is very thin if you are looking for something thin this is the way to go
great scissors but a little small for a mans hands hey who said nurse means womans size
smells better than bonce
my only complaint with these molds is the size two millimeters is too small for an effective dose  the 2 trays should come in a 5ml  10ml size other than that these are spoton id never made suppositories before  was afraid the caps on the bottom would be hard to remove from the directions they came with but the caps pull off easily no twisting needed the pipettes make it easy to fill the molds without any overflow use the pipettes once then toss them and the individual molds  caps are easy to clean with a qtip dipped in alcohol definitely store your supps in the fridge once you make them  stick them in the freezer for 10 min right before using them to prolong the melting time this kit costs more than a 10pk of natural plantbased supps that youll find online but it lets you make as many as you need based on whatever formula suits your ailment good stuff
no more problems with hats being a little too tight fixed 3 ball caps so far love it
love this little thing  i had a moldy smell in my bathroom  getting ready to renovate but until then bought this to help with smell and toxins  after about 3 days the smell was completely gone  amazing  quiet little fan which is not annoying
couldnt be happier with this purchase  colonics have literally saved my life i was diagnosed with a pelvic floor dysfunction which led me to the inability to have a bowel movement on my own and that undoubtily  led to all sorts of problems health issues and diseases autoimmune lupus chronic fatigue epstein barr hypo thyroid hatchimotos sp fibermyelgia   prior to this i was extremely healthy  my career was in fitness but after years of major constipation at least 30 yrs my 34then34 healthy body couldnt fight off the toxins anymore  i became so toxic and sick  there were days i could hardly get out of bed but when i did  all i could think about was when i could lay back down and take a nap againim a mom of a young family  this unhealthiness was unacceptable buy i was clueless regarding what i could do about it  so i decided to doctor at the world famous mayo clinic with the best docs in the world  after months and months of tests the only thing they could come up with was to remove my colon and live with a colostomy bag the rest of my life  i was so depressed but didnt believe i had any other choice  right before my surgery my husband suggested i go see a naturalpathic doctor to see if they could help me in any way they chose to take me on as their most challenging constipated patient client  a big part of regaining my health was getting professional colonics do you know how expensive those things are between 60100  i was getting one a week for 18 months yes thats how impacted i was i knew this couldnt continue doing this as who can afford a lifestyle of this i sure couldnt on my income my extended family felt so badly for me they would gift me with a colonic a month just to help me out  when they could  but i was still paying thousands out of my own pocket to continue this major cleanse i needed  i thought id eventually have to just give in and use the 34bag34 as it was more 34affordable34  thats when i found out about this colonic board best info ive ever received  changed my life  i ordered it immediately it came in the mail that week and i set it up very simple and went right to work  during my first colonic while using it  i had tears in my eyes  it worked what an answer to prayer  no more having to pay for all those professional colonics  on a side note i just finished a radical 8day detox cleanse and using my colonic board daily was a big part of that   i now feel better than i have in years im not kidding  i lost my bloated weight ive got never ending energy my body nor my joints hurt anymore i cant wait to get out of bed in the mornings im happier  no longer depressed etc  i am forever grateful to my new colonic board that has given me back not only my health but my lifeps  just to warn you ive never met a western medical doctor who has approved of this practice so dont expect them to be jumping up and down on your newfound discovery with you but at the same time ive never met a doctor  nor any person who had as bad of a chronic constipation problem as i had
we have a big variety of probiotics that we rotate and use daily  this one has a very impressive label  now i have no way to test any of these claims so i just have to believe them  this one gives more capsules for less money than many others allthewhile giving lots of cfusnot long before the covid19 outbreak i had to take another round of antibiotics  since this wipes out all of the good bacteria in my intestines i stocked up on several different pre  probiotics  my thoughts are that different brands may have different types of good bacteriaafter about two weeks of some serious probiotic dosages which was also in the middle of the covid19 outbreak i got sick  i had a fever cough and shortness of breath  it really started to worry me  it only lasted two days and was gone  i have no proof but i am going to say that my pre and probiotics kept me from getting much sicker and also shortened the duration of my illness
this does wonders for its size my bf and i both have extremely bad allergies especially during season changes this helped us to get amazing sleep without stuffed noses ever since i got it it takes about a day to sanitize the air i have it in an 15x10 room also my guinea pigs were have allergy problems but after about a week of having this in my room the guinea pigs cage is in myroom their allergies cleared up and saved me from a huge pricey vet bill ill be buying another soon for my cat room
the brand seems to have changed names twice since ive been using it and the new packaging is the same bottle they have always used but now it is also placed in a sealed heavy plastic bagvery very wasteful and such a poor use of plastic for a company putting out organic items especially they already had a seal on the bottle and the cap is wrapped in a plastic band so the bag is truly wasteful also i believe the mg in each bottle has changed at least twicei believe 3 timesjust seems sketchy since it was not advertised to have changed i only knew by reading the package  that said it seems to work perfectly well i just may start looking for another brand that gives me more confidence and less waste
saw this on insta and immediately bought thru amazon primebetter  but it is terrible  poor qualitypoor instructions and flimsy cord for charging it took forever to heat up and i was terrified that it would tangle my hair i didnt have to worry because it would not wind fullyi returned and treated myself to a curling ironsometimes old school is still the best
excellent product for hair that wont lie flat  ive been using tancho tique for more than 50 years
this pill box is pretty big but it has to be to hold 31 days of medication  the daily  pill containers are not huge but the individual compartments will hold the six pills i take once a day and few pills two more times a day  the pill splitter is a nice addition also  my wife is traveling for a month and she was worried i wouldnt take the right medicine while she was gone  now she can fill this pill box up for a month  its just he right pill box for my situation  glad i found it on amazon i was going to buy several small pill boxes  the quality is good enough and should last a few years
got this for photo and video shoots where 34wardrobe malfunctions34 cant happen without requiring reshooting  the only thing that will hold outfits in place tighter and not take skin off is doublesided wig tape but it is tough to conceal the tape outline if the fabric is thin  this is in the middle of the spectrum between heavy duty 34stickum34 sprays and the wig tapefour stars instead of 5 because the applicator tip is less than ideal  this product used to come packaged like a 34glue stick34 which seemed to be less messy than the applicator tip that come on this one
seems good quality
comfortable and absorbent
strong motor easy to use
perfect very nice exactly what i expected great price
i have been taking 10000 mcg biotin supplements daily for many years to help with hair and nail health this vita mountain product has calcium in it as well and i am not sure why they added that ingredient as far as quality i have no reason to score this less than five stars for actual purchasing i would go with whatever is cheapest which is often natrol or nutricost i am unaware of any notable differences between the brands
this is useful and seems durable its replacing a similar cane i bought a year ago which bent but that was a different design for the leg and seemed less durable i hope this one will last i use a different cane in the summer but find it useful to have a light on the cane in the winter when i have to see ice and snow to walk the flashing red light is very useful for crossing the street at night the alarm might not seem like a great idea but lets be honest there are people who attack cripples and i ended up needing the alarm only 2 days after i got the cane when i was randomly attacked near my homei get a lot of compliments on it from people who are impressed with the idea of a cane with lights built in
this is one of the best cheap beauty tool that is on the market right now it is very affordable and within the budget it is a no frills device just place it in the refrigirator and it actually works it is alao portable and can be brought during travel what i love about this is that it also has a container which protects it from bacteria while in the ref it is very helpful in giving relief against sinus pressure also it instantly lifts and freshens up a tired face the only reason why i didnt give 5 stars is that i find it cost more than similar products in the market now recommending it though
very sturdy great price everyone at the wedding was jealous as they were all sinking in the mud
good quality sweet almond
in my house we have a sock monster who eats only one sock of every pair  then there is the mess monster  he leaves a mess that no one knows anything about  we also have another monster which has been frustrating me  the dustpan monster  this monster not only makes dustpans disappear for months at a time but when they come back they have bites out of them or corners missing  when i saw this i was ecstatic  lets take a lookwhat is this set likethis set comes in a box of parts  you have to put them together but the instructions are easy to follow and loaded with pictures for those who are visual learners  once the set is assembled you end up with a broom and a dustpan that clip together when not in usehow does this performi have to say many brooms have left me wanting more  this one however works just right  it is not the best broom i have ever used but it is definitely way better than many of them  the cleaning feature of the dustpan is fantastic  it really worksdoes the dustpan leave dirt on the floorif i press down the dustpan lightly i find that 95 of the dirt goes in the first time  i might have to press down with my foot for very fine dirt but for the most part it works welldoes the dustpan lockthe dustpan locks into place but it also is not hard to press down to use either  there is no release button it is pressure activatedis there a hole to hang this fromno there is not a hole to hang this from  you will have to use a clip broom hanger style to put this on the walldoes this stand upwhen this is put together and the dustpan is up the counterbalance of the broom causes this to stand up pretty wellthe bottom linei am very happy to have this set  i love the dustpan which seems to work quite well and also has the great cleaning feature for the broom bristles  it definitely does clean off pet fur and dustmy ratingfive stars  i love this set  i have looked for a long time for a set like this but the best part is that it stores well and stands up nicely too it is compact
bought this as an alternative to fresh wild blueberries to add to the medical mediums heavy metal detox smoothie
oh my gosh i love my foam roller i thought it might be too hard  dense at first but after a week of using it my body adjusted and my softer foam roller just isnt enough on most areas anymore im a massage therapist and i get tight everywhere i  use this to roll out my entire back neck upper arms forearms glutes legs  feet balancing on the roller  stretching that fascia on the bottom of the feet is great for plantar fasciitis i like to use it after a hot shower or hot tub soak so i am loosened up a bit it is so efficient that im able to spend less time on self carestretching than i used to hallelujah with the accompaniment of a couple tennis balls to get into the small spots thats all i need i use the smallest 12 size so i can transport it around with me to different offices but i finally just got a 2nd one so i can always have one at my main office as well as home when i realized how dependent i am on my foam roller i thought i really ought to write a review ive also seen reviews of other brands saying they fell apart and this one is super sturdy  ive been using it at least once a day for roughly 6 months and it looks and feels exactly the same as the brand new one that i just received i have a feeling it will probably last forever like really forever to the detriment of the environment uh anyway great product
love this pocket guide great information
my doctor says same deteriorates rapidly from humidity  he says must buy the kind in individual foil protection  too bad cause these are cheaper but this form too fragile he says
good to have for large bandage backups
great price  perfect for upcoming hiking trip
i was apprehensive to order any compression stockings online but i did order these and i am so glad i did the quality is great and they fit as expected wash well i just let them air dry if you are looking for a less expensive compression stocking you should buy these beats paying 10000 plus at the doctors office

i trust garden of life products i love this one because their products are plant based
i like form  of these where i dont have to store big plastic bottle of detergent  they are easy enough to usefor normal dirty clothese these work fine  the scent is not too strong at least for my taste and my husbandshowever he worked in the yard putting up decorations and his clothes were a mix of sweat dirt and i dont even know what  i did use double dose and not all the dirt came out  most of it did but there were still a few spots where i can see dirt spots  my husband said its ok becasue they are his work clothes but for me i need my clothes clean really clean  the sweat smell came out nicely but i dont think this is strong enough for really tough deep dirty clothes we started using different things around the house to be eco friendly and this is a really nice way to add to that  i did have to wash a few things again and i did use my normal detergent and it came out fine
i love how many different sounds and intensities there arei personally love the rain  i just love the sound of rain  its soothing and really helps me relax to fall asleepso easy to use  i do like that it charges up using a usb cableon the nights when its just too chilly to turn on my fan i like that i can still have the sound of a fan running without the cold air blowinga great sound machine that can be used by anyone in the family
these are so pretty and exactly what i wanted
a bit more  than the average pill holder but it is worth it very sturdy clips on each compartment that should travel well easy to open nice spring action too a unique front facing design so you dont have to turn it around for night and day pills
wow you get 30 rolls of the best toilet paper i have found and a box of sturdy 30 gallon trash bags it doesnt get any better than that

this is a tasty vitamin drink with trace minerals ive been using it for 2 months and havent noticed anything amazing but i do feel good about getting my nutrients what i dont feel good about is every time i look it up to buy another canister the price is higher i wont be buying more until the price gets back to just over reasonable as the first 2 were to me 43 and 44 are a bit high but my friend wanted me to try it now its 6150 just 3 weeks later up 30 no im not going for it

i bought this for my son who is on the autism spectrum  i was concerned that he wasnt getting is teeth completely clean everywhere  unfortunately  this doesnt really work  it barely moves and feels awkward  i feel like it was a huge waste of money
easy to apply after bathing without spilling  this is nice product without being too greasy  fine mist will do the trick without pouring it in your hand and possibility of spilling
i cant notice any difference at all except for the strong odor it leaves my shower has white tile that turns a little yellow if not cleaned this product does no difference at all except on the yellow stuff the only difference it will make to your life is the waste of money and the waste of time spraying after each time you take a shower
as school starts and cold season approaches its time for immunity building my spouse served me the drink and i asked if they added seltzer because it was so effervescent which i like but it was just from the tablet dissolving in water my kids begged to taste it because it looks like lemonade and they really liked the flavor i was surprised it didnt taste too bad to me either slightly lemony with three kids in school heres hoping for less sickness this season
great scale arrive in perfect condition
not very sticky they kept falling off sent them back
pay close attention all of the reviews for this product are for hair conditioner or hair products
when i first opened the container of gummies i was expecting to smell something light and citrusy instead i was met with a very strong odor that smells like a combination of plastic and cleaning supplies its quite strong despite the rather scary aroma i tried one anyway and they are quite delicious im just a bit put off by the smell
i love to take a nice weekend nap but our house gets a surprising amount of sunlight also when taking a day nap my eyelashes end up all squashed and wonky with no time to try and tame them back to unsmooshed length and curlthese silk sleep masks solve both of those major nap issues they keep the light out while being oh so comfortable to wear i dont notice them they are light not too tight and dont shift the silk also keeps my lashes from squishing they just glide over the silkso comfortable so nice looking and feeling i feel like a 50s screen star im just a glamorous napper
the first bag i ordered was bright orange and felt and worked great as a natural vitamin c the second and third bag i ordered were brown in color with a very different taste and smell not consistent and really disappointed in the quality control also the color of powder does not match color in product imagebut i love terrasoul products so i will buy their camu camu powder nstead which is supposed to have 3x more vitamin c then acerola cherry
i have very small eyes so i havent been able to find an eyelash curler that works for me i had very high hopes for this product but it doesnt curl my lashes at all and the first time i used it i used it too long and my eyes puffed up from the heat i guess i actually burned my eye lid it also says to use after applying mascara in the directions but when i tried this my mascara came off like i said i really wanted this product to work for me but it just didnt
unfortunately these didnt work and i returned them first if you have a larger roll of paper theyre not large enough to fit around the rollsecond the cutter wrinkles and tears the paper instead of delivering a clean cut
all of dr axe products are reliable  these work  period
the gloves are soft wash up nicely serve the purpose of hand lotion treatment at night very well they come in small boxes making it easy to pack and take with thanks
been using this since our baby was a newborn although i know this company was under some scrutiny a while ago i still think this is a great product we havent really had much diaper rashes but when we did this took care of it its a thicker consistently when the tube is new but over time it can become more liquidy especially in warmer temperatures and it turns to like an oil so best to keep in a cooler place also sometimes when the tube gets really old and low there are some grainy things im not sure if thats because the product has dried out a bit overall i think this is a good diaper rash ointment or preventative ointment it also goes on clear so you babys butt isnt covered in like white
great product it is sturdy and just high enough for me i love the handle as i have poor balance the person that said to step on it before you depend on the handle is correct i am happy i bought this
really cool product no complaints i love the style too
great product speedy delivery would rest again
use this for nail art
this is such a great scale it is very light weight and the numbers are easy to read
i tried first day super cute and really comfortable
i use this product for keeps drain traps filled in the science lab the extra heavy formula helps it stay in place and fill the large space in the pipe
good quality hair support
this product is amazing we moved into a home that has some funky smells going on in it i opened this up in the bedroom and since then i havent smelled anything bad on my whole upper floor every now and again i catch a clean scent but for the most part it just smells like nothing the absence of an odor which is just what i was hoping for
nice unit  except the bracket is too narrow to hold waterpic and similar showerheads which renders it useless for metoo bad really that the distributor and manufacturer dont take the time to let potential purchasers know this because they refuse to take returns on this itemtoo bad really because the unit is otherwise acceptable the suction cup adheres well and the bracket allows a fair range of adjustment gfor the showerhead  if you have one that fits the bracketjerry
i am very happy with this supplement i have purchased from this company before and have never had issues magnesium is great to help with muscle soreness

seems silly to write a review for a sleep mask but this one is worth it  and i feel obligated to share it with ya all who are shopping for one  i have been a sleepmask addict for 10 years thats what having a child can do to you evidently i literally cannot fall asleep without one this 34earth therapeutics34 is the one and only for me but i have 5 of them ha ha sleep masks are either too slippery dont stay on too transparent not enough coverage too uncomfortablethick too much coverage or too small or too big or not adjustable around my head to fit right its neat that it has a soft side i love during cooler weather and a satin side great for warmer weather its the perfect size  not too little but not too big i dont like to notice the sleep mask it has to feel natural i tried the memoryfoam type ones and ones that seem sort of molded for 34comfort34 and they were awful whats more  they last they last through washes the velcro and elastic are not 34cheap34 they are strong and stay solid i have had the same mask my first one a pink one which was a gift for over 5 years and its still going strong i have 5 of them just to rotate and keep them washed to keep my skin clean at night i cant even recommend a runnerup  this is the endall beallps if you try the masks with the headphones so you can listen to tunes as you fall asleep i just want to say how disappointed i was i couldnt find a good comfortable mask with builtin headphones so when i want music at night i just use headphones separately let me know if you find a great earth therapeutics lightweight sleep mask with built in headphones that dont add bulk and annoyance ha ha
it works
these are very poorly made and thin material would not stay up and do nothing to help with knee pain
normally i just love gummy vitamins but these dont taste very good  i like the vitamins and omega3s they contain all that is very good  they just dont taste good  i immediately get a fishy flavor got to be from the algae they are made from followed by some serious tartness  though they are still palatable why consume these when there are other gummy vitamins that are just as good and taste a lot better  if you dont mind tartness and a little fishy flavor then i highly recommend these
looks like this hibiscus powder is new on the market and i decided to give it a try it shipped quickly and was packaged well i found it to be of a very good quality it has a nice intense color and smells like freshly ground this is a true superfood with tons of good benefits it works great on my hair and i also like adding it to my morning smoothies and teas definitely i would recommend it

useless as a smoothing brush on curly hair or regular hair tried it on childs long hair it just got tangled in it tried it on my average hair and it did nothing

i feel that taking these towards evening helps me to sleep better it takes the edge off some of those racing thoughts that happened to many of us at night along with melatonin this product is helping get some zs
repeat buy helps me keep up immunity working in healthcare
very cheap does not give correct weight total waist of money
this is better than nothing i have a garden tub with nonslip bottom no one would be able to sit in a tub with a nonslip surface it doesnt stick too well on the fiberglass but i can deal with that overall it makes the tub very inviting and serves my purpose
this is a great product i have tried several different straightening devices to straighten my beard this one is the best one definitely worth the money it heats up quickly and if you forget to turn it off they even have a automatic shutoff
had to throw them away because they smelled like smoke so bad the box was yellow but unopened
pretty nice device and my face felt relaxed after the massage took me a minute to figure out of to use this device but after the learning phase went into action got my face muscle to relax and did a bit in the neck also take a while to get used to this device but is worth it good quality and came in a nice box
i  tried to remove the balls off of a sweater and a tshirt it damaged the sweater so bad i had to buy my son a new one its like running piece of metal with jagged teeth on your clothes
this shiatsu neck and back massager has 4 massage nods help get a nice deep muscle massage and an added heat option to help blood circulation  it has a car charger that allows you to operate it in your car and a strap to secure it  this comes with a massager pillow power cord car adapter and  easy to understand directionsi have a lot of back and neck pain and boy does this help it  it just massaged the tightness and pain from them  it has strong powerful rollers and a one minute timer which switches directions of the rollers after a minutethis is not cordless you must be near an outlet to use thisi received this neck and back massager to use review and to give my honest opinion about it
in short open reservoir cup makes it easy to add water keep clean and to allow dry between uses can adjust strength slim design makes it easy to maneuver around mouth takes up little room can be packed up for on the go use loud but similar to my corded tank stylei use water flossers all the time the best to me is a particular name brand that has a tank and is plugged in i keep that in my main bathroom that has a plug nearby since i rely greatly on water flossing i wanted to have one in my 1st floor bathroom which is like the size of a closet and has no counter and no plugs so i have been tried cordless flossers for use in that bathroomhere is the thing i find with most of them the water reservoirs are bulky and are hard to clean i dont care that they dont hold much water that is easy enough to deal with but to have an enclosed cup that really can ever be cleaned out gross then i tried one where there  and that works really well for my needs that one wins out over this due to one aspect it is fully cordless when i saw this hangsun water flosser i decided to try itit has appearance of regular plug in but an open water top that makes me feel better about it drying between uses i didnt need another flosser but i wanted to find out more about it and report back in a reviewso this may be for you if you are like me in wanting a cordless flosser with an open water reservoir i can easily add more water to it it is easy to clean and it dries between uses charge has been long lasting so i like that i dont need to fuss it is nice for use in noplug areas while cordless i still feel attached as i need to set the base down doubt i would use this in shower with my other one i may need to supply my own cup for water but it can be any size and i can use it in shower just by cupping my handkinda loud similar to my plug in name brand onei tend to only ever use one head the slightly curved one havent tried the other options and likely wontof the half dozen cordless flossers i have tried including a name brand cordless i like this one and the one i linked to the best i use them secondary to my plug in
im a big fan of mint and a big fan of chocolate  many see girl scout thin mints as the apex of chocolatemint cookiedom but i was looking for something more  i think ive found it in these york peppermint pattie cookies  the cookies consist of a chocolate cookie covered with mint creme and dipped in chocolate  heres whats so great about them  first these cookies are dipped in dark chocolate which i personally prefer to milk chocolate  second they have a nice layer of mint creme which gives a nice texture compliment to the crunchy cookie  third the mint creme is a true strong peppermint great for those who love their mint  overall this is a great cookie  id happily munch one anytime
i am a size 12 and it barely fit

i used to love this alpiste milk but for some reason they added guar gum and now its too thick i liked the previous one it was a much lighter version so much better i hope they can bring it backfor those who do enjoy thicker milks this is great for liver cleanse loosing and keeping extra weight off
im so glad i got these they last just as long as the original battery and its invaluable to have extra batteries when youre places without electricity such as camping trips if you have the camera its worth the few bucks to get the extra batteries i got an exceptional price
received the device a couple of days ago  stumbled around a little bit to get the hang of it but its easy when you know what you are doing  purchased this one because of the many positive reviews  good choice  im just wearing it now to see how i do normally  i cant believe i am such a low stepper  no wonder ive seen a weight gain  darn the reality of sitting at a computer all day  when you can 34see34 for yourself what you are doing or more importantly not doing it really is a motivator  grandma was slow but she was old  i hope to reverse some of that old saying
i got this free at cvs using extra bucks but that price still seems too high mine had no mechanical problems and the vibrations were pretty strong it shook the entire table which makes me wonder if it should be containing that vibration and channeling it into the jewelry more efficiently its important to note that the cvs price was only 799 and i got it half off after christmas for basically four bucks i tried it first with just warm water no change my jewelry still had some grime then tried with a drop of dawn same result the photo in my review is after two cycles the debris in the lid is from dropping it while trying to open it that wasnt actually removed by the device i also experienced difficulty removing the lid but i was able to get it apart with just my hands save your money dont get it
i cannot tell if its picking up anything dirt is still there after spraying and wiping it smells great though
prosecure fitcomfortable to wear4 layersconscannot think of any 
i was hoping this was the original formula but it is not i used this detergent with my last 2 kids so i know the smell of it and this one is not the same i loved the old smell which last longer on the clothes after washing this one fades away i can barely smell it after the clothes come out of the washer also the original formula is much more concentrated therefore you only need to use a little bit i used more with this one as for packaging it arrived well packaged in plastic so there was no leak
works exactly as advertised zero smoke  not sure how long it lasts but out of the package id call it a miracle product  surprise bonus was the smoke buddy keychain great entertainment posing him after using the smoke buddy
when i decided to order them i must have misread the directions  once i received them i discovered that the daily amount is three  that  means a package is a twenty day supply  to me that is too expensive and the taste really isnt that great  i didnt take them long enough to determine how helpful they will be
wow these are amazing
i bought this as a replacement to my original strap and it works great
works well in dishwasher and leaves dishes and glassware clean and sparkly have used this product for years
i purchased this scale on april 10 2016 today is may 16 2017 and my scale no longer works i changed the batteries when they died and now when you stand on the scale it says scanning step off thinking and then err like many others i reset the scale reset it up left batteries out etc i sought out the help page on fitbit 5 pages of people with the same problem no response from fitbit i am very angry that my 13 month old 123 scale no longer works i just bought a 17 digital scale to replace this bad show fitbit6117 update fitbit reached out to me and sent me a replacement scale no charge after we tried a few things to reboot my original scale their customer service has been fantastic and was wonderful to work with i really appreciate the good faith and of course the new scale i will gladly purchase their products again
i received this set undamaged and in good working order i tried the different heads included and have to say that it definitely works as intended you are using electricity so please follow all safety guidelines and do not use it for things it was not intended much like a tens unit this unit sends current into the skin at its lowest settings you merely feel a slight pleasant vibration i lack the courage to try it at its highest setting because it would surely give a pretty significant jolt in between those extremes there are several settings that create a good working base for a variety of uses for instance it gives instructions on aging or delicate skin when applying serums and when trying to alleviate painthe booklet is pretty clear on its warnings suggestions and instructions the box it came in has a magnetic closure dense foam to cradle the different fragile glass heads and the unit itself it will take some experimentation with to find the optimum level of comfort and efficacy
butter no pecan blcch
its not bad i havent felt any results as others have so i am going on faith that it will deliver benefits over time you must mix it with berries or something the taste by itself is a little rustic for me i make it as a keto smoothie with some heavy whipping cream fruit water a touch of stevia doable
its much thinner than i was hoping for but should do the trick if i double or triple layer it  but that will only make the usable length 13 what is listed
just as shown and just as stated the suction cups could be better but the price was right
i like how this makes me feel  great stuff
was having good success with bulletproof stress gummies but they contained malitol so i started looking for a viable substitute  this brand seemed pretty close  same sensoril ashwagandha just more same ltheanine a little more b6 plus the addition of gaba and magnesiumi find this blend helps with anxiety that started for me with perimenopause  the kind of irrational anxiety that you know is just anxiety  the sudden dwelling on all things bad  stressful the sense of impending doom  this blend helps a lot with that  i also find it useful as my brains leans toward overstimulation  i probably would have been labeled autistic as a 70s child had it been a thing  my brain does not shift gears well  it is not good at surprises  although i cope and try to be rational when hubs asks me to do something suddenly my brain just wont let me sometimes  i call it my gears jamming  this supplement helps that  it backs my brain down of the ledge and makes me think reasonably againoverall  super pleased with these  they are just what i was looking for
this is really great stuff  it is natural  it works  i learned about it years ago when i was going to fly  now i fly more often and am in a car traveling on all kinds of roads and in mountains at times and it is just really wonderful to help keep motion sickness away  it even works on ships as well  his is really a wonderful find  it is simple nothing i have to wear like a wrist thing not a pill where i could have side effects just simply an oil i put behind my ears  i make sure i am always stocked up on this wonderful stuff  i suggest it to anyone who may have a need
you cant expect quality products if its super cheap especially organic acerola i take the acerola tabs but sometimes i rather just mix it in my drinks this is very tart so i recommend mixing it with juice and also using a whisk it can clump very easily it really does give me energy im very sensitive to caffeine so this is a great alternative to energy drinks doesnt mess with my glucose levels and i dont crash on this the benefits of acerola are amazing and i recall hardly getting sick living in puerto rico because we had a large acerola tree in our back yard my mom use to juice them and we ate them as a family on a daily basis miss that tree
my son has chafing issues and this fixed his problem desitin is very messy but this stuff dries and helps the skin glide when rubbing together he hasnt had pain ever since i bought this
this review is more to clarify someone elses review bc they didnt understand understand the labeling  it shows 1000mg as advertised  another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium  i realize not everyone takes chemistry but 4 ppl liked his review  so misinformation is spreading  this works if however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr  ask for a medication called linzess which works must better  must faster but is unnecessary for most people  if magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food  drink 68 glasses of water per day  staying hydrated will really help  before switching to linzess i used to take one 1000 mg pill am  pm every day with meals  always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid
i really like these they are similar to other brands but cheaper and i feel like they work better than other brandsthey are somewhat hard to remove but thats with any brand i did notice a whiter smile
these work okay i used them twice and they are a bit awkward at first but you have to wear a long sleeve tee or other type of sweater otherwise they are noticeable take a little while to get used to but after a few minutes they prove to be comfortable
awesome heavy very good quality its so nice to have something to use for all my oils should probably get another one soon
love this mask  fits well without any gaps
i was nervous ordering these but they came perfect for my items i sell the color is accurate and bags are not to thin great for lip gloss
very uncomfortable
these little brooms are awesome work better than any ive ever purchased the price is also great as you get two sets i love mine
remote control worked great
not recommended
i had a brick hearth under an old wood burner removed the wood burner and installed a propane stove several bricks and the mortar in some areas were a mess i liked the old brick but had to do a bunch of repairs then grind off the excess mortar and some high spots in the brick the result was some brick looked brand new some mortar was pale and newly ground down the whole thing looked really rough i used less than 13 of the bottle applied with a cheap paint brush it now looks like the whole thing was nicely done 25 or more years ago i cant believe how well this stuff works the real test of its look is momma loves it
i use files to file my 4 month olds nails instead of clipping them and i absolutely love glass files the best they stand up to the test of time and are so nice and solid very thankful to have found these

i mixed a heaping scoopful in some cold filtered water and it took some stirring but finally seemed to dissolve  it turned the water a beautiful cherry red but it did not taste like cherries  it tastes a lot like beets since beets are the primary ingredient and i could detect the flavor of the soil they were grown in  ive grown organic beets in my raised beds and i never could get the dirt taste completely out of them so im not complaining  as far as sweetness goes there was very little despite it being sweetened with stevia  i will be putting this into my smoothies and kefir smoothies from now on since its flavor is not all that good but the ingredients are top notch
loved this pattern  washed and used it and no issues worked as intended
these work great for me i have tried so many i wont buy anything else ever again
this is significantly better than any recorded white noise that ive ever found  this product actually pushes air instead of just playing a recorded noise and it works perfectly for someone who needs noise to studyworksleepetcif you are looking for your sound machine to multitask ie also be an alarm clock this is not for you but i would purchase this and an additional alarm clock because its that good
great scent you only need 12 drops of oil for a strong scent 
i really loved this product by far the best one ive owned it looked great with my mascara i could not be happier with it
i find my focus increased and my energy way up when i take 2 capsules i appreciate that the ingredients are listed with amounts rather than a proprietary blend of ingredientsim a huge fan i also noticed my appetite greatly reduced
it helps take some pressure off my backthe only reason why i have 3 stars is because i cant sit with this belt for more than 15 or it starts to give me cramps and allot of pressure on my stomach so everytime you sit down you have to take it off thats the only bad thing
these really arent too shabby the cleaning sheets are as expectedi read through the product description before ordering  i think i have used something similar in the past as it felt rather intuitive to use just add a sheet to water it instantly dissolves i think 1 sheet per gallon give or take can be stuffed into a cleaning bottle for a spray solution or can be added to a bucket smells nice works well small pressure zip plastic packaging little footprint really no wastei have used it primarily on counter tops and tubs while it mentions floors and walls i just use it as a basic cleanerseems gentle enough my rag picks up a lot of dirt so i know it is effective current price of 5 for 30 sheets makes this a budget friendly option especially if looking for something that doesnt take up much space or plan to use it in a spray bottle of course there are liquid concentrates that would offer same but hey i thought it worth pointing outi really think it is an ok productlack of directions is a concern though i dont mind information in another language other than english if i cant figure it out then using a translator app i pass my phone over it  odd thing is there arent any instructions the most info you get on this product is what you see here on the product page there is no workable information printed on the package so i dont down rate because of the info not being in english i down rate because there simply is no info i will include a picture of the translated text but even so i think nearly anyone couldshould be able to figure this product outwatersoluble cleaning sheet concentrated cleaning sheet will quickly dissolves upon contact with water and is immediately ready for your cleanup jobi do  like these cleaning sheets i clean homes for a living and while i dont always need my own cleaners i do keep a few in my tool kit having the option of mixing something up on the go and having no added weight or mess to carry around is highly appealing  i would even tear off half a sheet and add it directly to a toilet it does dissolve instantly easily and smells good and fresh not too strong no need to rinselovely product overall 4 stars
bought as a gift for my husband he loves them
my elderly disabled mother 5 225 lbs  has no issues using this  it is sturdy and very helpful for her getting in and out of her bed
this is a nice ice roller it rollsspins without effort and doesnt stick even when very cold compared to another i have this handle is easier to hold as its made for a normal grip i have another one where the handle is somewhat triangle shaped the freezer case is especially nice as you can store it without worry of food contact it doesnt take up much room in the freezer i recommend this model
got this for my husband so he can have his meds really for the month and he likes this makes it so much nicer than doing them by the week  hes happy  and it works so well and with the little compartments being able to come out to take your pills that is nice as well  you dont have to mess with trying to get your pills out by holding the whole thing
i purchased this for my husband as he was looking to try a new creatine hes been taking it daily and has so far seen some pretty decent results the taste is good dissolves fairly well in water which often times is a challenge with creatine in general overall its a little early to really tell how well this is working out but it seems to be just fine ill update the review with more info once more time has passed from taking it
i have ibs it sucks being regular is apparently more important that i thought it would be wtf right anyway i take fiber gummies because of this theyre yummy dont leave them in the sun though its gummy it will melt
bought for older relative who was having issues with mouth sores
works like its supposed to
i love them nicer than the black ones  been using them for more then 3 years
this sleep mask is one of the most adorable ones ive ever seen it has a 3d effect because the floppy ears are attached separately to the mask and jut out its really cute and would be appreciated by dog lovers as well as fans of the disney movie the price is a little high for this type of thing but otherwise its a fun sleep mask especially for children now if only they made a cat version based on the aristocats
we wanted a first aid bag that we could fill for our dog its roomy and just what we needed
this freshcap unwind instant drink mix tastes very good  its slightly sweet and no where near being too sweet  some people may want to add a little more sweetener to it  i mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it completely dissolved leaving no mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup  it nearly has the color of coffee and when i added a little cream to it it looked exactly like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but without the caffeine  the product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix i guess that means reishi and chaga but it doesnt say per serving  nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving  im assuming that you get 1000 mg of reishi and chaga per tube  i looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules i have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so i guess one tube also contains 1000 mg  overall i think this is a good product especially useful right before bedtime to promote a better nights sleep and it tastes good too
i do not often eat nutrition bars but when i need to these are the ones i select  they are not too sweet chock full of good little crunchy things and priced well  i cannot find them in retail stores even tho i shop at organic groceries and wonder why they are not more widely available
my french class was reading a few of the childrens stories upon which this film is based  after watching the film the consensus was this is a good film if not great  might be better suited for an audience of children than adults  that is probably for whom it was intended
but i dont get a lot of support from it for your knee you need more support than what this brace offers the side supports are not metal they are a plastic and bend easily enough i dont fight the fit to be very good and am disappointed in this knee brace
i have used sea moss gummies before  but i must admit that i was a little scared to try the real thing  since i like to keep my diet in the raw as much as possible  i decided to give this a shot  honestly  its basically tasteless  it has a very faint oceany flavor that i barely notice  if i put it in a smoothie  i dont notice it at all  the texture reminds me of chia seed jam  it works really well as a thickener in smoothie bowls and pudding if you are gluten free  its a good way to thicken soups as well  the serving size is very low so this bag should last a long time
i had given her mom one previously but she said she had never seen it because mommy keeps everything for herself that is a 12 year olds opinion so i got her this one and if she cant get those blackheads our of her face with the machine then she use the tools that are included
always use them extra soft
i found that this traction device is of the utmost highest quality than all the rest also if you have any questions you can contact the company and they will assist you  my surgery liked it so good the he was going to recommend it to his other patients  it is easy to adjust up and down and very comfortable as much as traction can be i have tried several others and this is by far the best for a soft traction device
i used it maybe 10 times and it stopped working i used a small torx screwdriver and took the screw out of the bottom and used a small flat screw driver to put in the slot to slide the cutter head off of the plastic base i took my old razor head tabs broke off like everyone elses and compared and they are very similar but whatever grease they are using fails pretty quickly and becomes sticky causing the hair to get stuck i suppose you could clean their grease off and use a white lithium grease or something and it would work fine but i just decided to swap my old oem cutter head into the new plastic base works great now
45these zep cleaners that came in the zep cleaning bundle work perfectly just like brand names if not better than somethis bundle comes with an all purpose cleaner and a streak free glass cleaner the all purpose cleaner is a degreaser as well and it works brilliantly we had grease splatter on the stove top and i was dreading the clean up but figured it would be a great test for this stuff i gave it a spray let it sit for 60 seconds attempted a wipe up and wow the grease came right up i was impressed i wasnt 100 in love with the smell but the cleaning power sold methe glass cleaner i would definitely say is in line with other blue glass cleaners it only streaked if i wiped it really poorly i can streak any windowmirrorglass surface imaginable i am so bad at that it had the normal smell that you would expect i liked it a loti thought both these cleaners were very good im not sure about the price and how it compares to other cleaners though even though i definitely recommend these for their cleaning power i did have to take just a tad off for the slightly higher cost
i ordered this because i have a hip replacement coming up and after checking out the walkers medicare would provide for me decided this is a much better option while ive only tried it out so far i am pleased with its appearance and solidity it is very sturdy and with the back wheels being further apart than are the front wheels there is more room for me another feature that i really like is that i can pull up on the strap in the middle of the seat and fit it through a narrow bathroom door while still using it for support while this is a heavy nylon seatand not paddedit and the back fit me well and provide solid lumbar support someone else looked at it today and was quite impressed she said they paid over 500 for a walker for her brother that was flimsy with metal that quickly bent so that the thing was useless she plans to get one of these for her mother the only downside seems to be that the included cupholder cant be put on without loosening a strangelooking screwwe have to find a screwdriver that will fit it a cane holder is also included the velcroattached bag is good sized if you want to go to the hassle of removing 8 screwgizmos with large plastic heads they are easy to do and lower the arms it will fit in the included bag
perfect we need this because the toilet is very low good product
this is the 56th bp monitor that i have tried and ordered through amazon either via purchase or the vine program and is a basic monitor almost every single monitor takes my bp within a few points of each other and this ones accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors this one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user note that i did not take 180 readings so this is unverified after the reading it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse it averages the bp after three successful bp readings but the average recall is not marked as an average most monitors identify an average with the avg notation it has an irregular heartbeat indicator  there is one large cuff provided that will fit most people there are two power options available and included and that is four aaa batteries or via a usb type c cable time settings are in the 24hour clock military time only voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy chinese accentincluded in the package one bp unit one bp user manual and one digital pamphlet one large cuff one cloth carry pouch one usb type c cable and 4 aaa batteriesfeatures up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory date and time settings are available in 24hour clock only setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual the lcd display readout is large for easy reading the cuff is 22 to 42 cm 866 to 16535 inches which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese clearing all the bp settings is just a matter of holding the mem button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until all ee appears the display is large accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors press and hold the set button when power is off wait until the user indicator blinks and then press mem to switch to the other user it displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such it has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female chinese accentnegatives the cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance the average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the avg indicator what happens is that after three readings the first number displayed is the average the next three numbers and beyond are the readings once i cycle through all the readings the average is never displayed again unless i turn off the unit and then press the memory button again the voice option is moderated by a heavy female chinese accentthis is an acceptable bp monitor operation and setup of this unit is simple once i read the manual to take my blood pressure i affixed the cuff around my left arm with my palm turned up i made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor then i pressed start and after a little bit i had my reading i pressed stop to turn off the unit the systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayedblood pressure is never the same from moment to moment so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes it is important for a user to learn how to take their bp to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when in fact it is user error there are many great videos online that can help teach thisin summary this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual the cuff is large enough for most people and the lcd display is large and easy to read it displays an avg after three readings but that is not marked the voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented the current price is not listed but any price at 24 or below would be reasonable for thisfor those who are interested i attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5star monitors these monitors i consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others i tested i listed two 4star monitors because they have unique features such as spanish speaking or bluetooth each one of these monitors is accurate and i would highly recommend any of them  this is known as the gold standard of bp monitors it stores 100 readings between 2 users it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an ac adapter can be purchased separately the arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people   this is the monitor i use most often in the winter so i do not have to disrobe to expose my arm it stores 120 readings between 2 users it is great for portability comes with a hard case and is battery operated in addition it has cp g correct position guidance to ensure the user does not make an error that only works if it is turned on accuracy is spot on which is atypical of wrist monitors   this is great if a talking monitor in both english and spanish is needed it stores 120 readings between 2 users in addition to battery operation it comes with an ac adapter two very flimsy cuffs and a case if the cuffs were better this would be my favorite arm monitor  this is a great monitor with a large cuff two power sources 4 aaa batteries or ac cable and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each 45 stars  this monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes the lcd display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green yellow and red based on the hypertension levelwhich is excellent there are two power options it takes four aaa batteries or a usb type c cable both are included there is an average feature after two readings there are date or time settings in ampm not military time the cuff size is large there is an irregular heartbeat indicator accuracy is spot on   this is one unique monitor the monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the ios or android app vihealth the cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small operation is simple this is rechargeable and comes with the usb type c cable for charging there is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app there is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app in fact the readings can be associated with multiple users number and amount unknown the date and time are automated through the bluetooth pairing with the app as of june 2022 the app is quirky and does not always connect the bp unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone the  is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulationtens option both are 4 stars  this monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes the lcd display is large and easy to read there are two power options of either four aa batteries not included or a microusb cable included there is an average feature after two readings there are date or time settings in 24hour clock military time only the cuff size is large and will fit most users there is also voice broadcast mode and two alarm options this does not have an irregular heartbeat indicator  45 stars
did not work  i returned this item
i had high hopes for this as i suffer from neck pain that radiates up into my head at times may be stress maybe misalignment not sure but it didnt help me with my problem its possible it needs to be used for a longer period of time to get any results but its very uncomfortable and a few times i felt  like it almost made it worse maybe it was just not  a good match for my problem but for my personal experience i cannot say it helped
this is a good kit that has the heavy duty metal rasp and the finer sandpaper type on the 2 sided tool  my husbands feet get cracked on heelscalluses during winter and mine more so in summer from wearing sandalsthis is the perfect thing for using in the shower or just sitting down and taking care of yr feet  the nail brush also included is used almost every day and really is handy to have
if i could give this 10 stars i would this is the second product i purchased to clean our napoleon wood burning fireplace glass doors the first product required harsh scrubbing and many reapplications to get the soot off with this product the soot practically falls off no scrubbing absolutely effortless amazing product
just received this and so far love it it had a charge but i charged it overnight in my phone charger and used every accessory the next day it still had plenty of power left 1520min of playing around with it no pain with any and the facial hair remover worked great no redness or hair seen 2 days later im 53 dark haired with light complexion the nose trimmer piece came apart when i went to put it on and it was tricky putting it back together but i eventually got it not my favorite to use but it works not sure about the eyebrow trimmer but i didnt buy it for that i didnt try the body shaver as i had shaved my legs  underarms that day so far i am very happy with this purchase and feel its a great buy overall would definitely recommend
a great collection of ingredients in one mix  im a 330 lb male and 1 dose gives me a good nonjittery energy boost and even if im hungry i wont want to eat_ i dont workout i just  take this at work about midshift since i have a physically fast paced job and it keeps me going goodthe tasterotten raspberry  lemon rindyeah its badhowever  with a simple trick you can get it tasting actually goodremedy for bad tastewhen i mix me a concoction of this stuff i use an 185 oz plastic bottle and fill it 60 full of filtered water_i use a kitchen funnel and scoop into the bottle 112 scoops of the rootz mix and shake well_get some powdered welchs grape drink mix its actually low sugar per scoop and scoop about only 12  34 a scoop provided in container into the bottle via funnel_ shake well fill up with filtered water shake well again_this will neutralize the awful bitterness  tartness without making it sweet or loading it with sugar_if you prefer it sweet you can add a little more grape mix_as for a remedy for the graininess  if its annoying then get a small marble mocaljete and pummel the powder finer_ i havent done this yet but its a logical solutioni only gave it 4 s because it seems that the makers could easily remedy the terrible taste  graininess pretty easily so for lack of a little effort i couldnt rate it 5
pro easy to use and lightweightcon just keeps me from moving my head without turning my shoulders neck brace doesnt pull my neck up for adjustment like i thought it would
this is something my husband takes with his vitamin regiment  he likes the taste
this is a very nice toothpaste it is definitely funky using toothpaste that is black but you get used to it it tastes pretty good and cleanse your teeth very well i would recommend mixing it up with regular toothpaste though because it can strip your teeth because of the charcoal it does have some bad breath eliminating features which i like and it can help whiten your teeth dont expect to have like bright white teeth because of this but it can neutralize some stains which is nice i really like this one but i am not making this my own and only toothpaste but actually rotate it with another one i use
complete waste of money does nothing just like wearing a regular pair of socks
this is a great product  very powerful  please follow the mixing and use instructions 
the product you get comes in three syringes you apply 1ml to a spoon and eat the gel its fussy and kind of weirdly flavored the whole syringe thing is weird it is best refrigerated after you open each syringe yes i believe it is a good product and effective however the delivery system is really most suitable for people who have syringe fetishes and a lot of time on their hands id much prefer to have had the product in a softgel
i got this for my wife who was in the process to quit smoking  she said the setup for this device was straight forward and the app is easy to use the device is accurate if she had a cigarette the co 2 numbers would be higher for her the co2 number was a clear reminder of the progress that she was making overall she recommends this as it helped her quit smoking
i was so glad to find this supplement at this high dose  im taking this several times a day now every day and can tell it is beginning to help with insomnia foggy feeling and concentration  the main purpose in taking this however is long term as it is supposed to prevent disabling memory loss  and ill do anything i can for that  this brand seems to be top quality and to know what theyre talking about
it feeds your body what it might be lacking its overall something should be apart of your daily routine i would get it again
came in my monthly box works as intended box wasnt damaged seals were intact
these are posted  listed with 33 more loads with 66 as total  i received 2 of the regular size with 25 loads 50 total loads  please correct the listing to reflect the normal size bottles
the foot bath is nicely designed only issue i have is that i like the temperature at 90 degrees even when i set the temperature to 90 degrees it heats up to more than 100 degrees see photo there may be an issue with the thermostat
its so hard to find a chapstick that is both cruelty free and vegan so while i did consider these a bit pricy for chapstick its definitely worth it most of the flavors are amazing i especially love the peach coconut one however the patchouli one is kind of strange it smellstastes like i just smeared incense on my lips and not in a good way it almost has a smell that seems like it should not be going on my lips like i said though the other scents are amazing and very moisturizing definitely will be buying more of these
too too strong to wear i get a headache and lose balance and eyes need to readjust
works well nice good deal
this product contains lead completely shocked its still on the market and being sold disgusted that this product is being sold on amazon
just right shape for shoulders and it holds heat well
this powder mixes in well although the directions say to mix in two whole scoops it tastes pretty good except that it does have a bit of that protein flavorall in all its pretty decent for the price
the rolls are tiny the paper a bit harsh but it does the job
these are my favorite whitening strips i have purchased them twice now i love how gentle they are because my teeth are a little sensitive and i cannot handle the products that come with led lights or professional whitening done by a dentist i have also tried charcoal whitening products and i found them to be too abrasive other brands of whitening strips such as crest i have found too harsh mr bright strips can be left on for 1030 minutes and you can use them occasionally for a touchup or consecutively for the full 14 days i had to write a review for this product because i recommend it to everyone do not expect dramatic results because they are gentle and an otc item but they are definitely worth it i think the results are noticeable and they last for a few months i tend to use these a week before a special event or if i just feel like my teeth are looking dull
these are made in china and the quality shows  the sound is acceptable but not great  the headphones get hot at times and i am worried about that  i dont think these are worth 26 dollars but it seems like that is the lowest price going for these  if you are looking for a cheap headset for a young kid i would get these but dont expect much from them
first of all im a chiropractor that specializes in corrective care and this is my new absolute favorite traction device first of all its adjustable so youll be able to customize the perfect fit for yourself and as far as the design goes its comfortable and snug i noticed immediate relief in tension and increased range of motion bravo chirolux
i think weve used about every wipe there is to use between the 3 of my children8 months to 5 years with newborns pampers was my choice i had to change diapers often and they worked great at working against diaper rash admittedly though as my children got older we gravitated toward huggies wipes pampers seems to have different kinds of wipes there was one kind that seemed so slimy we couldnt bear to use it and it seemed that no matter how hard we tried we ended up with that particular one we keep wipes just about everywhere and use them on our hands tooparticularly during car rides we prefer huggies when it comes to hand usethese are great though when it comes to backsides they are a little more on the slimy side than huggies but these are more durable with huggies wipes theyre constantly tearing or we end up pulling out 4 wipes stuck togetherthese seem to come apartfrom each othermuch better you can tug and pull on these and see just how much more durable they are we generally have better coupons from pampers so we usually end up with pampers wipes ill be honest though and say that when we have the coupons we get huggies wipes we like them both for different reasons we only use one of the two though from my experience and opinion just forget generic brands when it comes to wipesif your little one has a sensitive backside though i highly recommend these these are scented so if that bothers you theres the unscented sensitive kind too
these are great  they really help with polishing up your skin for the summer
handy and usefulholds up well
lots of room for morning and evening medications easy to open and stays closed the cover is good for hiding your pills when you are on vacation the cover is pretty but i expect it to eventually peel due to being pu leather
one of the best tasting low carb bars out there definitely in the top 5  grenade knows how to make a good tasting bar and has spread that knowledge across all flavors  very good
been looking like crazy for a cring of this material no it is not just silicone it is special and it makes the difference i will order 3 more cause i know this one will be stolen
these are really nice maracas off to order another pair
excellent value low cost works greatim a large person and it covers me perfectlyvery soft warm and easy to use no problem with wires getting tangled or feeling hard uncomfortable while wearingcan pull down lower to cover top of legs or put all of it on legs for a nice warm blankethighly recommend
package arrived in great condition nice amount for the low price love these puffs
i got this for my husband because it has a 550 lb weight capacity so i figured it would be pretty durable when it arrived i assembled it and sat on it to try it out one of the wheels immediately broke and i am nowhere close to 550 lbs  i tried to return it but amazon referred me to the manufacturer the link they provided just took me to the sales website the phone number rang to a message service i bought my own set of replacement wheels and its working out ok now
theyre pretty but dont really affect the smoking experience the only time you taste it is if you lick it directly
light weight love the colors and they do not bother my neck when i am wearing them
really sad this heating pad didnt heat very soft and packaged with its own nylon sleeve but that doesnt bring relief to achy muscles sadly had to return
started with the spinach and kale chips the lipo3 spray and the supergreens with beneful i usually dont eat anything when i am fasting but i have been having difficulty getting back on track and this should help after this is out my south beach supplies should be here and i can continue eating healthy and lose the weight i wish to lose by the way the supergreens are just how i like them no yucky flavorings to hide the natural grass and chlorella taste
the only thing i really use out of this set is the glass nail file it works incredibly well the other multicolored files just take up space wasnt pleased with them
i do my own nail tips and i would recommend this product
i have tried a few different versions of neck traction devicesneck stretchers and have found they all are quite similar with some slight variations in size and designthis one is slightly smaller than others something that works well for me at 54 like the others it is not soft despite what it may look like the foam is very hard as its intended to be in order to support your head and neck and to provide a thorough stretch there are also some pressure nodes on the device which are really just bumps in the foam but are positioned to provide a bit of acupressure and massage while youre lying on it personally i dont notice the bumps but its possible theyre doing their jobif youre new to this type of neck device know that it takes a while to get used to it when i first started it was quite painful and i managed only a couple of minutes at a time now i use it once or twice a day for about ten minutes at a time the benefits are immediately noticeable as it relieves the tension in my neck and shoulders that always develops after a day spent at my computerthis particular device unlike others i have used comes with a zippered carryingstorage bag as well as an eye mask and ear plugs none of these are crucial to the neck traction device but are nice extras some reviewers noted a bad smell when they received their device i had no such issues with mineif  youre looking for a way to relieve neck and shoulder pain without resorting to medication this is definitely worth a try
i bought this spray to try in my husbands work boots the scent is a little strong but it seems to do the trick i just spray the inside of his boots after work and generally the next day his feet dont smell the smell could be a little overwhelming for those sensitive to scents
very cheap and its shows but get the job done
works great so far i put it on charge before use didnt take long and light turns green when its chargedlay the clothes flat turned it on and went over a couple shirts with it in a circular motion you could hear it when it cuts off a lint ball its not loud its easy to use and safe to have around kids because there are no sharp pieces exposed unless you open it to clean it outcleaning is also easy you just unscrew the top and guide the included brush along the sides of it and toss the lint i actually was shocked at how much came off just a couple of shirts im glad this works because alot of my clothes started to look worn and ugly with the pilling ive tried an actual razor but that was a pain in the bum so im happy with this product and ive had no issues so far
one thing about senna gon make you go it gets the job done i mixed it with honey and lemon
it cleaned my shower wonderfully
after weighing 250 pounds for the last six yearsincluding during periods when i ate less andor increased my exercise and lost no weight i have dropped to 230 in only three months using mcg i eat whatever i wantalthough i am dramatically less hungry than i ever used to be and i have virtually no cravings for sweets unheardof for me and i am not exercising at all just as a matter of documentation im 46 and 64i have 30 more pounds to lose and the only reason this is a fourstar review instead of a 5star review is that my weight loss does appear to have stopped its been difficult to find clear guidance on whether its safe to take more of the supplement and if so how much more and that too is frustrating i dont know anything about other brands of this stuff although i saw a consumer something or other report in which a couple of the other 34top34 brands were found by laboratory analysis to have either less or none of the active ingredient in them this particular brand was not included in that study at allim not brand loyal by any meansi dont give a darn who makes it and am more than happy to switch if i find a cheaper manufacturerbut i have stuck with miracle because it worked at least this far and i still have three bottles leftto those who tried this and had no benefit i dont know what to say other than that i am sorry for your lack of results i regularly eat steak chicken salmon and halibut rice homemade pasta quality cheese organic fresh fruits and veggies dry roast almonds homemade ice cream and homemade cherry pie a no sugar added recipe for the latter and i drink about 2 cups of twinings green tea every day as i said about i find im hungry for and thus just comfortably eat much less of these foods at eat sitting than ever before and have been happy to do so the supplement is expensive but i have saved a ton of money taking dinner leftovers to work for lunch the next dayassuming i continue to have curbed cravings and reduced appetite and assuming my weight loss resumes soon i really couldnt be happier its hard for me to imagine that this is just a fluke after trying to budge my weight unsuccessfully for six years and then lose 20 pounds in 90 days will it all come back ifwhen i stop taking the supplement is the supplement safe to take longterm to keep my weight down if the cravings return as far as i can tell nobody knows yetif anybody cares ill be happy to post an update as time continues to pass today is may 25 2014
i really like this brand of contact lens cleaner works the best for me
so this is not regular powdered horsetail like you would normally buy  this is 7 so that means they add extra extract which is going to make this stronger and extremely bitter since i eat my herbs like food i dont want this extra extract added to it  the taste is overwhelming and bitter  plus its not green  good fresh dried horsetail powder is supposed to be green  this is also from china  i normally get my powdered horsetail grass from starwest herbs and its organic and from croatia and tastes wonderful and fresh  this stufftastes gross wrong color not organic and from china  i bought this because it was cheaper than the starwest so i thought id give it a try  but totally not worth it  you get what you pay for  im going back to the more expensive horsetail from starwest which is exactly the way horsetail is supposed to look and taste  i like bulksupplements normally  for supplements and amino acids vitamins minerals and chemicaltype stuff  i highly recommend bulk supplements for vitamins and supplements their quality is good and the price is excellent  for herbs i would recommend starwest or frontier  definitely not bulksupplements
works well
this is my 34th order i am using it for my cats with renal issues so far it seems to really be helpful i just add it to the daily drinking water and all drink from it  so the do not mind any taste if there is  one  it dissolves easily in water
bought these due to the coating hoping they would help in the lower gut did nothing if fact sometimes they pass right through whole  undigested 12 hours later
purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder  it is less messy than regular powder however it doesnt work as well  and it is oddly greasy  he reports that it is lotiony in a weird way  since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry  if its lotiony or greasy not so muchif youre hoping for a replacement for powder  this isnt it  at least in my husbands opinion
so glad to have found this supplement in a large quantity at a low price it is the exact same supplement i was getting at my drug store at a much higher price
i have one heaping teaspoon a day and its like eating 3 lbs of carrots  could you eat 3 lbs of carrot a day i know i canta great product
since i plugged this in a week ago and my litter box cleaning days have not changed i am having no odor at all   revealing the existence of a cat in my house  it makes almost no noise and the only indication that it is on is a soft blue light and a slight breeze  i cant attest to it creating a germless environment  how do you test that   but just for the odor management this is worth the price  we are in the midst of allergy season and i havent experienced  any lessening of symptoms so it may not be much help with allergies  if you have a cat or dog though this is a winner
super big bottles and ample amount for the price  i was already familiar with this brand and have trusted it  easy to swallow  no fishy aftertaste or burps  really no complaints or regrets
these were great for my birthday i definitely would recommend it for anyone looking for decorations
these hemostats are very hard to open and close almost impossible to do with one hand ive used many different pairs of hemostats over the years and these are really just terrible
so far my husband loves this dental plaque remover this is not going to take the place of your dental hygienist but it will help maintain in between my husband has crooked teeth so this helpsthe instructions are pretty much nonexistent so that is huge minus when it comes to this product you would basically have to figure it all out on your ownoverall the product seems to work but time will tell just need to have better instructionsnote take off the flimsy rubber tips first
not good nail cutters
mens potty portable pee bottle portable urinals for men reusable male pee bottle camping toilet thicken mens potty  nice to have in an emergency i am putting this in my emergency kit to save for an emergency  oz
love it it works no bug bites or sunburns plus no icky bug spray smell i use it on my 8 month old and no rash or reactions
works well and price is good
i had to return this item as the handle was stuck and would not come out of the case  it was totally stuck and would not budge  i wrote to frank shaving company in china and they were not helpful i bought another wsp monarch silver tip badger to replace the returned item
not bad better then my car seat
some people only refer to facial tissue with one word dont be like those peoplepros  softer than the eponym  better boxes than the eponymcons  why are you reading this add them to your subscriptions  seriously stop  im leaving this review while my wife watches some singing show i wonder who is under this rhino mask
product was received on time and in great condition im a satisfied customer mls
thank you in advance to the amazon vine program for providing an item to review a positive review was not required nor was it requested and all words are my ownmy mother and i suffer from chronic pain  knees back shoulderpart of pain management is heat therapy in some cases  moist heatit is difficult to get a moist heating pad and its also difficult to get it to contour or fit the difficult areas  knees shoulder  ankle either youre awkwardly sitting laying or balancing somethingid been seeing and hearing about these microwave packs and took a chance on itthis was a dual pack so that meant one for my almost 70 year old mom who lives with me and one for mefirst thing that struck me when i got the package  what the heck did i order it was heavy i almost worried that perhaps id gotten something i couldnt usei took one and gave one to my mothershe was the first to use it she loved it only 120 seconds 2 minutes in the microwave and it lasts for about 10 minutes she can place it on her shoulder and it stays put the moist heat does the trick in alleviating paina few days after she tried hers my knee was in horrific pain it was so bad i was dragging it around so i warmed mine up and as hers didnt get that warm  i went three 3 minutes i wrapped it around my knee with the velcro and  wow it was hot i could barely tolerate it so this really gets hot ive had regular heating pads on high heat and barely felt it this  i felt iti didnt have it on that long but i can state  this gets warm and it stays warmthe velcro closure is heavy duty and i felt like i might end up tearing the poor thing the weight makes sure it stays in placewe love it and honestly it might the last heating pad we ever get also  theyre huge
i absolutely love these prerolls first off they are made out of natural cotton cellulose water and glycerin  all natural ingredients  not plastic  and they smoke sooooo well i highly recommend purchasing 
i have been wanting to buy a henry mask for a while finally i bought one it is so welldesigned and fits my face nicely they are breathable as described also they are stylish the straps are very comfortable and do not aggravate me i will be buying more of these masks
i hate vinegarany  i read it is good for so many things i thought i would give it a try
works good for my mother who is 91
i bought this because i read that it helps with constipation issues after taking this supplement for several days i found my constipation issue were much worse and i was bloating a lot i would not recommend this supplement if your looking to alleviate constipation
seems to be legit  i get a little nervous buying from 3rd parties due to possible knock offs
my husband said he was not impressed by this flavor and it took a lot to get a hint of the orange he did say he got a hit of orange creamsicle taste but it too a great deal of the product to get that hint also this product is not part of prime and the shipping cost was more then the price i paid so not a great bargain unless you were to buy many more flavors this is not the first capella flavor he has tried and while they indeed taste like the descriptions it takes a great deal more product to achieve then other brands now this is in reference to using it to make homemade vape juice and im sure if using for food purposes the flavor would be must stronger all in all its just ok and will not be ordering again
acai is great if you want to reduce your appetite if you eat for pleasure then it might not work as well i found that in two months of taking this supplement i didnt lose a great deal of weight as reported in some reviews but i did see dramatic results in the clarity and radiance of my skin this supplement contains powerful antioxidants which protect the cells from free radicals so if you are interested in skin health then i can recommend this to you for me it hasnt helped me lose weight in a dramatic way as advertised in many blogsthe rebecca review
these pads work great nice
this glasses strap stays on the glasses even with thin ear pieces  i would order it again
love this its  all natural its lasts a very long time have found a way to make this to save money
works good my legs are so soft after i use this
compact classy little pill case not much else to say its so simple but looks nice on my keychain with brown leather and other brass items
cute packaging and i like the scooper because it makes it really easy to fill my water bottles this cherry flavor is really off it has a weird aftertaste thats sort of plastickyi drink caffeine powder mixes daily and this wasnt what i expected it didnt smell weird to me like another person commented but the flavor isnt good at all  the other flavors might be better
best stuff ever  cant be without  good for joints  i feel and look hydrated highly recommended
these socks are great the fabric is soft smooth lovely feels really nice next to my skin i love how colorful  fun these compression socks are because all ive found up until now were just drab tan black or white stockings that looked hideous just because i have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities feet calves doesnt mean i want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose these are so cute bright  colorful the only downside is that i am wearing these due to leg swelling  when my calves are real swollen which is often unfortunately the design on some of these socks gets stretched out making it so you lose the very thing that makes these so pretty the design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost at times  not so colorful this hasnt happened on all the ones ive purchased i have about 6 pairs but definitely on some of them if youre very thin or dont experience much swelling this probably wont be a problem at all a solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes maybe just small  large
i like these pacific gloves there nicer then other gloves i have bought beforethe gloves are very comfortable not the heavy thick ones  that i have bought at the grocery store before thathave always been too big clumsy  and uncomfortable and i usually would only use about 3 times and forget about themthese are a size medium fit me but the small would have been better i have long thin fingersthe inside is soft and actually feels goodi use these pacific gloves for doing the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and washing my heavy cast iron pansthese gloves get a good grip on heavy cookwarei also like the sleeves  are long and the water does not run inside and i use them for gardeninggood price for two utility gloves
not for me stomach upset
i love this dry brush  ive never heard of dry brushing before but im glad i did  the dry brush is very invigorating  i used it on the backs of my arms and legs and my back in circular motions i wish now i had bought the handle my husband helped me it felt so good and left my skin with a rosy glow  after showering i felt the circulation much improved in all the areas i brushed  first day it just felt good the second time i used it i noticed my skin tightening a bit and the skin on my arms felt softer even my lotion seemed to absorb better  im very satisfied with the construction of the brush also  its well worth what i paid  the strap is secure and it has a groove in the back to attach a handle which im purchasing right away
these are surprisingly thicker than i imagined but still allowed me enough maneuverability to get dishes and household cleaning done my hands are on the smaller side so this is always an ongoing issue for being as sturdy as they are i like that i could still use them these gloves provide a great alternative to anyone with latex issues only used these for a week or so but there are no signs of wear on them as yet
this flavor is scrumptious very soft and creamy almost feels like a full calorie full sugar dessert but without all the carbs and sugars very satisfying to me just remember to warm them in a micro for just a few seconds thats the big catch so dont plan on using them for on the go unless you leave them someplace warm where they will stay soft
great pads and they wash up nice only issue is that since the cleaning agents are in the disposable pads from irobot you get just plain water unless you spray your floors with cleaner i used the wet mop pads to get the sticky dirty stuff and then used a disposable to get the floors clean by running the mop again
these detergent packs have a really awful odor when you open the container  i didnt want them to be scented and they arent but they have an offputting odor for sure  they do not make the dishes or the air smell bad thankfully  they also work very well and do not leave any residue on the dishes  4 stars for that smellbleh
great product only issue is getting it on the walker so its stable and also i suggest having a two sided rubber trivit like a jar opener to reduce anything sliding on the tray when you walk
i have been using this for grilling and salads and it tastes great i am not too crazy about the plastic bottle though so i used it to top off a glass bottle that i had previously used and will continue to add to that one it has a very smooth taste and many many uses
this massager is ok  i can recline in my zerogravity chair and its pretty nice behind my low back holds up to my weight but i can tell its starting to struggle a little as opposed to another brand i have that doesnt give in at all i also wouldnt advertise it as a neck massager  its too wide for the neck scrapes the outline of the traps but thats about it not bad on upper back its a onetrick pony but thats what these little massage pillows are its a 35  pretty good not great and compared to another one ive reviewed slightly underwhelming enough to not give it a 4
works as intended
this is an attractive and giftable set of six bath bombs the amazon site says the four fragrances are lavender vanilla rose and orange but it was hard for me to detect those aromas they all smell nice  but the fragrance difference is super subtle they are made with essential oilsi tried the greenishbluishyellow bomb in my foot bath i used hot to tepid water and suds were created in the foot bath and the bomb fizzed as shown in the video it eventually in about 10 minutes dissolved in the water as i bathed my feet my feet felt clean and i liked the subtle scent my feet also came out feeling  soft unfortunately there was a slight adherence of the green color of the bomb to my ankles and heels but it was ever so slight a white bathtub might develop a slight ring of color around it from these bombs but i suspect it would immediately wash off insofar as performance these bombs are really good luckily i had a strainer in my sink because i had no idea there was a surprise miniature animal figurine in these i had a little dinosaur in mine although no price is listed i suspect these will be priced between 1699 and 1899
i need dark to sleep  these do the job blocking light perfectly and comfortably
cute nail trimmer gets the job done
they were all tangled up together in a baggy they are awfully thin and of poor quality several of them broke after 2 or 3 uses they were packaged in a sloppy manner
i take it with meals especially ones that are heavy in fat and it helps with digestion i used to get bloated and my motility bowel movements would be slow but taking this product along with my main meals gets ride of the bloating also i feel a little more energy  in a sense that since i am not bloated all the time i have an easier time to move around and be active
i compared this with elderberry emergenc ec  the ingredients are similar as far as sugar 5g vit d3 125 and 50mg elderberry  this one has 25mg zinc227 compared with 10mg with ec vitamin c is low at 270mg 1000mg ec i like more vit c  this one does have turmeric root extract 140mg which scores with me  salt is the 4th ingredient with 23 of daily sodium 29 chloride  thats a lot for me  i definitely taste ityou absolutely need to mix this in 16ou of water  it doesnt fizz  stir it  mild citrus taste  overall not my cup of sports drink or immunity drink  i think if youre out sweating hard like a lineman in a football game or prefer more nacl than this will work for you  the ingredients and packaging otherwise look good
you cannot curl lashes with this product but the customer service is great i returned without any problems
nice large 21oz bottle of a body lotion i have not heard of beforethe scent is cherry almond the first scent i smelled when using this is cherry which is not my favoritei like almond better but the scent does not last longthis is not a greasy lotion it goes into my skin my legs and hands have been very dry and my other lotionswhere not helping muchbut this mountain falls seems to help to soften my hands and the do look better in a short timeim not a fan of some of the ingredients in this  so i was surprised my hands do not look so old after using this a fewtimes a daycame nicely packaged and no leaks but the trouble i had with this bottle was getting the pump to come up soi could use thisnot deducting for that
not more than a glorified piece of velcro not what was expected
this has really helped with the styes in my eyes i had about 2 on the rim of my upper eye lid and one on the rim of my lower eye lid and i had a couple of styes on my other eye too i used to apply this oil 23 times a day with a q tip after going through a couple of bottles i found they had all disappeared one after the other over a period of 12 months no side effects nothing
i loved it i just barely got it it arrived pretty fast it looks way better then i thought it would feels and looks high end it works waayyy better than some high ends eyelash curlers i have had  can be compared to other ones that i bought for a ridiculous price i super recomend this one you get a great product for an amazing price
i buy a lot of turmeric powder either from amazon or from my nearest multicultural food market  i make what is called golden paste out of turmeric coconut oil water and freshly ground black pepper  it has helped me and my husband immensely with bone and joint health  im 62 and play very competitive tennis singles and doubles against opponents less than half my age and i often win  i am a true believer in the miracle of golden paste as my previously super sore and creaky knees have been transformed into those of a 25 year olds  no kidding  please google golden paste and see how easy it is to make at home and give it a try  when this organic turmeric came up on my list of items i could review it took less than a nano second to select it  i think its wonderful it comes in 3 smaller bags instead of one big one and it seems to be among the best organic turmeric ive used
these work great to wipe if you can keep hold of them they slide all around and they dry out pretty fast i think if they were each maybe twice as big it wouldnt be so difficult to use these to remove nail polish i have to stack 2 together to effectively remove the nail polish but they are lint free there no problem there
while packaged attractively and according to the company website  all organic ingredients it is not clear how much evidence there is for the longterm or short term effectiveness of the aromatherapy blends  this particular blend is heavy on ginger but dissipates very quickly  while no doubt the initial whiff provides a positive awakening energy it doesnt linger long enough to be able to notice significant change in mood or any symptoms  unsure if at this price point it provides significant advantage over using ones own blends in diffusers
i was ready to throw my shoes in the garbage this saved them after 2 applications
christmas hat that is cute and fits nicely
bought this for my daughters law and she just loves it she gets to practice at home away from her job she was pleased so i am satisfied the delivery was quick and the packaging who great
these are so handy to have around especially if youre really into health and beauty stuff they are on the thin side when you open them up and remind me of gauze just a little thicker and more absorbent but i find theyre very useful folded as is in the containeri use these with my toner or just to blot my face after washing and before adding my serum i also use them to wrap up open beauty products so that they dont get all dusty or damaged ie brushes in that way theyre best opened up and wrapped around the itemthis is a huge pack so if you just use 12 a day like me its going to last a good amount of time these are also good when doing mild chemical peels at home  for applying the peelserum to your face much like cotton ballsrounds these are a musthave for any beauty enthusiasta discounted sample was provided for evaluation and unbiased review
for my condition the male comfort fit  advantage is easy to use and easy to empty and clean in the morning
i finally have to admit that im getting older and my feet hurt when i wear boots in particular  after a couple of hours in i have to take them off or sit down because the balls of my feet will burn and its just uncomfortablei have some knee damage and i broke my foot a few years ago so these days even more than before i am aware of how uncomfortable feet affect my mood  my posture and my balancewhen you are not walking straight and even late  it can affect your hip and lower back as well  these insoles are an absolute godsend in my pictures youll see how much thicker they are near the balls of the feet than the ones you get at the store  or even the custom ones i had made at a local store nothing beats these for comfort the gel is thick and distributes evenly in such a way that i feel like im wearing my slippers all day i live in south texas where boots are an absolute staple in the summer or winter and these insoles have made such a differenceyou will have to cut them down to size just like with most insoles that you buy at the store  and since they are thicker than any others i have ever bought i do need to wear thinner socks but since boots western ones in particular tend to be a little roomier  these insoles work perfectly with themi dont know what negative ion technology is but i really dont need to know the details all i need to know is that these will stay in my boots and i will replace them every six months as recommended because ive never been more comfortable in my boots after wearing them the first day my daughter borrowed them from me and put them in her shoes because she was planning on a long day at school and work she too was amazedat 23 years old she has discovered that gel insoles are not just for old ladies like her mom i never thought id be sitting here riding along review about my feet come on my boots or insoles but here i am raving about my latest discovery i can definitely recommend this to anyone
was suppose to come with a case and it didnt and it doesnt work good at all
bright colors on black background on a good sized poster  colors pop  only complaint would be that i wish was more detailed  the 6 x 4 book cover to accompany the poster has more detail just harder to see  for a beginner is perfect
great product  i recently purchased and used emmys best pet odor  stain eraser  my dog was a naughty puppy and urinated in our family room and the odor was strong after receiving the product i carefully followed the instructions that came with it  the results are astounding it worked there is no more odor no more stain and my dog does not show any interest in returning to the spot  i will be a repeat customer
this is great for when i get really wound up tackling too many projects at once when my body is tired but my brain wont shut down to sleep and when i cant stay asleep for a good nights rest i like that it is a natural source of melatonin plain melatonin is synthesized because it occurs in such small amounts naturally i take this amino acid with others to support my health i trust source naturals i havent found any problems with their products on consumer labs website ive been taking ltryptophan for a couple years intermittently and daily for the past three months
i read the reviews and was scared it might break when installing so i called drive medical and a tech walked me through each step not only that but he took the model number and installed one with me while we were on the phone that way he was able to give more detailed instructions when the upper washer seemed to not fit well it got installed in about 5 minutes with no tools and is perfect for me there are more expensive models but this has all the features recommended by my occupational therapist in fact she installed it with me she thought it important for me to have an onoff switch in the handle and the ability to divert water into the regular shower head as needed its the perfect length color and very easy for me to handle plus it came in 24 hours and i didnt pay extra
i recommend this to everyone this is a life saver if you have a baby or a child that has nose discharge or is congested i would definitely use this it saves time and energy it has different settings for suction and easy to clean
very happy  good quality  packaging and product quick delivery
for the money its really worth it plus more ive not had any issues with it and ive had it for a year it helps so much
i followed the instructions and this product seemed to help my slow kitchen drain  it has been about two weeks now since i finished using it and everything seems to be working well i will get more and use it as maintenance to keep my drain clear i really liked that it was so easy to use and each dose was in its own bottle so all i had to do was shake it and pour the liquid down the drain no mixing or measuring
ive went through about 4 foot spa machines and this by far is the best and i will surely keep it is big enough space for my husband who is a size 11 and he says he still has a lot of room second i love the remote control and drain something ive not really considered and am glad i got this honestly i got this on a whim thinking id just return it if i end up not liking it did not read that it had a remote lol as you see in the video it works so hooray the drain is kinda slow but dont let that stop you if spillage is your concern this drains slowly and no spills third the heater works unlike some that only retain the heat this one really heats up the water for you i know because i put cold tap water and heated it to 40 fourth i loooove the rollers at the bottom this made filling up and then moving it near the couch so easy no carrying for me less mess less spillage fifth the cover and the tools that came with it they are useful bonuses if you are like me who like to keep things dust free the cover is something that you will surely appreciate and of course the tools at first i didnt use them but they helped to get the smaller areas of my husbands feet i dont know how to use all of them but im sure they will all play a role someday lol overall recommend steep price but it isnt your regular foot spa it is worth it i promise
very comfortable to wear they really are as comfortable as a pair of glasses even with a shield attachedunfortunately there is such a gap on each side i would not wear this without a mask underneath these face shields would be useful if you are only expecting something to splatter right between your eyes or in the exact middle of your face nowhere elseso these are fine depending on the level of protection youre looking forthe shields attach with a pulloff tape that sticks to the eyeglass portion
i like that it has a backlight for easy reading it is also quite accurate
these masks are soft and comfortable to wear but i wear eyeglasses and these masks do nothing to prevent fogging when you are wearing the mask although the fabric is 2 ply your breath freely passes through the fabric and causes instant eyeglass fogging whenever the temperatures are cool since i live in minnesota cold temperatures are a constant issue very disappointed i expected more from this purchase
this toothbrush is just ok rated 3 stars the toothbrush base itself feels very lightweight and cheap the heads are very hard to get on and the bristles feel pretty cheap and soft the toothbrush does have a few different types of modes of vibration patterns but im not sure how that would benefit the user
they could be a little thicker so they hold the loop better
this is great for my contacts  i use it to rinse off the contact solution they stay in each night and i love being able to get 3 cans at once
disappointed and frustrated with myself for being fooled by great marketing blueberry bliss is actually soy and different kinds of sugar in a bar they taste just ok and are not a healthy alternative to other sweets just another bar full of soy and other crap dont waste your money nothing blissful about this bari hope ive finally learned my lesson most bars are junk
i have very dry skin and this cream works wonders lasts 24 hours on my body but due to washing my hands so much i have to reapply several times a day well worth the price
doesnt always give accurate numbers
we are enjoying this as a thickening agent from pudding to finger jello
bath wrap
super comfortable makes traveling long distances in the vehicle much less painful for my hips and sacroiliac joints i love it my husband tried the cushion and enjoyed it so much that he wanted one now he loves his too
i love that they wont able to slide off my glasses
this is a white noise sound machine with a total of 6 sounds it sits up like an alarm clock i love that it is battery operated i charged it overnight this comes with a usb cable not the typical micro usb perhaps type c the unit itself and an instruction pamphlet operation is simple as per my video press and hold the onoff button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off  rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook thunder white noise wave wind and bonfire all but one sound is pure annoying noisethe timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off it means the timer is offthere is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on the nightlight button is in the center top there are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light  the first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial the second press turns on one side of dots then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off the next press keeps all the dots lit this is what they call breathing lightsthe volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volumethe current price of 1619 2699 minus 40 would be extremely reasonable for this if i liked it but i do not it has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights i like the look of this and that it is battery operated i also like the simple operation however the two most important features nightlight and sound are lackluster in my opinion
these bars literally make you forget youre eating them for energy  they taste more like a snack food but they work wonders  the variety pack is a great way to try new flavors too
one pair actually went too far into my ear was able to get it out with tweezer the bigger set does not block out most noise
this works like a dream simple perfect curls but there is a huge problem it doesnt stay charged to curl your whole head i got a little over halfway done and the battery died it was only on for about 20 minutes who has time to stop and recharge halfway through styling so sad because it works great but the battery dying is unacceptable
gets the job done and the spray smells wonderful nice microfiber towel too  youll definitely want this product to keep your yoga mat clean
good for my yard waste
excellent bee pollen good to eat by the spoonful if you can afford it very satisfying if it was half the price i would add it to half my dishes
i bought this unit because i have a lot of shoulder and neck pain this is my second tens unit and it is definitely better than the first one i had i am very nearsighted and 70 years old and i can easily read the screen on this one i dont have to get out my magnifying glass to read the screen  which is very important when youre uncomfortable  and trying to get some reliefit arrived packaged very well as you can see from the video i attached and even fits back into the box which is unusual i will keep this unit and a few pads and the manual in the enclosed pouch and store it right by my recliner that way i can keep the box in my closet and just have the tidy pouch sitting right by my chair where i need it i usually use the pads for 30 minutes and find that my neck and shoulders are much improved the pads stay sticky after many uses so this unit will be by my side for a long time my sister tried it out  i was so impressed she pulled out her phone and ordered one right from the recliner this saves me a lot of trips to the chiropractor and lot of copays  it definitely pays for itself quickly it was an excellent purchase
the low pressure from this replacement renders  the machine uselessupdate within 3 months of purchasing the bigger side button sticks which most certainly renders the machine useless
this doesnt smell as strong as some others but it is a large quantity of eucalyptus oil for the price
we live in savannah georgia this is the only thing that keeps the bugs sand gnats away it is little oily but it works
great price works as expected
the opening isnt as wide as expected  i would look elsewhere if you are looking for a toenail cutter for thick nails  i will have to keep looking
great product i thought the bottle was glass not plastic but i love that its not easy to break and looks very expensive easy to swallow
these dont work as well as i remember them working as a kid but does the job 12 even 14 tablet works just as well as a whole fun for the kids but i wont order them again  not worth the price
this was a test with something i am not real femilure with  not a product for me but i have seen my mom use them before
used them when i had to stand for a long time  helps my feet a lot
the vitamin c in these gummies is ascorbic acid and scientific research says thats not really vitamin c  i think the best ingredient in these gummies is the zinc  zinc is a good at helping the immune system to fight off cold viruses  these gummies taste great and i could eat the entire bottle in one sitting if i didnt exercise control but im not too keen on the vitamin c source
great product and reasonable price for the quality
love that this is compostable  gets way more junk out of my teeth than glide floss tmi i know
they might have more omega3s but its really hard to see any actual effect vs other pills  these arent quite as big as some but not as small as others
perfect for icing my lower back when inflamed with arthritis
very thin do not fit well
these panties are hands down the most comfortable undies ive owned period the sizing is perfect and they dont ride up or down ever  you can tell these are qualitymade panties as the texture feels sturdy yet they are incredibly soft to touch i can tell they will last also another great feature about these panties is that they dont show the panty line when youre wearing tight pants for such comfortable wear you will not look like youre wearing granny pantiesi bought these for 3990 and it appears the price has gone down a bit  now 3690 but i will definitely be purchasing another pair here in a couple of months
what a fabulous footcare product this is the metallic turquoise coating of this handheld file device is visually attractive and the ergonomic design gives it a shape thats extremely easy to grip and comfortably hold the bottom surface features a whole sea of circular nanoblades that painlessly file away rough and dry skin in an instant and then the powdered skin particles immediately rinse away with ease the foot scrubber arrives with a drawstring plastic pouch thats great for storage between uses and i would highly recommend this affordable product to all my friends and family im so impressed with this one

lets face it unlike men it can be difficult for a woman to go to the bathroom outside we purchased some acreage and needed something that would be easy to use with our luggable loo this product was convenient and did a pretty good job controlling waste smell
these clippers are sold under various brand names but have one thing in commonthey do the job regular clippers that are of the same design always used to scare me because for what ever reason they were too imprecise and often ended up cutting into the nails quick and frankly made me avoid clipping my nails until they were past due eventually i gave up using clippers and just used the scissors in my swiss army knife which lead to imprecise cuts that needed filing to look acceptable but at least they didnt draw blood  thick solid build that made me realize just how cheaply regular clippers were stamped out the cutting edges are precisely machined and in the 8 years i have owned them there is no perceived dulling of the cutting edges  the product should last a life time  a lot of time i have just held them and admired how precisely they were built and how attractive the results were i own both sizestoenaillarge and fingernailsmall and find the small size hard to to get a firm grip oni would recommend caution about  the small size regardless of your finger size and opt for the large regardless for both toe and fingernails the only thing approaching second rate is the brand name decal stuck in the indentation the clippers themselves should have green bell stamped on back they sold as seki edge but are the same green bell clippers
had difficulty finding in retail stores pleased to have found it online really good product and easy to use no harsh chemical smell and easy to rinse off leaving no residue
not worth it at all its as if i didnt use anything yes it was on taught and tight no as you can see it let water in and soaked the  gauze that was covering the stiches that i had to keep dry
product as described i have straight super fine long hair it takes a while to detangle even with this brush i wouldnt say its a miracle but its better than yanking through with a traditional brush
i was very dissapointed  for the last year all i have heard is that wraps and herbal gels are the best thing since sliced bread  well i was not impressed  i applied the herbal body wrap gel sold by forever young to my thighs and arms  the amazon ad said to just apply the gel to targeted areas  well i did  i did twice a day  i did this for a week  nothingi was using this as a jumpstart to my new yoga and new lifestyle  i know nothing is a golden pill to a perfect body but seriously i did expect somethingdisclosure  i purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback  the above review is my opinion
great product  ive ordered this product several times for my great uncle who brushes his teeth too hard
i like ked this bottle but after using it on my glasses it seems to quit working so i thought it was a glass cleaner never said that so i cleaned my glasses first and spray lasted about 34 hours nice convienant bottle
i love this
i love my hot heart massager its reusable and remains ready to use until you flex the internal metal button the solution inside then crystallizes producing heat in the process the heart remains flexible even after the crystals have formed making it suitable for hot massage
fit true to sizegreat quality comfortable non fading good pricegoid timing but after wearing 4 times started to see holes in leg area disappointed
this twopack glove set is well made comfortable and durable the blue pair has a thin flocked lining that feels soft against my skin and the unlined gloves are very durable i feared they may be too short to reach the bottom of a 5gallon bucket but they are plenty long and end about 3 below my elbow the size medium was a perfect fit and even though they are thicker gloves they are still flexible and tactile i recommend these
there are 30 shiny gold boxes that are perfect for christmas gifts cookies cupcakes or other classy but lightweight gifts they come in one piece and unfold easily into a reasonablysized box the bottom is interlocking and just unfolds easily into place each box should be able to fit about one to two pounds of cookies depending on the size of the cookie i can even get an appropriatelysized tiny cake in this box overall i think these are classy and wellmade but they are thinner than i expected therefore these are for lightweight items only also i would recommend using tissue paper or foil on the bottom before using to carry treats to stabilize the box a bit the current price of 1799 is competitive as it comes to 60 cents each box
this summer my pops ended up looking like rudolph the red nose reindeer from the weightfriction of his glasses luckily these were available  i got em for him hes now back to his normal grouchy self minus the red nose 
this shake tasted horrible i tried mixing it with different things to mask the flavor but it not help
the stool is very easy to assemble it rolls very easily over either floors or carpets the cushion is comfy i read some reviews complaining of its longevity i hope mine holds up for a long time
convenient way to store  protect credit cards from fraud  easy push button opener  fits all my cards and slides easily into my pocket or purse  peace of mind

i love swanson products and this is a mainstay in our home for things like poison ivy prevention or treatment certain pain etc  do a search on rhus tox and what it is all for
wholly jumpin judas does regular tissues after a couple of days of runny nose tear the space between your nose holes as raw as a bad fitting sneakers in a marathon a couple days of sniffles is endurable but that raw skin under your nose laststhese are the genuine best solution ive found do yourself a big favor with these
love this brand and their beautiful designsgood pricing great quality too this is my third pair 
wonderful or someone like me who uses them each morning i have a box in every room in my house couldnt  live without them on hand
well one size will fit most skinny people i doubt thesewill accomodate plus sizes or curvy figures that being said they are nicely made the waist band is wide and textured the insides are soft fleece while the exterior is smooth they do stretch but not far they are form fitting but comfortable instructions say to hand wash not in this lifetime i laundered in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle turned out fine
blocks out all light but does not stop sounds completely
we have been using happy bowls for the last couple of years and we wouldnt go camping without them  these are the best invention since sliced cheese
hii purchased a large container of berry lemonade i do like it i only wish i know the source of color its blue id prefer a more natural color
i have been taking this liquid vitamin daily and at first the taste is not great at all you eventually get used to the taste after a few days i have already noticed an increase in my energy level since taking this
i thought the smell was awful my three kids tasted it and they all hated it they usually love this kind of stuff i give them lemonflavored liquid fish oil which they love and it looks like well continue with thatmade with algae and it smells and tastes like it the citrus flavor only seems to make it worse
these are very soft and comfortable i have wide hands and did not feel any restriction wearing them i was able to keep them on all night the gloves and ancient greek remedy oil helped my winter beaten cooking cleaning hands in one night better than any daytime hand cream that really doesnt fix the damaged skin
simple to use easy to clean  unfortunately it uses a lot of water to create the vacuum so thats a downside  i could use siphoning as a means to change water in my tank but the distance to the sink from my tank is 30 feet so its a little difficult to make it happen easily but could be in the future because of the water usage
i love this soaker so much that i purchased more for family members
im older and have some recurring pains  my right shoulder is the worst  it is part of carpal tunnel syndrome from typing most of my life  some days my right shoulder feels like concrete has been poured in the joints making my shoulder heavy and hard to move plus painful  i place a pad on the front just above my armpit and then one pad on the back usually around the outer edge of the shoulder blade  i could attach two more pads but usually two is enough  i then choose a pattern strength and time and let the tens unit do the rest  the electrical charge that passes aroundthrough the muscle mass in that area does help to ease the stiffness and pain  i cant say how much this helps me  all i can say is that it does help and is a great way to relieve pain without using drugs
was great but some of the letters did not have a valve to put air in so we could not blow up
perfect weight and good quality
ive had trouble making fermented vegetables w just sea salt so wanted to try a culture  my veggies turned out great with this culture will be making more soon
its ok but my hair dye was too thick  i couldnt use the bottle normallykind of expensive
it works great for scrubbing but the 360 swivel action has a mind of its own  it does not stay in a locked position
blended well into my smoothies not much taste difference with the other vegetables and things
more of a dull gold vs bright gold
this japanese style bench is a great addition to my bathroom i love the ease of sitting under the shower and washing my legs and feet and not having to worry about balancing myself get one i think you will be very happy with this purchase
i love this dental floss and i cant find it anywhere locally i hope they havent stopped making it already this is the same kind my dentists office gives me a sample of each time i go in for cleaning its the only floss that i can get comfortably in between my teeth
all natural formula each serving contains 40 billion cfu a serving is 2 capsules  they promise a minimum potency of 20 billion could by the expiration date theres 60 capsules in the bottle the probiotics strains listed there are 4 of them seem to be similar to others with names like bifidobacterium andclactobacillus etc the difference in this product being the macktrek bipass technology which appears to refer to the specific blend and how it survives into your system the capsules are easy to swallow gel caps and theyre defined as shelf stable the bottle i got has an expiration date approximately 5 months from when i received them
our carafe was a nasty mess inside but no more this product is easy to use and extremely effective
used this to make my vanilla love this stuff best vanilla ever would buy again
i like this product works well
as expected but cant hang on the side of a wheelchair because its too long and rubs against the wheel
product description was incorrect on size  was not even close on fitting
not sure why anyone would buy any others on here that do not have the correct ingredients spending money for no impact on whatever health issues you are having this is really good and comes with instructions on how to brew it it works
these little cord locks make all the difference in mask fitting and comfort  i use a tiny crochet hook to slip them on to the cord  i make masks and people like this option on them
a very close personal friend of mine has recently lost a few of her furry kids that she has had for around 15 years she has been really heart broken and it doesnt help that she has a few more kitties around the same age she does cat rescue and even though she has several other kitties she takes it very hard when she loses 1 of her beloved petsshe doesnt have any children of her own so her animals are her babies she also lost her beloved father a few years ago so she has had her share of sadness so i have been thinking about making her a bracelet that would have  charms to do with cats and dogs and maybe something to do with her dad kind of like a remembrance braceletthis wing charm is perfect to add to my remembrance braceletthis is the  flora mcqueen personalized guardian angel wing charm birthstone charms mother bracelet charm fmc2001by anmaoprosthe wing meansgauadian angelnickel freestainless steelso it wont rusthole size is 48 mm to 5 mmeco friendlyhypoallergeniccomes with a gift bagfits pandora braceletsconsabsolutely nonei received this product to test  for free and i was only asked to give my honest opinion i did not receive any type of compensation for doing so all opinions are my own or that of my husband if he helped me to test it if i have a change of mind after i have tested it longer i will come back and update my review whether good or bad
the picture is not what i got i got the short ones with the pointed end which are much poorer quality than the ones in the photo with the squared end
i bought these for cleaning out little things around the house that you couldnt get a cloth inside they are very handy
the product is awesome but the sellers sometimes cut the fabric into multiple pieces giving you a small cloth to use be careful
i ordered the wrong size so i cannot tell you how well they work or dont work i will have to wait to get a new grandbaby to find out i will update when i can test them
well made sturdy and easy to use the doors open in the same direction making it easier to get out pills  the boxes are the largest ive seen  only problem is that the pills can get stuck in groove between am and pm boxes but each row can be lifted out easily to get the pills out of the groove
solid construction and efficient this ear and nose trimmer does a nice job of trimming without any pulling or risk of injury its not terribly loud either recommended
got since we have cats i liked that it only needed changed once a year and with just a light bulb with the litter boxes i was hoping it would help with any smell one of my cats also has asthma so hoped it would help her not sure it has really helped with any of that and have one in each room i do not like that they added a coupon into each box and said for your purchases you would get this credit though it wasnt for each one and only for one yet put one in each box and didnt say for only one on them so didnt like the false advertising included wouldnt of bothered to enter all of them if it would of stated that
wasnt a very noticeable change
hear these are just the best to use grabbed 3 packs
i believed this may help with leg crampsnot so sure  i didnt notice any wow effect
great deal good price and good quality will definitely purchase again
more than likely if you are using this you are under the care of a doctor  it is a fabulous dressing although admittedly expensive  i wish mine lasted several days but a day is all i see to be able to get out of them before they need to be changedit is good that there is no adhesive border  wounds are typically irregular in shape and the entire area most be covered  if you can not find one large enough you can use two together  if there was an adhesive border it would then stick to the wound which would be harmful  it is much easier to use your own adhesive which you know will not irritate your skin  as my skin is easily irritated it is necessary i use an adhesive for fragile skin and many of the adhesive borders already in place end up damageing my skin
these makeup remover pads are nice because they have a white side and a black side the black side is best for removing makeup and the white side is best for applying toner or whatever you use i have other white ones that are totally stained with makeup even after being washed a dozen times they are made of 70 bamboo and 30 cotton and come with a bag to wash make sure you tie that bag tight before machine washing or you will be spilling cotton pads everywhere i did notice that the panda on the front of the packaging is the exact same logo as the wwf panda named chi chi and im sure that panda logo has a copyright
works well does what is says and helps keep you feeling clean an dry
i needed something to keep my medical stuff in at home  this is holding 2 bp machines o2 meter glucometer in the outer pockets plus a few other things  i like to be organized and have like things together  im happy that all my medical equipment is together in one bag
i love these very clean eating and easy to transport because they do not melt in the heat i carry one with me at all times
if you need noise cancellation dont waste money in this the silicone plugs well you can hear the same having them on or not how it is even possible it doesnt matter the shapes colors nada having this things in the ear canal is like having earwax but you can still hear with this ones insidethe waxy stuff almost the same as the regular foamy onesi will keep trying to find some noise cancellation earplugs
i have alot of black hate those little fuzz balls and an a animal that sheds constantly i do love my dog lol  i have used lint rollers also the little gagets that are battery operated takes forever and really doesnt do the trickthis is great for heavy material like hoodies sweatshirts and leggings  i wouldnt recommend on material that snags best lint and little fuzz removal but the trick for me hold the material taunt
ive tried laser treatment on my legs recently so i had to shave my legs with razor few days later new hairs showed up they were not too long for waxing treatment thats why ive decided to try an epilator honestly i was very skeptical because i couldnt believe that epilator can catch such small hairs but it did i will post before and after pictures so you can see how clear my leg was after using this epilator just for a few seconds it removed my short hairs with the roots im impressed definitely will be using it it is lightweight so i will be taking it with me when traveling
very clingy truly grabs onto whatever it is being wrapped aroundonto including itself be carefulthe material is thin i have used other compostable cling wrap and this is the thinnest i have usedcomes with a slider cutter that you have to attach to box for use in cutting sheets of wrapa little tricky to dispense  cut  once i got a piece off the roll i was able to effectively wrap some food it was while it is still on the roll and trying to get some off that is slightly problematic for me perhaps with more use i will get the hand of it if you can get a whole sheet off then know that whatever you wrap this will provide a good seali find that the compostable wrap is much more clingy than regular cling wraps and for that i will likely continue with buying compostable cling wrap this is about what i expected and works pretty well however  i prefer this brand httpswwwamazoncomdpb08xvswfz2more pricy though354 stars
its ok it works alright but it is not powerful at all  that part of the description is deceiving
these are very good shoe insert insoles i have small narrow feet and i was able to place these inside my flats with no issue i did have to cut the inserts to fit correctly in my shoes but other than that they are very comfortable and keep my heels from hurting as they did before they provide the perfect amount of cushion in my shoes without making them feel funny on my feet it was very hard trying to shape with scissors so that it didnt hurt the area under my toes but in the end it worked out overall great insoles and great size after adjustment cuttingi received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
bought this more for the scent profile than the germ fighter aspect i saw that it was fine for use around pets when used as directed which is also why i was keen on getting it i have 2 labs and 3 cats so it is important that i use products that are not going to harm them i like freshening up my carpet so i figured i would give this a tryfor pet owners  sprinkle on carpets wait 15 minutes vacuum then keep pets off of carpet for an additional 30 minutes after that i didnt realize that second part is needed until i read the directions i failed to see that when i was looking at the product description it is there so just know to add in the additional timeit smells really good very fine particulates be sure to follow directions with pets for added precaution i am using this in  areas that are well ventilated and not in direct sleeping spots
time will tell on the effectiveness but as of now not much difference in how i feel
i think that it helps my sleep and cools my body temperature down
seems to be helping so far
i only use this on my face
i used to love these energy drinks and have used them for years but i do not see myself repurchasing in the future they recently changed the formula and the flavor  i dont mind the flavor change even though it is not as good as it used to be  but the main difference is that these do not work the same for me as the original formula  from what i can tell they halved the amount of 34spike formula34 in the ingredients and changed around the order of the 34other ingredients34  it doesnt really matter since whatever they did it is not as effective now as it used to be which is a shame
so thick that it is unusable for me nothing like muro 128
i purchased the lavender scented spray and am delighted with the results i did a deepclean on my mat by spraying it down and letting it sit for 2 minutes then wiped it down with the microfiber cloth and let it sit dry overnight before rerolling the scent is pleasing and leaves the mat smelling fresh for a couple weeks if you are sensitive to scents i would purchase the unscented version easy to use and the ingredients are safe this bottle will last you a long time even with daily use
i already have previous sport elite model and got one because of new tens added it is a great function and i expect the best great service from the buyer and good price thanks
i dont know how anyone who gave this a positive review was able to insert them into the ear at all the material is very flimsy and they collapse at the slightest amount of pressure after 30 minutes of fumbling i gave them to the flight attendant to put in the garbage theyre worthless stick with the putty type which always stay in place and block all sound the only reason i tried them was that theyre in a smaller case than what i currently use caveat emptor
received items in crushed box all tissue boxes inside crushed still usable too much trouble to return very disappointed in packaging
theses pills work very well to help with my inflammationi did have an issue when i opened the package some got on my quartz countertop and it seemed like it was going to stain it but since it was quartz i was able to remove it had the countertop been granite it might have stained iti have also noticed that my urine is more yellow after taking these than any other turmeric pillspills are easy to swallow without any after taste
sometimes these things are good sometimes there not its always hit or miss when ordering these rollers
this machine is a good foot spa but it is a bit small for my taste i am a man and men tend to sit with their legs slightly apart if that is the case with you this unit will become annoyingly small after using it for a while
very good quality scale
i completed the full bottle of pills and my conclusion is that this product did nothing i consider myself a biohacker and i am in tune with how my body responds perhaps the effect is masked by all the other supplements and peptides i take i tried to isolate the effect from my other supplements and energy drinks i tried taking more than the recommended dose taking it spread throughout the day taking it in the evening in addition to recommended three pills at onceif this supplement does anything it is too subtle for me to notice some supplements and medications take time to build up before their effect becomes noticeable but i did not notice anything from this at any time during the month i was hoping this would work since the company seems wellintentioned with a belief that what they are selling worksthis is clearly not a stimulant anything that is a stimulant is more immediately effective than this productthe clinical trials are meaningless if they used a placebo as a comparison they should be comparing competing products such as caffeine adderall ritalin and modafinil all of these competing drugs are less expensive than this supplement excluding the cost of the doctors visit to get the prescription the real challenge for supplements like these is how it stacks up against caffeine or a monster energy drink not a sugar pillpeople that are avoiding stimulants are not going to eat cocoons either products like this target the fringe of biohackers who already take numerous other supplements and are not nutrient deficient in anything the target audience is different from a clinical trial groupthe main compound adding to the cost is the peptide for brainenhancing peptides semax and cerebrolysin are established proven and scientifically validated peptides and both work great in me and have noticeable effects i am not sure what cocoon peptide is supposed to do and the web site of the vendor does not mention how it works what is the mechanism of action the other peptides i mentioned increase bdnf levels and are less expensive than this producti am a man in my 40s and i have tried a large number of supplements nootropics medications and peptides to help increase productivity focus and mental performancethe moneybackguarantee helps for a product like this but it seems like you will need to take a test at the start of the 30 days to activate the offer
this slip resistant tray worked wonders while my boyfriend had knee surgery now my dad uses it as a lap tray
great samples from great companies  love it
i am very happy with the small size of these capsules the extra fruit and veggies added into my day to day is fantastic i was nervous they would be too big especially since these capsules always float and mess with my headability to swallow pills but they really are great
works great easy to set up its perfect
it worked really great and you can see the screen very clearly thats what got me was the brightness and clarity of the led screen i also like that it has usbc and it comes with a bag too nice
the orings wont stay on my glasses which defeats the purpose of using them tossed them out
love the color and beads at the end i use them to store my jewelry and the bags are durable
this is a great supplement for lowering blood sugar and aiding digestion you dont need to go to strange lengths to take it its not meant to taste like fruit you dont need to hide it in smoothies or soup just add 14 tsp of this into a small cup of warm water 2 times a day and drink its not going to taste delicious but its really just like a slightly bitter tea if youre used to herbal remedies you wont be phased by this if youre used to gummy vitamins you probably wont like it
these are very tasty
i bought these to help make stacked cakes these did the job well
i put it on and have not taken it off love this
fantastic upscale great packaging great instructing well made silicon with 2 stoppers one w elongated loop and one flat insert nice cover microwavable and they stay warm best of all is the modest size perfect for so many applications i bought 2 and prefer these to all others im going to give the plastic set to the pets for warmth these surpass all other hot water bottles and what a bargain price for the high end product

what i dislike is that the balls have to be charged after every washing there is no scent and its good for sensitive skin the freshness is there but only after the balls have been sanitized in direct sunlight also it really doesnt kill odors as strongly as i would have liked
i dont know what it is but it seems like he is not real i dont like it
solimo petroleum jelly white petrolatum skin protectant soothes and protects skin by creating a protective moisture barrier helps provide relief for dry skin and helps protect minor burns wind burn and chapping
item arrived exactly as described this is a highquality item that is definitely reusable for multiple occasions i used this as a backdrop along with some other wall decorations
i appreciate the price as well as the product and i continue to come back to it each time i run out
this product did not work could not get it to turn on cheaply made
i am in no way skilled at using a curling iron with that said after getting used to the longer barrel it was surprisingly easy to get nicer looking waves and curls where i want them my hair is naturally curly with a lot of body but my natural curls are unruly this has helped tamed my usual nightmare and i love the results this iron is value priced and i hope it holds up well enjoying thus so far
i have a couple of shoes that rub bunions  it works as advertised  i have also used it to keep sticky zippers working
im used to the crappy foam earplugs for everything and these are my first earplugs of this kind wow what a difference this reduces the overall noise level to protect your hearing yet you can still hear with enough definition to have a conversation with someone and understand what they are saying assuming theyre speaking loudly of course with the other kind everything sounds muffled so you cant really do that added bonus these are so comfortable ive never worn earplugs as comfortable as these theres no pressure or ear ache at all best earplugs ive ever used no wonder they have a special little carrying case
i really like this brush for my dog the handle is very comfortable to hold i was using a toddler size toothbrush on my dog but this toothbrush is so much easier to hold and makes cleaning my dogs teeth a little bit easier
this stuff is good it makes my contacts feel more comfortable and certainly keeps them cleaner but this stuff is so damned expensive it probably cost pennies to make and they run up the price because they have market share with the way you have to use the product you run out of it super quickly and realize youve just blown 15 on a few weeks worth of contact cleaner crazy
not as good as an alcohol based cleaner 420 cleaner better 10x
will not stay in place on back on chair
excellent product just what i needed petroleum jelly
works when in but not great as goes off tooquickly
works really well
i used to have one of these mops when they first came out it was one of the as seen on tv versions this is the best mop hands down it literally picks up every micro dust of hair or debris that is on your floor if you have pets or get a lot of dust in your area this is definitely the mop you want to have
while installing this generally involves finding the right spot in your ducting especially if you have a humidifier cutting a hole and wiring it up its easier said than done  you likely will need a drill dremel andor snips and most folks dont mess with their ducting much the video provided by the vendor is a bit misleading as you generally cannot just drill through drywall to install  if you know someone who does itll likely be easy for them  the brightness of the bulbs makes it hard to qc things as you cannot easily tell theyre on without being blinded by severely unhealthy light  i actually had welders goggles handy which helped a lot  the unit does have indicators on the outside but if you want to verify things while setting it all up be carefulin the end it all works  it was easier to install than a whole home humidifier but more difficult than many home improvement projects
they are helping especially with crampsin my feet
been diagnosed with gastritiscolitis and use for those issues wow im impressed every day im a little less severe they had me on famotidine for over a year and this did more for me than that in 1 week note i take 5 pellets
its perfect i love it  its sturdy and very good looking i had bought a very inexpensive folding cane that was noisy
im kind of between a 6 and a 6 12 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose  these pads help with the 6 12 for the ones that are a little loose adds a bit more comfort for long wear
i am pleased with this sensitive toothpaste i have been using it for the past week and it has kept my sensitive teeth feeling good it has a nice flavor not as minty as my previous sensitive toothpaste but very pleasant and light it foams nicely without being too foamy i have not had any pain in my teeth since i began using it i already used a sensitive toothpaste before this one however switching over has not caused me any problems i like the consistency of the toothpaste it is a normal toothpaste consistency and is not watery at all

it is difficult to keep your teeth dry to put on the whitener
velcro is very itchy and irritating for clientsbuy the drawstring type sooo much better  jmt beauty soft black french terrycloth spa wrap w drawstring  stopper
this stuff is delicious i dont know why every shake powder has to be chocolate vanilla or berry or those hypersweetened flavors so this one is a great option if you just want a tasty shake that tastes like oatmeal delicious i wish the carbs were lower but i mitigate that by using unsweetened  flax  soy  almond milk or a green juice spinach lemon apple carrot and it makes it very balanced
perfect product for what we needed them for i scooped ice cream into each one fed a straw and a spoon into the slot of each lid and put them all in the freezerat party time we scooped ice into the tub i had them in everyone could choose their own flavor soda to pour over the ice cream in their cup and each person got to have an easy no mess ice cream soda it couldnt have worked better thanksmy only complaint is that the lids stuck together really badly and took me forever to separate some of them
mediocre sallys has stronger files will stick to those
i am using this powder on my dog  its a great product  it helped heal his wound  but my vet warned me about using it on him if he licks an area  the zinc in the product is toxic to dogs  so i stopped using it because he is always licking on the wounded area
lots of dental floss so i wont have to order it again in the near future also prime free two day shipping to my front door what more could you ask for the floss is fairly thin which i wanted so i could floss in between a  couple really tight teeth i have the flavor is subtle mint and at 55 yards one container has plenty of floss to last two months by those calculations this order should cover one person for an entire year of daily flossing using just under 3 feet of floss each time
this is an easy way to get the b12 taken but be very sure you realize that it contains fifty thousand percent of the daily suggested need this could cause a problem
im pregnant and have an indoor cat her litter tray is in our small bathroom i needed something to aid in cleaning bacteria in the air after 2 days using this device it appears to be working well in our bathroom over the kitty litter within 6 hours you could tell it has cleaned the stale air scooping the poop out of the kitty litter as quickly as possible and flushing it is advisable i like the devise but will also continue to clean the bathroom with bleach as well
i thought these might be heavy and that the edges of the rings would be scratch but neither is the case it lis wellmade and lays very lightly on my neck nor does it pull down hanging it places my glasses mibreastbone which is remarkably comfortable for me i also bought the hearts but havent worn those yet
i liove this oil i use it daily on my face i mix my favorite essential oils in with it it absorbs quickly and leaves my face so soft i use a combo of this and pomegranate seed oil no more expensive day or night creams for meand ive gotten compliments on how nice my skin looks
it is an easy way to ingest superfood and i use this with my smoothie  i kinda throw in a lot of super food related powder in my smoothies  with regards with this product  it does not have a strong over riding flavor  which is great as i prefer to taste the fruitsvegetables  this is a great supplement if you are working out a lot as it is hard to replace nutrients lost from ordinary food without adding a lot of calorieslove that it is fresh and sealed well to keep the product fresh  i would buy this product again
i love vital proteins so when i saw that they came out with a collagen whey i had to have it i ordered the banana cinnamon and vanilla flavor and i was so excited to try it right away when it arrived the taste and the texture of this new product is almost unbearable i used the suggested serving size with the appropriate amount of liquid and it tastes so watered down and gritty i have to take it in several shots to finish it in the future i will stick to the original nonflavored collegen protein it was worth a try but definitely not what i expected
why not eat the super fruit itself
really like the double compartments  i wish it wasnt quite as deep as i cut tiny oblong pills and its hard to get it situated in the groove with that depth
cats in the microwave  cats in the fridge got this as a joke because it turns out my real cat is terrified of a hot water bottle jokingly got this as a maybe if he thinks its another cat it will be ok turned out to be non scary to real cats and the cutest hot water bottle imaginable
i have very sensitive skin and a lot of things irritate it so im always worried when i try something new i spot test and wait spot test and wait this product doesnt irritate my skin first winning feature its a milky toner which made me wonder but its moisturizing and balancing it feels nice allows me to skip additional moisturizing normal combination skin and leaves my skin clear and bright love this product and will buy more when this bottle is used up absolutely no irritation
i have worn these for years and am finally taking the time to write a review my podiatrist recommended them as a first step in treating a nasty case of plantar fasciitis that i acquired from running around barefoot for a production i also work as a nurse and am on my feet for 12 hours walking an average of 10000 steps or more at work these were a miracle it took time for the plantar fasciitis to heal but these accelerated that process if i wear shoes without them or run around the house too long barefoot it tries to flare again if i behave myself and wear these in my shoes i am completely pain free  ive learned my lesson the hard way
the nipple suckers do not work well at all the syringe is not strong or long enough to get the suction needed for those with truly inverted nipplesthe nipple correctors work but the surface area is way too large and definitely intended for someone with big nipples if your nipples are smaller itll hurt a lot more than necessaryid only recommend the nipple correctors and only for those with large nipples id say honestly to look for another brand myself i wasnt too impressed
got these for my sister who relies on those cheapo dollar store things and youd have thought i sent her a bad of gold her reaction was so great on these  she says they are super well built and optically obviously superior over what shes been using  and has had a couple of compliments on the way they look too
purchased for my grandkids and they they elderberry syrup year round they stay pretty healthy too
great extra grainy will file thick nails no need for extra pressure on thin nails or even thick very durable files
did absolutely nothing for me  wouldnt stay on my foot  returned
i consulted with my internist and endocrinologist before i started taking this i was very happy that they thought adding this supplement to my daily regimen would be greatly beneficial to my health this supplement is a well balanced mix of essential vitamins and minerals that helps with the quality of my health and immune system i am in my mid thirties and i am noticing that the overall quality of my health and well being is just not the same anymore to make things worse i have several health conditions that i have been suffering from for years now i started taking this supplement together with other natural vitamins that complement its benefits it is made from superior ingredients and in my opinion it is well priced two thumbs up for this brandi received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes regardless i only recommend products or services i use personally and believe will be good for others i refuse to review or endorse products that i have not or will not personally try needless to say i may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things i say on my reviews are made up or fake  they are all based on my experiences with whatever product i am reviewing im just a regular consumer and i appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying my views and opinions are from a customerend users standpoint
if you buy empty capsules you can make your own capsules to swallow and save yourself the bitterness of this powder i do not plan on purchasing capsules so i will mix with my manuka honey and water and drink it down this is supposed to be great and i am going to believe in that as i drink each glass
have not used that much and went to use it today and it gave an error which i think is associated with the band not inflating
3 stars for whitening  i only used it twice and not sure yetit does however have a very minty sent  love that it comes with 2 me and my husband are giving it  a try update a month later i have not used it continuously so i cant say but even just the 1 time using it it works decent i have to say i was pretty suprised
i bought this as an xmas gift for my girlfriend  she loves it  its tracking her her young son and myself now and we have it tied into each of our fitbit accounts  i also tricked my mother and sister into buying one for each other for xmas  hopefully this will inspire them to take charge of their fitness moving forward
i use baby oil mainly to remove eye make up it is less expensive  does a better job than the make up wipes ive tried this also works well as a body moisturizer when applied after bathing will definitely buy again
works well great price i am a nurse practitioner and this is easy to use and accurate i recommend for anyone who needs to monitor their bp
amazing absorption yet very gentle on painful wounds
love these pads help with pain on knees and hips
it works fine when your banana fits but beware that the ribs do not allow it to flex more than a few degrees contrary to what i assumed from the photos so if your bananas curvature doesnt fit the narrow limits of the molded shape you are out of luck also really long bananas will not fitone thing that is not apparent from the photo is that both ends are open which is a good thing for airflow and to let the stem stick out saving internal space
i thought these caps would be a soft silicone that would stretch to fit over the heel but theyre hard plastic and were way too big for my stiletto on my wedding day my bridesmaids had to wrap my heels in toilet paper to wedge these caps onto the shoe they might fit a thicker pump style heel but they are far from a universal fit
ive always made it a point to clean my dogs teeth since its good for them and dental cleanings are very expensive ive used dog toothbrushes and finger cloth brushes before but never a dual silicone finger setup like this i never cleaned the inside of the teeth but only the outer sides the dual finger brush does make it easier to clean the inside teeth and fortunately my dog is use to me having my fingers in her mouth im sure this might not work for many but it does work okay for me and my situation
been on this one week i think i need to be on it longer to see results but i dont feel as tired  im taking this as a result of dr recommendation
these generic oral b compatible toothbrush replacement heads  4 brushes are good replacement toothbrush heads for the oralb battery operated toothbrush  i like them  good price
this product may be good for you but boy is it gross i usually have to mix it with some sort of juice to try and dilute it
works in a pinch
wonderful way to store multiple brushes  i wonder if they have a stand like this for dese razors
we like that it came with a glove to protect your hand from getting burned  it does warm up fairly quickmy daughter has long thick hair which made it time consuming to use this because we were worried about burning her hair if we kept it on one spot too long  you have to use it in very small sections of thin layers  the swivel cord made it easy to just angle and brush where she needed itoverall it works
they are a ok replacement in a pinch
had this for almost a month and is holding up great its stays put and has little ridges that help you not slip would be great for someone who is elderly for that reason and it looks very spalike as well
so i started using this benecol today  i will post update on my numbers in a few weeksbtw  great packing  arrived well packed in a small cooler with cold packs despite the temperature outside being in the 50s  appreciate the thoughtful packing
did not work for me and would make my heart race out of nowhere thats unusual because ive taken many diet pills in the past including ephedra and never had that problem once i discontinued use my heart stopped racing
i really liked this whole set i was out of helium so that was no fun i was only able to use a few of the balloons i couldnt get enough helium in the confetti filled balloons to get it to float it sank so it was just sitting on the table all in all the banner itself was totally worth it it was easy to thread the letters on to the string with the needle tool
i think these detergent sheets would be great for kids living in dorms at school or when you are taking lengthy trips somewhere but for home use id rather have my big jug of liquid laundry detergent  ive used several of these and they seem to clean clothes just fine and dont leave any perfume scent behind on them  however i have to use 3 sheets at a time since my laundry loads are big  at that rate i only get about 10 or 11 loads done and that just isnt all the economical since one box costs 1059  i can get a big jug of liquid for about that much money  all that said these clean fine are easy to carry especially good for those who cant carry much stuff and dont leave a perfume scent behind  these would be great for those with a very limited storage space in their laundry area
didnt bring back the black and remove scuff marks as well as i expected
quite an advantage when sitting for a prolonged period on hard surfaces not really 34soft34 but adds a lot of comfort as your weight seems more distributed and hence the 34nopressure34  it is very portable and works on many surfaces my wife sits on it when on a soft sofa and has significantly less lumbar pain  i have been using 2 different types of the horseshoe shaped chair cushions with the sacral cutouts for about 1 year  and find these to be amazing when sitting for long periods on a wooden chair but they are more rigid and do not quite distribute pressure like the purple to be honest i put the purple pad on the chair then the anatomically shaped butt cushion and together they are the ideal solution most comfortable sitting arrangement i have found ever
setup was a bit challenging but once i got past that i have loved this scale  it syncs without fail more reliably than my fitbit tracker and has held up fine despite occasionally being knocked over  it has traveled 1200 miles in the trunk of my car when i wanted to take it on a monthlong trip and is still no worse for wear  im not sure if the body fat percentage is accurate but the weight seems to be  another bonus is that this automatically updates on my fitness pal once it syncs
oh my on all things holy get thesethese are amazing i took a big whiff of the bag and it allowed me to breath better already but once you put it in your shower  i swear its like baby jesus himself came to rid me of my allergies  i can breathe yall i can really breathe
tangles after a while
i consume this cod liver for the vitamins a and d and the omega3 this batch wasnt as smelly as the first or im getting used to the fishy smell i still season the liver with a bit of lemon juice or vinegar to kill the smell even more bottom line nutritious seafood without the bones
very fast deliverystrong and durable at 4 mils not too thin and not too thick i am using these to organize my many jewelry beads and stones most of which are still in the mailers i expect to reduce my storage needs significantly
good product fast delivery
i have tried a few similar silicone face mask brackets and i feel that these really are the best what makes them stand apart from the rest is the silicone strap basically you are wearing 2 separate things  the bracket and your mask after nearly a year of wearing masks i have found these to be the most helpful when it comes to preventing my glasses to fog up the silicone is very soft and nonirritating the storage cases are an added bonus in my opinion love these
works ok maybe not as well as a cyptic pencil but also doesnt leave a black mark
meh it does the job ok but you have to clean it after every swipe and it gets tedious
i have used this brand and liked it for a long time  this purchase is because i can not get the large quanity refills a local stores
this toothpaste has an interest flavor never had a lemon mint toothpaste and its not bad it will probably grow on me more too one of the main reasons why i got this toothpaste was because the ingredients seemed better than conventional toothpaste although i didnt realize it contained silica never heard of it before either so i looked put up to see what it was i guess it is ok to use but i also read it could wear down your enamel so i dont think im going to be using this regularly just in case i may use it weekly or even biweekly the toothpaste doesnt foam up much which some people may not like besides the silica concern i like the toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean
very comfortable and has made my longer driving trips longer than 45 minutes much more tolerable arrived quickly this device really works
i hats flouride i go well out of my way to find flouride free products this is the best one so far it whitens like a lot of the other tooth pasted cant  it is travel size but a little goes a long way
this is colorful and lightweight keeps the sun off of my facei used some iron on hem tape to make it a bit smaller
my wife loves this
full disclosure yes im a very tall and heavy guy so this review may not apply to a lot of people  on the other hand im within the advertised rating for weight for this stool and my disability makes it a necessity to get around in my kitcheni had high hopes for this product  the same feature thick seat padding that makes this uncomfortable for me after prolonged use is also what makes it durable for my weightso thats an even trade  after all its a stool and not a recliner  im good with thatwhat im not happy about is that after just over two months of using for about 40 minutes a day a wheel fell off this morning and wouldnt snap back in again  then i was surprised to see that the sockets for the wheels to snap into are just molded plastic  one of the edges of that failed wheel socket had cracked  what a poor designgoing cheap like that instead of a few pennies to put metal inserts into the plasticive poured a bunch of thick super glue into the socket to see if that will work as a temporary fix until a new one can get here  yes im taking a chance on another one of the same type but i cant keep paying about 75 every two months to buy stools that i really need to have to lead a fairly normal life
this scale generally works okay but it seems to have a weird memory function for example ill take my weight and it will jump around pretty dramatically before jumping to a number then if i step on it again itll immediately go back to that same number as if it has a memory function in it then just to test it ill grab something else about a pound or so just to test it and itll still immediately jump to that same number this obviously makes me not trust the numbers
so far it is the best quality on the market for such affordable price i have combination acneprone skin and this has been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine i use it twice a day once in the evening when i shower also make sure you use the sponge everyday and keep it kind of wet so it will not dry and will last much longer i simply love it it has really made a difference in helping clear up my skin and keep it clear i love that it exfoliates without being harsh and i love that the sponge itself lasts for so long ive had mine for almost 2 weeks now and i will probably replace in a month or so i highly recommend giving this a try it has really helped me
cute but a bit misleading colors were onpoint size was not instructions were nonexisting
super cute bags i bought them for my med school friends graduation party and they were a hit they didnt lookfeel cheap or tacky and were the perfect size to fit some candies bandaids and bone shaped pens
seem to have a little more energy feel a little better maintain weight through christmas
perfect for the barber shop 
ive used it for many years but a few years ago it disappeared from the drug store  grocery shelves  i dont know why but amazon continued to carry it  this last shipment came from india the cardboard boxes were all crushed but the tubes were just fine
th scouring pads are basically the same pads i usually buy i use them till they fall apart which takes about couple of months and i wash dishes very often new these seem fine scrub well leave dishes and surfaces clean it works for me
this 5 piece eye make up took kit is actually pretty nice the container it comes in is kind of just plain would love to see a design on it but the brushes work really welli tried out each brush and none of the bristles fell out they seem to be pretty durable strong and made of good quality materialthese would make a great little gift to your wedding party girls give one set out to each of the girls in your wedding party these would also be great for holiday present or birthday present wrap a nice little bow on it dress up the container with sequins overall i would say this brush set is a good quality product for the pricei received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review
after using the sponge for a couple weeks i can honestly say its one of those things that i didnt know i needed its really gentle on my skin and i love using it with my simple cleaner i was a little thrown off by the way it arrives it waschard textured like a rock but after running it under water it became very soft and luxurious feeling
i got a very strange email following this order makes me question product quality and security as far price goes if ingredients are as stated 90 for the price is good
very cheap for a 3 pack and the color is great but thats because of babylips
i tried several kinds all homeopathic nasal spray for sinus  this is probably second fav works good but best one is seagate olive relief for me
just what i needed for my bottles with squeez topswatch some of the videos where a lady has rearranged the slots to meet her needs way cooli got the finished box but i almost wish id hotter it unfinished i dont like the smell and im afraid that once my oils are in it that smell will mix badly maybe ill just set it out with the lid open for a week
unfortunately this mostly just pushes dust around very little clings to the brush i thought after washing it maybe it would be activated but still no i should have returned this when i had the chance now im stuck with itwould not recommend
they dont have alot of peanut butter flavor but theyre tasty considering the carb count and the amount of protein i definitely would buy them again perhaps the lemon bar flavor they have a good lemon taste
this is a good selection of balloons for a graduation party i loved the confetti filled ones the numbers are huge but one of the four numbers had a leak in it from the getgo we taped it up but it was never as full as the other ones
since a relative had a knee replacement weve tried 2 brands of ice bags and 3 brands of cold packs to keep her swelling under control she prefers this ice bag at night because it gets the coldest and conforms to her knee the best get the 11inch bag for knees youll need the extra width once the ice bag is full the 3inch wide opening on this bag enables you to include larger ice chunks instead of having to hammer ice into tiny chunks to get them to fit be sure to dry the threads of the ice cap on the bag and cap before and after use i had leaking from another brand of ice bag after shreds of ice got caught in the threads when i screwed the cap on the leaking stopped with that bag and ive never had leaking with this bag when i kept everything dry
originally purchased for travelling easy to pack and takes up little space had some left and started using on a regular basis does a great job takes up far less space in my tiny laundry room than those big tubs of detergent never makes a mess  what more can i ask for
ugly colors
i purchased wrong size but item was good
this thing actually works i was skeptical at first but i am now a believer cool to the touch and you can set how hot you want it to be on your hair works on all hair types and so much easier than a flat iron straightens the hair without taking away its volume
due to extreme lymphedema i need to almost constantly have my legs ankles and feet wrapped but the ace bandages would bother my skin especially since its dry and the warmer weather was coming and we had days that i was sweating so much it was suggested to me to purchase these and we would use them as a barrier between my skin and the ace bandages well it worked quite well i would have the nurse or the aide depending on whos day it was here to wrap as suggested and sure enough it not only stopped that feeling of sweating but also the little breaks in skin i had got a chance to heal and by using lotion first and then sealing it in with the clean wraps it helped my skin to absorb and become softer smoother and healthier i highly recommend these
i dont know why i keep selecting these weird powders when they appear on my list of items i can review  i really cant tell if they have any positive or negative effects on me after consuming  i assume they are healthy in some way so i dutifully add a spoonful or two to of them to my daily smoothies  i cant even detect that the astragalus powder is in my smoothie because it blends in smoothly with everything else and i cant taste it  i guess if you are interested in astragalus powder you already know why you want it  ill just tell you it tastes fine and mixes well
we liked it was easy to scrape the plates off
i use zip lock all the time and i like these because they had texans on them
now sure what theyre talking about warmth  i love this flosser  it has different setting i use soft which is still pretty strong  the water pulsates through and you have to be careful with how wide your mouth is open or water gets everywhere  definitely makes me want to use it  only drawback is where the buttons are placed ive accidentally turned it on a few times and water sprayed all over the place  the water tank holds enough for two uses but the charger lasts forever
i got this drpedi kinesiology tape bulk muscle tape for my wife and i  we have both been sidelined for several months she severely broke her foot back in november 2020 and i hang a torn hamstring and then last month surgery for another issue i knew wed be needing tape as we were allowed to get back into working out primarily i had wanted something for her  this foot break was so bad she was literally off it for 5 months  no weight and she loves working out so i thought having tape would help give her support  and confidence  as she returns she was finally cleared and has been very slow in building back up what shes allowed to do today she finally was able to jump rope and put enough pressure on it to require the support shes very happy with the drpedi kinesiology tape bulk muscle tape first there are three roles second it comes in precut lengths which were perfect for her today she had the whole piece  she used three full stripes at points around her foot it proved excellent support and made her feel completely safe as she jumped  this is a major step forward for her after such a major break  2 bones one almost shattered so that this drpedi kinesiology tape bulk muscle tape kept her safe and secure is a good thing admittedly she literally is only just back  and im still another week from being cleared  but i am so happy she felt safe while she was out there she did not cut it down  there are the lines so she could have  but the recommendation was keep full pieces for what she needs the corners are prerounded so we are hoping it keeps the corners from peeling too quickly again this was her first time but so far we are very happy with the outcome
good for four or five cigars or 2 with a lighter
i have long thick hair having said that these things are worthless they are hard stiff plastic have no give to them i tried using them several times and couldnt get them to work at all waste of money
i went to vegas a week ago and was told to carry an amethyst for luck  this was told to me by one of those fortune telling machines that spits out a card  the amazing thing is i am an aquarius so amethyst is my lucky stone  i ordered this stone not knowing what to expect  when it came i was stunned at the beauty of the packaging and the positive energy flowing from the productthe stone is gorgeous and has so much positive auras flowing through it as i held it  it is a big stone that fits perfectly into my palm i love how it feels and how it makes me feel  i have noticed that i am more calm and more in tuned with my intuition  whenever i am upset or feel out of balance i hold the stone and everything is fine with the world again  in addition to i feel like it is my lucky stonei am glad that i ordered two stones one for myself and one for my sister who is also an aquariuswhat sets this stone apart is the vibrational energy  i have ordered stones from ebay before and none of them gave me as much positive vibes as these stones  i am so happy to have finally found someone who is selling real stones with positive energyby the way i bought a lottery ticket and won the mega ball  although it wasnt the 207 million dollar prize its a start   i believe the stone is just warming up with with luck
my family loves this game we always can squeeze in one or two games after dinner and before bed my 8 and 5 year old boys think it is so fun a great game that is entertaining for both kids and adults
these meal are great  and filling
we regret only that it is cheaper per bottle to buy a pair than three sad marketing but it is our fault for not looking more closely at the prices otherwise the product is great we purchase it regularly
this is a good multivitamin containing known vitamins that boost your immune system  it contains vitamin c elderberry echinacea vitamin e and turmeric its not known how multivitamins like this will prevent infection from coronaviruses but taking these certainly cant hurt i generally prefer gummy vitamins but these are easy to swallow recommended
i am usually in ketosis  but when i cheat i cheat and fall out with sugars and breads  i know its the worst thing i could fall out withat night after a cheat day i will wake up and have to jump out of bed to the worst calf cramps i have ever had  this magnesium is the only thing that has taken care of this issueso now the pain of cheating is only in the regular pain like weight gain guilt the three days of fasting with gross glycogen hunger pangs
dont waste you time or money on other products very effective and pet friendly i did the carpets under 2 king size beds and still have plenty left  ill be buying a second to keep 34on hand34
seriously a shoe horn  whats so special about this  first not only can you not find these in any brick and mortar store when i asked the sales people if they had a shoe horn they looked at me like i had 3 heads  thankfully i found this on amazon and i must say the is the most amazing shoe horn ever  i have used shoe horns for years and my roommate said she wanted to get one so i bought her this one  but now im buying more for friends and family members because this is such a useful and wellmade product  the handle extends to the point where i dont even have to bend over at all im 54 and the part you put your heel on is very comfortable and helps your feet slip into your shoes like butta butterlol  seriously this is an amazing product  buy it
not really sure it this item really does anything might be more of a placebo thing its not quite either you can hear it within 10 feet
great for toenails
i do have 3 sets of these a black a pink  a silver set 2 sets i have had for years decided i wanted to pick up a third set they are great for travel i have tubes of different colors for different color pallets one color tube maybe the pink set for browns for a natural look a different color tube maybe the black set for graysblack for a dramatic look i use the third tube example the gray tube for a small blush brush and maybe a smaller brow brush  eyelash comb they they perform pretty darn well for travel brushes i have been very happy with them the brushes are protected by the tubes so no bend bristles upon arrival at my destination have not had any issues with shedding either even from the 2 sets i have had for several years highly recommend
i cant believe the difference between this product and other vitamin c supplements ive been taking i had issues with my gums and an infection nothing was working to help heal after taking this liposomal vitamin c for over a week now the infection is gone i am so thankful
just what i expected
listen lets be frank it tastes yucky yes but appears to work i am very bad at being consistent in taking something that i dont really like but maca powder seems to balance the system boost energy and certainly keeps you regular as to the claims of heightened sexual appetite not so sure perhaps one has to take it a while first hint the easiest way for me to take something that reminds me of dirty chalk in my mouth is to mix it with a very hot sweetened vanilla based tea like pumpkin spice vanilla bean or even almond even a regular basic tea sweetened with a tiny splash of vanilla extract is better
i have been taking magnesium capsules for a long time and i wanted to try topical form magnesium you can feel the relaxing effect just few minutes after it is apply
this is kind of a kit   though it has an odd number of items included12  3d face bracket50  extenders2  lanyards3d face bracket  really small  might work best for kids  depends upon the size of your face  they are made in china and i can only assume they are made for smaller faces  but it can also depends upon the type of mask youre wearing if youll be able to use them  they measure 4 across by 325 tallextenders  55 long x 75 wide  these are made of hard plastic  youll find some of soft silicone   but these are hard plasticlanyards  again   odd that there are only two  they measure 135 long  for kids and smaller necks  the latches on the end are plastic and quite challenging to openwhen you add 50122  64   and at the current price of sixteen bucks   that comes out to 25 cents perpiece which is really not bad at all  one of the more affordable such items ive seenmade in china
at the current price of 3324 3499 minus 5 this is super expensive for something that can only be used as a nightlight i was unable to pair this to any bluetooth device and i tried a couple also the touch controls are quirky the timer goes off by itself with any button change the light comes on automatically sometimes and the pausemove ahead button is for show only as it does nothing there are buttons on the front of the unit and on the bottom it is impossible to read the bottom buttons this is nice as a nightlight only and is barely functional as a sound machine with only 5 sounds this is definitely not worth the current price for such a quirky and partially working sound machine
these bags are so extremely thin theyare a complete waste five bags completely shredded as i was trying to open one
this kt tape is great stays on pretty well even after a couple showers i would definitely recommend great value for the price
works like a charm  has the bottom of my feet feeling baby soft  i have  the funkiest sweatiest feet ever seen in a woman  i have tried the as seen on tv products and  slathering my feet in coconut oil and wearing socks etc to no avail  but when i found this all the other went in the trash  i have been using this product on my feet for a few weeks   after use  i apply some foot cream to smoothen my feet foot cream and this scrapper are a  good combination to have healthier looking feet soon
these nail clippers work as expected and are strong they come in a tin case with a protective foam
i have long been curious about wen but am always leery of getting locked into automatic shipments which is what happens often when ordering from tv or a website i found out that sephora now sells it so off i went to buy some i was convinced that it was the answer for my sunandcurlingirondamaged hair i bought the almond mint one there and tried it a few times quite frankly at the time i was disappointed and returned to my regular shampoo  conditioner admittedly my hair was in pretty bad shape well a few weeks ago i went to the salon and had about 8 inches cut off and i tried wen on it again and had several good hair days i became curious about this orange blossom scent which is not available at sephora so i ordered iti actually buckled down and followed directions this time it has taken some patience but i finally got the knack of how best to use it on my hair my hair is now short in back longer in front with bangs the texture is mediumfine and i have a good bit of hair so it often looks thicker than it really is humid climate plays a part in that first off 1016 pumps of this is far too much and takes forever to rinse out the magic number for me is 57 pumps secondly i use lukewarm not cold water to wash and cooler water to rinse and i do rinse well after leaving it on for the duration of my shower  this is very important as it will leave a film on my hair if i dont thirdly i massage it very well into my scalp adding a bit more water and then comb through to the endsboth the almond mint and the orange blossom work equally well so i know this orange blossom wen is the real thing my hair looks and feels better than it has in a long time it has bounce shine and holds a style beautifully i now only use a tiny bit of mousse on my bangs and spray lightly with hairspray and do not need to comb or brush for the rest of the day even in high humidity i do work outside and so the style does fall some by the end of the day but that is to be expected with an active job like mine but the damage and dryness that had been plaguing me have all but disappeared since i have been using wen when i feel it creeping back i just use the remoist mask by wen and that fixes it straight awaya note on the scent it really does not smell like orange blossoms to me but it is pleasant with a fresh floral aroma and maybe just a hint of spice i can still smell it faintly in my hair after blow drying whereas with the almond mint i cannoti am really happy with this product and do not intend to ever use anything else on my hair again
really makes a difference with how my joints feel and helps me to maintain a positive moodquality is great
just as described
always helpful
i got two packages of these for travel i was not real fond of the strong watermelon flavor  it was way too sweet for me so i ended up sending back one of the packages they do work well for sleep but if you dont like watermelon or sweet i dont recommend
so glad i found this and the price was great very happy 
taking it for cancer
works perfectlywe cant sleep without it
the lid is cracked and leaked all of the liquid out poor packing and broken lid had to throw away not happy i wouldnt recommend this product
love this makes it so easy to carry my oils with me now
good for pain
it takes a few weeks to receive this product but they are great glasses
i purchased this through a health food store  i do have a coupe of sensitive spots on my scalp and it has managed to calms those spots of my scalp  it does not take days to calm everything down it only takes seconds  i will buy this product soon  it also eases the itching of my scalp and as far as i am considered this is a miraclei did not know this product existed  i found this while searching the supplement aisles at the grocery store
the bristles are a little soft but these are awesome and work well
if you wear jewelry beware because your jewelry will get caught on this and could be damaged if you try to pull it off
these dont work at all in fact they seemed to amplify some of the sound by reverberating basslow frequency in my ears they were comfortable and soft silicone but that means nothing if they dont work for their intended purpose
pleasant peppermint scent that really works seems like a great company to work with for natural products
cant get over the taste tried mixing it in smoothies but nothing can mask the flavor tastes like grass
the product themselves seemed fine but the gift box packaging was all scratched up had to send back and order a different one its a good gift at an affordable price but my rating is cause i received a faulty one might reorder and update my review
i wish it was faster but i think i can live with this
the oviduct is very easy to use non greasy and covers the area very well plus the insects do not land on the skin that is covered with the product
best invention no more dryer sheets and paper towel rolls ever again no smoke is blown out as well which is a plus
id much prefer a smaller tablet  or even two for the same dose they are hard and large making them difficult to swallow
i ended up not not being able to take this  myoinositol is great for hashimotos  i have elevated tpo antibodies and elevated tsh  but i missed the addition of dchiro which is great for pcos  but the dchiro portion lowers cortisol and my cortisol is actually already on the low side  one needs well functioning adrenals to help with the hashimotos so it is a catch 22as a side note  cordyceps is supposed to lower tpo antibodies by 45 if that is something you needso while these capsules are easy to take and did not upset my gut i could not continue taking them
this powder is a natural herb that touts benefits to your liver including detoxification in addition its supposed to contain lots of antioxidants and antiinflamatort agents its a fine brown powder with a very slight earthy taste i tried mixing it with some iced tea and ended up with lots of clumps i think a better way to use this might be to sprinkle it on a salad or if you were actually blending a drink like a smoothie
fantastic idea but tips over very easily
i dont have this so i guess i sent it back without ever trying it sorry no review then dont even remember why
a good product with proven calming ingredients these ingredients overlap with some sleeping pills and this product can make you feel tired for many people these pills are best for after the work day is over and closer to bed timeif you are hoping for a flow state at work or an alternative to adhd drugs this product is not intended for that if that is your goal start with 200400mg of ltheanine by itself to see how far that gets you ltheanine is an inexpensive pleasant tasting powder and it will be calming without making you tiredthe price as i write this is 1serving that price is reasonable if you consider the premium ingredients like ksm66 ashwagandha you are paying for convenience by having a company blend powders and put them in a capsule people in the target market can afford 1servingthe product is made in the usa at a gmp facility
i have been buying these little guys for quite some time i love them because they are unscented and they are not huge this time when i bought them the packages are different they do not have the same plastic lid and the biggest difference is the wipes are not layered within one another so that when you pull one out the next when its ready there is no way little hands or fingers of little children are going to be able to figure out how to get the wipes out i end up pulling out wads of them i am not sure why this changed and i do not like it and i will not buy these again until i can be assured that they are layered so they come out of the container easy
i have a lot of pain in my feet and after wearing these i have a lot less pain these are very comfortable to wear and stay in place its like walking on a cloud
i really like the taste of the nectar brand this particular flavor was very tasty i mix mine with fat free milk
this facial skin scrubber is not a bad little gadget it has an easy to clean stainless steel spatula the unit has 3 different settings cleaning and moisturizing which are similar to each other and uplifting that is definitely different on how it vibrates on your skinwhen you use it it definitely feels interesting on your skin when you use the cleaning and moisturizing settings you should use a cleaning solution or moisturizing solution of sortthe facial scrubber is a nice lightweight little unit that sits comfortably in your hand it is very easy to operate and easy to use you just have to figure out which setting you want to use i really like using this it is much gentler in cleaning blackheads and such then squeezing them with your fingers or using those blackhead tools that often damage your skin and also hurt this is nice and gentle and actually feels good it is not very expensive either so a nice little investment for your skin that should be worth it
doesnt work at all save your money
i bought this shoehorn to keep in my car i have rods implanted in my spine and parkinsons with neuropathy in both feet so i cant feel my feet nor can i touch them as such i need help putting my shoes on and its surprising how many times you need to remove your shoes when you are out and about at home i use a solid one piece shoe horn 32 long which has obvious benefits but you cant exactly carry it around in your pocketthis shoehorn folds down to a reasonable 14 inches and easily fits in a jacket pocket or the back of your pants it only takes a twist of the wrist to lock or unlock the length and it is sturdy and affordable this shoehorn works well and i would definitely recommend this to others
wow i am super impressed with this shaver it works effectively to shave off my quarantine fur it was easy to use  was fully charged upon receipt i would definitely recommend this shaver to all
i love baths so i was excited to try this  its so cool to see it dissolve and make a bunch of bubbles  i really like the scent  it smells so fresh and clean because of the essential oils
good purchase
works great exactly what i was looking for easy to put together too
unlike other filters this one actually helps to reduce the amount of fog on my glasses it is hard to wear a mask if you cant see through your glasses this makes seeing easier
firm in both support and the cotton
i got these for my wife  she tells me they are easy to take but she really cant tell if they make any difference  sorry
been using for homemade ejuice for years  no issues
i dont know why i never thought about getting a pill box in the past especially since i usually grab an empty medicine bottle to carry benadryl aspirin etc when i go out of town and i always say to myself i dont want to mix my pills but i also dont want to carry multiple prescription bottles so when i was offered these for an honest review i said to myself this really makes so much sense and guess what it does lizimandu has created some beautiful pill boxes inspired by van gogh these are perfect for people who travel or who have to take medicine on a regular basis each pill box is divided into 3 compartments they are small enough to fit inside your purse travelmakeup bag or bookbag they arent that expensive and would be perfect to give as gifts the only reason i am deducting a half of star is because i believe having a removable option for the compartment would allow people to put larger pills inside perhaps having the ability to twist the compartment and remove it would have made this 5 stars
soylent meal replacement ive tried the original im not a fan of it of the flavor its kind of blah but when you add in some fruits like pineapple or blueberries are bananas it really becomes pretty good but over time you get tired of it this flavor though is really good the chocolate you dont really need any added ingredients to drink it i do a dice kind of make it a smoothie in a sense one thing i do got to say it goes by and i go through quite fast doing the measuring properly portable generator last about a week if you use it on a regular basis i really love the product i think buying the bottles is a waste of money especially if youre drinking you on a regular basis
cleans out what you dont even know is there love it
excellent for viewing photographic contact prints
this basket fit right on my dads walker he has one that has curved supports in the fromt this hit right on  i dont think it would fit walkers with straight supports
what a waste of money
i love this stuff  i have a low thyroid and use this all the time to stay 34regular34  it does taste a bit chalky if you dont mix with something  i put in my morning smoothie and blend it in and it works great
i purchased this product to use under leukotape at the recommendation of my physical therapist ive used it on my knees feet and back and found it to be tremendously helpful in supporting my joints and relieving pain
personally  i hate seeing a review for a supplement from someone who has only used it a couple of times  its not long enough to determine if it really works or if there are significant side effects  i actually took these for a full month before recording my experience  overall  it was a positive onei  have a spinal cord injury and like many wheelchair users i have a problem with muscle spasms  using a magnesium supplement has worked better than muscle relaxers and without all of the nasty side effects  this is a lower dosage than i usually use  but the absorption is better apparently because it works just as well  its also a good choice if you are starting out  its not a high enough dose to cause digestive problems
love the selection of colors and that these are all hypoallergenic perfect
hardly use it  not that great of a product
good material
because everyone is hoarding everything and apparently decided vicks will cure covid19 it wont my poor little immunocompromised kiddo was suffering with a chest coldi searched amazon and got the idea to type in chest rub and this little gem came up and while it doesnt smell like traditional vicks it smells amazing actually she loves itit leaves her skin soft i rubbit on her heart surgery scar and it is softer now we also put it on her back and feet ive barely made a dent in the jar when it wears off she brings it to me knowing it will make her feel betterwe will 100 be buying again
for me this works great and i love that its 24hr so i can get through the entire day without having to stop and remember to take another in mid day or so
brush too soft should be for children only brush head must be replaced every month not good not stated on description instructions had to be enlarged in order to read them merchandise returned  
great for whites keep them really bright with a combo oxy and bleach oxy and  bleach throw them together at once the chemicals dont agree with each other just throw oxy  the same time you use the detergent then bleach has his own separate dispenser
i use these bags all the time however after 1 or 2 uses they dont work anymore  they are especially good for strawberries
excellent product  helps reduce coughing
wonderful set sturdy and well made
this is my go to i feel like i got hit by a bus medicine i like that its a hot liquid and not a syrup that burns going down it helps me feel better and to get comfortable enough to get some sleep the taste is pleasant you cant go wrong with honey and lemon with a sore throat and congestion if they ever stop making this im gonna be in troublei love you theraflu
i use this everyday so good
seems to do a good job stopping the itch without a horrid smell
my son love it i would be again its fun excited and leaves no mess
these lip balms contain essential oils this is not disclosed in the ingredient list in the product description or in the sellers response to a question about ingredients those of us with allergies rely on this information being accurate especially when a product claims to be fragrancefree now i have to go through the hassle of returning this product when it was misrepresented on amazon
this stuff does exactly what it says it will do relieve pain and make you feel better  happy
love these they work very well to keep baby happy and regular especially as we are starting to feed baby solids
with covid eyeglasses all fogged up we purchased this  it kind of works  the process to cleanapply is much different than regular eyeglass cleaner and you spray smear it around until dry and then wipe any streaks off  the glass still fogged up from breathing but much less than untreated lenses  will keep and try again until i can figure this stuff out
first the good this product comes in a package with a roller ball in it so it is easy to apply topically the bottle is dark so it protects the oils insidenow the middling the scent is tolerable but not particularly mind blowing it doesnt last longfinally the bad i didnt notice that this blend of essential oils really did much for me it certainly didnt offer me any relief mostly because it wasnt strong enough to last for any length of time i wont be buying this product again
how did people clean walls before these the magic part of the name is more accurate than anything i can think of
these are really nice gift boxes  very fancy and can be used for any occasion  super easy to set up and the kids gold down nice  add a little tissue paper and your really ready for any small gift giving need  love the shiny color that is really suitable for any occasion
ive been using turkey tail mushroom since 2014 ever since i was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis this brand is really good just one a day for the past couple weeks has been great i dont feel as sluggish and i feel it does a great job protecting my liver
cut great so far time will tell how they last
the innate vitality krill oil looks like a good replacement for another companys krill oil that was costing me almost double i have been taking the product for almost 3 weeks now 2 capsules daily one in the morning and the other after dinner which is late usually about 8 or 830 in that time i have not experienced any aftertaste nor have i detected any scent except for a very slight one which is too be expected as all health supplements have their own unique fragrancethe jury is still out if this will help my irregular high blood pressure but i know it will take some time for my body to see the overall benefits but it seems from the research i have done that krill oil has been proven scientifically to benefit your cardiovascular system i will be ordering my next bottle shortly as they are out of stock right now and possibly go on a subscription basis if one is offered
simple but attractive  tissue paper adds a nice pop of color
i like these reading glasses a great deal for reading in reasonably good light  in dim light i need stronger magnification but for most uses these are fine  they are attractive and each pair has a carrying case but the cases are a little tight  i like this product because i like to stash reading glasses around the house and these are reasonably enough priced that i can afford several pair  all in all highly recommended
these are certainly small and lightweight but if you are traveling to a location with complimentary shampoo i recommend just using the shampoo to wash your clothes most plain shampoos work very well as a laundry soap but im not sure about the type with conditioner  i had some pretty dirty hiking clothes and the shampoo seemed to get them cleaner than this soap
i have on used two out of the box they left me very tired the next day
too grainy i had to keep stirring it to keep it from settling so i could drink it
exactly as expected i just throw it in the washer when done works well on my floors i recommend these
perfect portions for brushing teeth rinsing with mouth wash and a handy spray container for freshening up your breath as needed
works as expected no problems
smells like a new unit was installed
great product a bit expensive but works well
these make great gifts love the lavender scent and the bombs are a nice size too they last a bit and make your bath a relaxing spa the tops have little lavender buds which is a nice touch
i got this to help support my weak knee and get the benefits of the compression sleeve i didnt want to wear two separate items when everything can be had it this one item the sleeve is tight but i know thats the compression working once on its comfortable and i dont feel any discomfort wished it came in a 2pack so my legs feel balanced but happy with it giving my one weaker knee support
very easy to mix into a shake or just water  i usually mix mine into my morning glass of water  definitely noticed increased hydration
this is amazing i am a light sleeper and need white noise in order to fall asleep it is loud enough for me was a little expensive for a white noise machine but i am very glad i bought it have been using it for 6 months and is working perfectly
i cleaned all the markers that my little people did and it take a little elbow work but it works your walls and my side table in the kitchen is back to normal smells great it dont agitates my sinuses i need to get a huge tub of this stuff shines stainless steel to a sparkle on my sink just goobles up the water mineral buildup never using other stuff after this now i dont have to sand down my walls because of marker marks hope this helps someone out get this box first comes with a two different scrubbier and start getting the same stuff after that no disappointment
i used this after the cake foaming cleanser the powder doesnt come out as easily as i would like i had to rub the blobs into my toy i feel my toy is left clean and soft the ingredients are nothing more than cornstarch so its pretty overpriced but it works
either this is a bit awkward to use or im just not used to it yet since i use a shower bench its helpful to have a lower location for a shower head holder the suction cup grips the tile really well but its a bit hard to position the shower head in the holder probably because i have a fairly large shower head this product would be better suited to a small or mediumsized shower head
every thing i needed
as described  recommended seller
adorable little bundles  smelled wonderful too
love and will buy again
these smell a little fishy but other than that i am happy with these they are vegetarian friendly organic and nongmo i take spirulina for overall health they are a superfood and very nutrient dense so i take them every day the recommended dose is 6 so i split them up and take 3 in the morning and 3 at night they are easy to take and easy on the stomach and i could even take them on an empty stomach without nausea or after tasteburps
so glad i bought this  we make our own bubble solution and it is so much cheaper than even the dollar store version  the homemade stuff even works a lot better  this stuff is great for bubbles  i also found a recipe for bubble bath that i am going to try  i would recommend this because it was a great price and it works well
listen people  call your vet and ask how to use this product  i have this and our vet said use it after the special shampoo after she dries  use a little anytime you see itching massage into skin but dont use much  its not a rinse just after shampoo when wet  dont complain something doesnt work when you dont know how to use it  my dogs dermatologist  recommends this product  some people kill me because they dont think
great for little ones the color holds well and the design is cute
these are so pretty and wash up great  hand wash would surely recommend
i liked the effect from these corneacare rescue self cooling hydrogel cold compress eye cooling pads personally i preferred the cooling effect after putting them eye cooling pads in the fridge before using but i found them to be very helpful with my dry eyes and puffy eyes from allergies
i chose these cases because of the way they look and having the tools with them in the case therefore i could see my contacts through the top to my surprise the cases are not leak proof
it may be a particular brand of tennis shoe but when i walk for long periods of time in them my toes start to hurt usually it is my second toe and it hurt like it was sprained  anyway i am overweight and attributed a lot of the problem to my weight but noticed with other sneakersflip flops etc with the same distance when walking the pain didnt happen  the tennis shoes were expensive and it was too late to return them so instead of losing out on being able to wear them entirely i thought to try these  they worked and they worked well  i dont experience that same pain in my toes or when it does it is after walking over two miles and not on the first mile  a fairly inexpensive fix to the problem but next time i go to purchase new walking shoes i will try a different brand
i have these in each room because i usually have my hands full when entering a room  i dont have to get out of  to turn off the lights to go to sleep
just what i needed to balance my walking step due to one leg being slightly shorter than the other which my doctor prescribed for me perfect plus very fast shipper i am highly satisfied
i love these gel inserts as i have the double wammy of foot issues  i have heel spurs and planters fasiicitis  because of back issues i dont wear heels flats are the only way for me to roll i switch them around to different shoes  so inserts are my best friend you laugh as i make such a big deal outta inserts but there are those out there in amazon land that know what i am saying  you get 2 pairs for 599 thats a good deal
i thought it was like i had years ago but things change  i returned it not a sticky and although it worked somewhat not what i had expected
used to clean outdoor furniture cushions and it did a great job  plan to purchase again
chocolatey but not chocolate milk i despise chocolate milk flavor reminds me of the inside of a 3musketeers candy bar liquify that keep it thick and that is what it makes me think of it is really thick could easily water it down or use milk of choice or add to blender with some ice and get something that tastes much like a milk shake or frosty reminds me of a frosty when i do thatnot a low calorie food but is within the norm for drinks and powders of this ilk i love meal replacement drinks over plain protein as the added vitamins minerals and fiber make me feel better than protein alone  i make smoothies and use prefab nutrition drinks like this as a means to get something in my body when i dont feel like eating i often dont have an appetite until half way through my day but i will feel some low level hunger and i know i need something to power me through my physical work day so a simple smoothie usually works and allows me to add in other supplements such as collagen mushroom powder that being said at some point i am never quite satisfied with a liquid meal but still dont want a meal so i usually add in a few nibbles of something whether it be fruit veg cheese stick snack bar etcworks great as a snack or even as a dessertsweetened primarily with allulose and finishes with some sucralose splenda i dont really have an opinion on either sweetener i find both are very sweet without an aftertaste and i dont have digestive issues from itpack of six 32 ounce bottles which contain 4 8 ounce servings all told same as a pack of 24 bottles at 8 ounces each i like the option of it having a few servings worth in one big bottle as it cuts down on packaging but it also reduces my ability to just grab and go however they do carry these in other sizesprice per ounce is very similar to others with blood glucose support in mindi have to say i didnt know what to expect with my first sip i was impressed with taste texture and how there was no odd taste or funny after taste really quite pleasing flavor the extra thick texture makes it versatile thick makes it feel like a shake and triggers belly into thinking there is something in there but it also allows for it to be watered down some if you want something to sipim impressed and would recommend this of course take a look at ingredients and decide if it is good for your needs
my kids are super picky its like they know they are eating something for their health and immediately is bad but these are great they love eating them the flavor is not strong but enough to be tasteful for them they have a great consistency and are chewablesthey are sugar free and thats really a plusin times when health is so important this probiotics are the bestlike them
good product but wrong priceone of these at walmart is 95 cents
yosemite are high quality and have reinforcement rings for holding them against the brick pillars on our four porch
i love healthy delights chews i think they are a healthy alternative to swallowing a pill and they taste good too almost as an appetite suppresant i will always  purchase these chews when i can
my 7 year old loves this it had multiple settings and it helps him brush for a full 2 minutes
i believe this product does help the pressure in my eyes  i will continue using the product
very good quality urn easy to remove lid and it stays on tightthe map is beautiful although the reason it only has 4 stars is because across the top of my lid there is the alphabet  i dont understand it  its called a world traveler urnmy brother was a world traveler so i thought it would be great for himeverybody that sees it says why is the alphabet on the top and i really have no answerbesides that everything is as describedthx
excellent product for the price  even gave some away to fellow traveler during recent cruise
not 250 power reading glasses dont know what they are because someone has taken the size off the arm should be printed like the first pair i bought but isnt no wonder the shipment was late  i purchased these before and love them but this time they are defective scratched late and wrong power sellers quality control is very very bad
i didnt realize its going to change structure of my soup like jello and i dont like it now thinking how can i use it good things is it doesnt change a taste
i love this loofah  it is especially helpful for getting rid of dry skin in winter when im cooped up in the house with the drying furnace turned on  the length is fine for me58 and it would fit a shorter person as well
dont know how clean it makes my teeth but i love the taste of the splashin citrus i could eat it actually why not bentonite is edible and so is citrus i have tried various forms of the redmond toothpastes but i hate trying to get the last of the paste out of the plastic tube it makes me nostalgic for the good old days of the metal tubes that stay rolled when you roll them with the new plastic tubes you probably lose about 14 of the toothpaste in the tube
a lot of ribbon
very cooling and soothing but almost to the point of being too strong provides relief almost immediately
does the job
easy to take great energy without tingles jitters you easily pump for 90 mins and not know it
i love them so muchi have given some away and ordered moreboth orders came exactly the way i ordered them saturday my second orderi ordered them alone were packed 2 pks in a plastic bag with a tie and then in a strong amazon shipping bag perfect thanks for the best product everi am struggling with this diabetes and i am having gastric bypass surgery and how i eat is very important to me those bags have become a part of my daily eating regime thanks for making my life better
i really wanted to like this but i just cant it has several features that just dont work for me although it fits ok the elastic is heavy and the velcro closure is very stiff overall it is quite uncomfortable to wear the velcro if not closed very carefully catches on the wrap and already there are fabric pulls where it has snagged the wrap it is also a very thin fabric and affords no warmth when you get out of the shower also i dont find it particularly absorbent it would work i guess as a 34modesty34 coverup if you were in a public place  like the gym showers but other than that i cant say much about it thats positive sorry but this is a 2 star product for me at best
keep these in my tool box around the shop  even in my truck  handy for an assortment of uses  hold a good edge  can cut through webbing fabrics jeans thin metals and even wire in a pinch
i am thrilled with the results i have had with the jigsaw healthmagnesium wsrt not only has it lowered my bp by 40 points it has brought my sugar level down to normal levels my doctor said that if the reading continue like this she is taking me off my rxx
just what i was looking for  extras are nice too  box seems to be made well
product was not what was expected
these are great they keep pairs of socks together and reduce sorting time so far about 6 months they have been pretty durable ive purchased more to add to the household so id say they are good at least at our house
creates a good foamy lather in under a minute bristles have not fallen out and the knot is tight  initially has a musky odor and only issue would be that the handle is pretty wide i have big hands and it is a difficult to get a comfortable grip  but overall i am satisfied with the product
the smell is perfect love it i read reviews before the purchase and they were right better than ax cannot go wrong with a brand that has been around forever
i very rarely wore sneakers or athletic shoes prior to the pandemic as no matter what brand i bought dr scholls etnies reebok skechers they hurt my feet i even tried gel inserts  nothing would helpi often and with great success wore flip flops i wore them at theme parks at a racetrack running errandsbut i still craved the security of a sneakeri decided to get these and thought theyd workthe biggest issue  no guidelines to cut the insert and for what theyre charging paying customers i got a complimentary review product  that is really unacceptable even the cheap dr scholls have guidelinesas far as comfort these inserts were a tad too stiff and rough with my feet already having issues  i didnt want to wait a good two weeks to see how well they worked then again due to the pandemic  that two weeks might be months as i dont go out i mostly due curbside drivethru or delivery for what i needgiven the mixed reviews  i dont think id get these again and i would caution against anyone i personally know purchasing them
got this for my 13yr old grandsonhe carries it with him always
delicious and nutritious these help me feel better and taste fantastic pineapple flavor but not overpowering
this is my 4th or 5th pair of sleep headphones each set has been slightly different  these are the most comfortable by far  the padding around the eyes is a perfect addition  also the adjustability via the velcro type band is very helpful  my ears are low set and i have trouble getting a good fit on most headwear or glasses the system connects easily and sounds fine  i would prefer a flatter smaller speaker as these can be a little bulky feeling if you lay on them but at this price point i still love them  battery life is good too
i would love to be able to say that this helped me with stress but i cant i couldnt tell a difference i even tried some on my dog to see if it would make a difference no it did not but it didnt harm either of us maybe this isnt strong enough for me or maybe i couldnt tell a difference because of my meds
beware these came shipped fine shipping container in tacts but the  tegaderm boxes have smashed corners that look like theyve been sitting in liquid they smell like chemical i attempted to do a return and was told there are no returns on this item despite just opening the package today after receiving it 4 days agothis is a pretty expensive loss to take and if you need this for medication patches like i do its quite a bummer go somewhere else to purchase
these are great so beautiful and you can feel the quality of the grit on the files themselves ive owned quite a few brands of glass files before and im so glad i found these
doesnt stay in place and too large
this is a great way to add antioxidants to your food i prefer fresh but its not like i can find acai berries at my local grocers so this is the next best way to include them into your foods easy to use versatile  add to yogurt smoothies etc
unfortunately this flavor has milk in it disappointing but i will continue to buy the cold brew coffee flavor that tastes good  has no dairy
this is the first time that i can honestly say i couldnt wait to write a review because i am so pleased  i ordered these for my boyfriend who has an average build but is 65 and needed something to keep his medication on for psoriasis while he sleeps  the gloves at all the drug stores in our area said large but actually seemed like they were a child large  i read many reviews hoping to find something like these gloves  these gloves are awesome  they stretched perfectly and were very comfortable to wear all night although they were snug to put on the first time he said the ointment did not get wiped off of the tips of his fingers and knuckles where he needed it  i will definitely be ordering another pair  he is so happy to have a product that is actually able to give him some relief  i cant thank you enough
great for packing light
this is by far theeeeee best moisturizer i buy all that i see in the store  then i buy more my husband has severe psoriasis  this is a relief its thick but rubs in so smooth my skin is soft until the next day
too tight
best sleep aid on the market
this is initial review got this 45 days back was very easy to set up and connect with the network and the tracker however getting inconsistent results to elaborate did everything right viz place it on the hard surface keep it at the same location weighed myself keeping my feet bare and dry weighing myself  3 times at interval of one minute just to check the consistency and getting different results for weight as well as body fat  it varies by 5 to 1 pound in terms of weight and 1 in terms of body fat anyone else experiencing the same
i love trying different protein flavors to switch it up from my normal vanilla this piña colada one is definitely a new favorite the flavor is spot on and not too sweet or artificial flavored one of my favorite ways to enjoy this is mixed into some plain greek yogurt i serve myself a half cup to a full cup mix in a half to full scoop and then let it chill again a little bit before eating it completely erases any hint of whey powder and its just a nice sweet treat thats high in protein and low sugar it dissolves easily in yogurt as well as in milk when i use it for shakes i didnt experience any bloating or digestive issues highly recommend if youre looking to try new flavorhope this review is helpful
seems to be working good  helps out dry brittle hair
great product its very sturdy and the blades are sharp enough to cut without much effort a nice change from the standard cheap and flimsy little clippers
great after my foot surgery makes a difference
this is a really great first aid kit it has 250 things and thats plenty of things that i need to help take care of my family if an accident happens no one wants an accident to happen but if one does i have a kit that has everything i need and then some its great its a nice little bag all well organized and put it right where it needs to be with a nice little handle so i can carry everything when i goi really like this it has a little bit of everything to cover a little bit of everything if it happened im glad i found this kit and was able to purchase one for my familyi purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review
works great cheaper than walmart
awesome product happy customer
good product but the mattress is a bit hard for my liking so i am returning it
sticks even on greasy surface
part of the daily regimen for knee painas expected
fit perfect and you can handle hot things without a problem
this is a smart little case  it has sections and a divider to allow for separation of items which is helpful to prevent necklace chains earrings etc from getting all jumbled together  however because it does have dividers it has a bit of thickness to it  while this is a good wellmade case ill bet someone will create a jewelry organizer soon that will keep items separate without adding the extra fabric that is in this one  i also wish it came in other colors  when it comes to jewelry while traveling my preference is to have a bright color that cannot be overlooked on a dresser top or inside a hotel safe when packing to leave  how bout a bright neon greenif you find this review helpful please let me know by using the voting buttons  through the years i have relied on reviews to make smart purchases and now im trying to 34pay it forward34 by helping others with my reviews  please let me know how im doing with your vote  thanks
all the formulas are easy to use unlike other pens they arent overnight ones so you do have to time it and remember you startedresults arent mindblowing but there are results so great
very soft and holding up pretty well to washes
this thing is a godsend i was spending 100 on acupressure spa visits to lessen the pain in my neck using this the first time brought tears to me eyes because it was so damn good i was able to target the abd spot right where i needed it the most plus the heat helps wish it was more heat i also wish the handles were loops because its a tad awkward to readjust from neck to upper or lower back as you have to remove from from inside the cuffs minor thing really but being able to hang arms inside the cuffs means you get to control how mnuch pressure is applied which is the key to delviering the massage i was impressed at how well made this thing is very good stitiching and love the red glow you get from the item for the price i paid its amazing value and really does work it has helped to reduce my neck pains i use it before going to bed and wake up with much lesser pains in my neck i only wish i had bought this item sooner i wish the nodes could be spaced further apart its fixed position this thing is really meant to be used mostly on the neck but since you can move it around you can target those sore spots any where also works wonders on the lower calf not so great on lower back for me nodes too close but again simply move it around to target the spot i also wish the power cord were longer you almost need a extension cord if you want to use it where ever so keep that in mind youll need a power outlet where ever you plan to sit for the next hour
this is a rather large product but i like the shape and how it can stand up on its own on the carpet it has lights on it that fluctuate to different colors but if you are using it when you are sleeping the lights can be turned off it has several different levels of use and you can turn it on high to get the most heavy air cleaning seems to work well and its easy to remove and clean the filter
this stain remover is different than other ones ive used its like a deodorant stick style dispenser i used it on paint and fruit stains so far and it worked very well it could be used for a large variety of different stains and its easy to apply rub it on and let it sit for 15 minutes and then wash in warmhot water my kids always get all types of stains on their clothes especially white so this comes in handy a couple minutes after you apply it you could see the stain remover interact with the stain the scent is not overpowering and has a fresh smell i love that its for sensitive skin biodegradable and natural doesnt contain chemicals
i use this to wash my face with my rechargeable facial tool  after removing my makeup it is gentle smells clean doesnt strip the natural oils and has a great price point
i use this product every day
great smell and its safe for my son who had severe eczema  i get complimented all the time on how our clothes smell and its because of this and the dryer spray that method sells
this is great
good for the baby
the other brands especially the menthol ones are like hydrochloric acid up your nose with a pinch of eucalyptus they burn they dont work as well for me 4way is the best fastest acting and has the least amount of rebound superior to the oxymetazaline hcl that the more popular brand uses read your labels
theres a bunch of tiny brushes
