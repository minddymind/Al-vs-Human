these backnobbers were given as gifts to several family members  i have had one for years  they are amazing  i use it almost daily and i can travel with it  i highly recommend getting one so you can give yourself a back rub whenever you need or want for as long as you like instead of having to wait on someone else to do it for 30 seconds  buy one for anyone who has stress in their life
great make up remover smells nice
after many years on a duty belt my old mask and glove case gave up this replacement was reasonably priced and fit extra gloves and mask without issues
im very satisfied by this charger and i greatly appreciate the built in safeguards it deploys i was able to quickly weed out useless old nimh and nicd rechargeable batteries i have and refresh the good ones the charge discharge feature is phenomenal and has rejuvenated countless batteries i tossed in the drawer it works flawlessly i like the sleek look and i do believe i will buy another for my office at work i highly recommend this charger
be very careful with this product i read the reviews that said there was no bad side effects no jitters etc yesterday i took half of one pill before lunch to test and that was the worst day ive ever had i had to leave work early and spent all day in the bathroom with diarrhea i had pain every 1015 minutes in my stomach i was about to go to urgent care but the pain started to appear every half hour or so had to miss work the next dayplease be careful with these pills i am not sure what happened but it might be that i am that sensitive to caffeine and i drink soda a lot
the rabbit portion was too long for me and the vibration so strong itd make a jackhammer pleasurable not to mention it takes 3 hrs to charge but only lasts 1 hr
very nice scent and holds heat from microwave well love how soft it is
so far out of all the diabetic bags i have purchased i keep coming back to this case it fits my insulin pen my napkins when out to dinner and have a sanitary place to lay my stuff out my meter pouch alcohol wipes and needles and it fits in my purse i like it and there is a small pocket to put an ice pack if needed  i like it it so far i just purchased the sarah spunda by dittibags also sold on amazon bag to see how that will work for my diabetic needs suppose to arrive today i wanted something cute and feminine to carry my stuff but if the comments are accurate then i will be going back to this case
have not recieved this item yet but i love these batteries  they dont last as long as other batteries but it is worth recharging them when needed
super soft and a good price
i was so excited to try these i love coffee and tea so thats what i mixed them with as per the packet recommendations the flavors wereinteresting and different than i expected not bad but not exactly yummy either i think i would have to experiment to dial in what works best with which packet to really enjoy them and the price is too high for me to justify chugging them like a vitamin shot if you enjoy earthy tones in your coffee or teas then you will probably like them more than me i will fully admit i am picky i also didnt notice any immediate benefits after just 2 packages so i probably wont be buying them again
everyone that sees this on my dad just loves it
very comfortable and relievers pressure from hips and lower back
daily dose of probiotics that is the good bacteria that your body needs easy to swallow and has no noticeable taste  completely vegetarian and loaded with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium probiotic bacteria this digestive formula will balance intestinal flora and improve health and well being
love the product but my tin arrived in a dented box with no packaging inside lid of the tin was also dented disappointing i want to take the vitamins so i didnt want to have to send it back and wait for a replacement
finally i found a great heating pad this one has 6 heat settings and normally you would have to use the highest but not on this pad also the size is excellent i have been looking for one like this forever my neighbor is going to order one now as well thank you very much
these wipes are nice  thick they smell good also an the price is good im going to buy more because i always use wipes an these are close to cottonelle  huggies  wipes what i really like is that no white fuzz comes off the wipe buy these wipes
really nice and thick vg wexcellent taste i use this in all my diy projects
these pills have a pretty pungent odor but oddly i dont taste it or burp it up im pretty happy with the results im getting after taking them for about a week theyre definitely useful for flushing out the system and the ingredients seem to be of good quality id say theyre worth giving a try
the screw that holds the carbide tip is already rounded and difficult to unscrew
i put it under my sheets and i hadnt been sleeping well and i just told my husband i think theres a lot of energy in the air or something because i feel wired well the very first time i slept on it i felt the relief now im broke in and tell a small mount  however if i forget to plug it in i dont sleep wellvery noticeable im so glad i tried it
this really works
i have been using this for about 4 or 5 days and have not noticed anything but im going to give it more time im 52 and have bags under my eyes so am hoping this can help with themafter weeks of using daily i have not noticed anything
more energy kept me focused used this before workouts and work on computer
do not buy this came half empty this is a horrible deal for the price buy from someone else
what is better than some puff facial tissues when you have a sore runny nose nothing these are soft and even contain some lotion which means that hopefully you will be able to avoid that red irritated nose that often results from a bad cold the cube shaped box contains 52 soft tissues this 10 pack can be divided and used in multiple places i have a box on my desk at work one in my car and others strategically placed around my house
we purchased this for our babys room we already had one for our own bedroom and loved it totally drowns out the sounds of life outside the window and allows for a deeper sleepour baby now associates the noise machine with sleeping and her eyelids start drooping the moment we turn it onfour stars because it does seem that the noise gets softermuffled after a few months of use i thought maybe this was just me going deaf but i dont think so the new one we got for the baby is definitely louder than our old workhorse i also think the holes in the machine that are supposed to allow you to vary the volume of sound dont really do enough there is a noticeable difference in volume but not enough rangeupdated review february 2017 one of our machines has developed a truly irritating rattle it took a couple days of terrible sleep before i figured it out like another reviewer mentioned it seems better if the machine is on an angle but the rattle is so unpredictable im ordering a replacement and hoping this is just the result of years of nightly use and not some sort of manufacturing quality issue our device and the newer one we got for our daughter are identical and weve moved them around enough that we dont know which was the original anymore
this stuff works wonders 
although i havent used coppertone for years this certainly is the smell that i remember from way back when those days before an spf was listed on the bottle the days when there were billboards with the little girl with the tan line as the dog tugged on her bathing suit bottomfor nostalgia alone i would like this product the fact that it feels much better going on than i remember the old ones to be is a big plusit has an spf of 30 and since i usually use it around a pool the fact that its water resistant is also very nicejust remember to put it on as the label suggests applying at 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying after swimming or at least every 2 hours
beware these dont just fit any eyelash curler
my wife loves these tissuesso soft
if you ever have suffered from constipation then you already know that there are a lot of products available to make your bowels work easier the next morning this is the stuff that is in many of them if you need fiber you psyllium husk if you need to ease constipation you use senna

just as described very pleased
my boyfriend swears by tart cherries in any form  ive read a lot about them and sour cherry reduces inflammation and muscle soreness helps with insomnia and prevents gout a form of arthritis  inflammation is my middle name so i wanted to try this although i dont have gout i do have arthritis in various parts of my body i also have daily muscle aches and inflammation which was recently verified by a doctor yet after consuming these capsules for a couple of weeks they have had no effect either good or bad on me i should be finished with the bottle in another two weeks  the positive is that i did not have any side effects  ive used natures bounty red yeast rice and although that product worked for me to lower my cholesterol i had a permanent nasty side effect from it therefore i consider the absence of any bad effects with this supplement a big plus on the other hand ive had no reduction in soreness or inflammation so its like taking a placebo for me  it does appear this tart cherry concentrate works for some so i suggest anyone considering this give it a trydepending on how many pills are taken per day this bottle provides a 60 30 or 20 day supply the recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills per day with meals the max ive taken was 2 per dayi called natures bounty to understand why the bottle says 1000mg equivalent on the front yet the back says 250mg per capsule what the fellow say to me was that the powder is concentrated and the 250 is the weight if you were to empty the contents of the capsule however he said since it is an extract these compressed components are equivalent to 1000mg per capsule whether this is really true or not i have no ideaas for the ingredients besides the tart cherry prunus cerasus fruit extract each capsule also includes vegetable cellulose and less than 2 of silica and vegetable magnesium stearate this is suitable for vegetarians
did not stay secure on walker had to return
my husband is so tight in the pocket he squeaks when he walkshe washes and disinfects and stores plastic neti potsgreat but when i need one i just cannot bring myself to use someone elses snot washer i mean reallythis is a good deal nicer and its not going to break my bank if you are really strapped for cash there are videos on how to flush your sinuses without spending any money at all for my sensibilities this two pack is great
great stuff slept well did not wake up hung over use 14 bottle  the problem is  my roommate keeps taking them
awesome toilet paper i love charmin big rolls like this they last a while in the household
i thought it worked well in the beginning but later it failed to help with the leg cramps
cheap quality
this product was okayit does leave your skin feeling baby soft definitely recommend it to friends you still have to use an additional cream afterwards to prevent stubborn ingrowns
makes it so much easier to get around when using a walker
i really like this toothpaste you only need a little so it last a long time seems to be whitening my teeth i am allergic to sls and have had no reaction wish it was less expensive but other than that i love it
informative lightweight  sturdy
it is a fine product but a little shaky when i had to use itit needs a counter balanceweight
my husband made the mistake of thinking he didnt need to clean stainless steel bottles if he only drank water out of them he figured rinsing was good enough then he looked inside the bottle with a flash light this product saved his bottles i use it on my daughters hydroflask does a great job i wish the handle was a little longer and the brush part was a little bigger but it works
it took me a while to figure out how to really use these basically the idea is just to push in much like fingernails the problem is you have to push pretty hard and they can easily hurt you its not really easier than pushing your skin with your fingernails unfortunately i will keep trying to get better with them however if you have easily broken skin i would suggest being very very careful in attempting these
this seems identical to the name brand version but at a better price
great glasses nice style
perfect case for my pulse ox now i can keep up with it better
these are so cute and a great value for the money i have two daughters so the 4 pack is perfect  we can usually find 2 at bedtime theyre adorable and my girls love them

excellent product i have very thin sensitive skin and using band aids usually causes more damage i was getting desperate when i saw these i had to use them this week and they are perfect for me they are truly made for sensitive skin come off easily and do no damage and they stay on until you take them off

because of the way i have my desk and computer set up i lean on my left elbow while at my computer in addition my husband does most of the driving and while in the car i tend to lean my left arm on the arm rest soon i had a problem i essentially developed a 34bed sore34 on my left elbow and no matter how many creams and tender loving care i gave it i couldnt seem to get rid of it then i found and purchased this item 2 in fact  one for desk area one for car and in no time my elbow began to clear up it took off the pressure and gave the creams and ointments time to do their work i like the idea that my arm doesnt overheat because of the mesh that keeps most of the arm cool other styles didnt have that  the pad slips around a little but not badly and easily moves back into place  i keep the computer one on a small shelf that is part of my desk and the one for the car i keep in that builtin 34sidepocket34 in the door i told my dermatologist about what i was doing and he thought it was brilliant  hope it works as well for you  if you found this helpful please click where noted below and thanks
i love them cant wait to finish my doily so i can block itmuch better than using a padded towel
these were exactly as expected  they are vitamins melt fast too
very handy for soaking my night guard
it does not work at all i wasted money
unable to use until repeatedly washed had odor
i use kinesiology tape on my bad knees and i had hoped this stuff would be a support to my back while i try to reduce my belly  yeah theres one born every minute  you get one application that is not reusable  the information says that it can be used for multiple days  i dont know how to express how dumb that statement is  pregnancy doesnt last a couple of days folks  its not a sprint its a marathon  youd need to buy these every few days at best  but if you use kinesiology tape you know that its likely to peel up or loosen well before that  so youre paying for one or two days of relief which you probably wont even getjust dont okay  get one of the ones that are reusable
i honestly thought this was the worst thing i have ever tasted it did not taste like vanilla or chai it honestly tasted like dirt i have not tried the other flavors it is a bit too expensive even for a sample pack
very nice love the moist heat need to manipulate beads into parts is only negative
i searched for a good amount of time looking for vegan gummy fiber vitamins for my 3 year old  he loves them and looks forward to eating them  he thinks they are candy
read the reviews and thought id give this a try first flavor i tried pina colada  smelled great but after the first taste i had to throw it away it left a terrible after taste thankfully the variety pack had two more flavors yup they all have weird metallic after tastes terrible would not recommend
i wasnt a fan of this because it gave me the jitters
love this product very refreshing
this is perfect for college students and anyone wanting to meal prep or store left overs i love how the containers stack together easily to keep a clean cabinet comes in a set of 30 which i will actually be using at the neck family gathering to store leftovers for guests to take home instead of using zip lock bags easy to clean and store away ive been using these for a while and they were a lifesaver in college glad i can get these in bulk here highly recommended as a warning if you do microwave pasta the sauce may stain if its tomato based i usually have designated o es just for that reason other than that its perfect to freeze and reheat your meals in
i have to say i was skeptical when i ordered this product but did so because it received great reviews  and i am here to give another one  my teeth do not whiten easily due to meds taken as a toddler nothing has worked  i have been using dreow for about 5 days and my granddaughter said 34youre teeth look so much whiter34 one day when i picked her up  thanks again  i love it
these provide some support for my bad knee but ultimately they dont have any side support to stabilize my knee these are probably better for light walking and some gentle exercise though they have compression support it doesnt prevent side twisting motion which is how i can hurt my knee i dont really think there is anything special to copper infused compression sleeves it kind of reminds me of the magnetic bracelets they sell that boast claims but have no real science behind iti received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review i am under no obligation to provide a positive review and received no incentives or rewards for doing so my goal is to highlight features and drawbacks that i would want to know about as a buyer not hype the product for the manufacturer to increase sales my remarks are sincere and true i work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item my goal is ensure that these reviews are helpful to others my opinions are my own and i thoroughly believe in keeping the integrity of amazon reviews legitimate to help the community make the best choices it is just my own opinion and experience with the product your own opinion and experience may vary i received no monetary compensation and i am not required to give a good review just looking at my public profile and you will see i dont hand out many 5 star reviews they need to be earned for me to recommend a product regardless of the price i paidkindly click yes below if you found my review helpful
as soon as we opened this product we realized just how cheaply it was made we did however attempted to use it for a week at the end of that we week we through all three of the items in the trash
works out good for me not quite the one i wanted but it will doi carry a portable tank of oxygen with me and it fits down in there perty good
work very well with my machine my old ones developed a quirk where the wire plugged into the unit now it works again the item arrived quickly which was a good thing as i really needed a dependable set of wires at the time those who use a tens unit know what i am talking about the price was super reasonable for 2 sets and they shipped free with prime
it is so rough and tore off my skin and started to bleed while i was walking had to remove it midway and it was sticking to the socks bad experience and now i have to wait for healing before i put on my shoes and these happened within 2 miles walk never buy it if you have soft skin
i like all of the egg white protein bars from julians bakery  these do have a strong cinnamon flavor if you like cinnamon  my favorite are the devils food chocolate and the glazed donut  the sunbutter is an excellent choice too
nice to have to store batteries but wish it was not all these little parts  maybe combine two together
item arrived very promptly and as described by seller
my husband bought me a pair of these i had saved to our list as some other reviewers have said they fit phenomenally i have small ears and have a difficult time finding earplugs or earbuds that fit usually they will pop out or hurt my ears these for just right and i can wear them for hours without any problems i liked mine so much i ordered these for my mom she has the same issues with earplugs and earbuds but adores these thanks so much
i purchased these to replace discolored nose pads on my old glasses nose pads absorb oil from your skin and yellow with age these are great  very soft and easy to install you will need a tiny screwdriver to install them for 2 pairs of glasses it took about 10 minutes to remove the old pads and replace them with these
3 andrews  boot waxthis stuff resurrected a pair of hiking boots that i love but that definitely had seen better days the boots were scuffed and dried out looking but now look almost new i used a rag to rub a little of the leather conditioner into the boots let it sit for a few minutes then buffed with a clean cloth the boots look darker than they did before treating them but probably like they did when they were new scuffs and scratches disappeared and the boots look incredible give it a try if you have leather you think is beyond helpyoull be surprised
this review is based on my experience so ive tried several silver lozenges and i believe the manuka honey from american biotech is the best i wish they made it with agave syrup for those watching their blood sugar just buy it already lol
my purchase arrived on time and im very happy with my product
i do like kuumba but its always a hit or miss ive purchased a few different kinds and one may hold its scent and smell lovely while others have absolutely no smell whatsoever  its unfortunate
nice and small
this did clean my clothes on a recent trip to europe but then my sister used it and her hands we wet so it turned into a lump we had to just use  the direction very clearly state you must use with dry hands  so pay attention to that and you should like this product
this heated hair straightener brush is okay i didnt like the very small section that the hair should go into to straighten i have a place in the back that has a little curl but the rest of my hair is straight this straightener did not straighten that part of my hairthe box comes with a straightener brush with a power cord the handle has a power button and two buttons for raising and lowering the temperature instructions are includedi will not be recommending this heated hair straightener brush to family and friends
took for a month now still no change its kinda disappointing you spend money hoping for something but there is no drug that makes miracle happen
i bought this iron because it had great reviews and i keep seeing the thyme flat iron in my facebook feed but didnt want to spend a fortune on trying it out  it takes some getting used to you do need to twist the iron as you go but not much i did get an instant curl though you have to be careful not to flatten too much hold in place too long the iron seems like nice quality easy to turn on and change temps and i like the lights as it heats up it is pretty too and has a good weight to it i just got it so i cant speak to it lasting but for the price i am happy
i like the idea but i never figured it out three them away
for the supplement explorer the d3k2 combo has been perfect both are vital both are microvolumedose excellent designthe d3 blood test came on the scene as a routine blood panel i knew that skin produces like 100k times more d3 than science imagined that the body needed i grew up in miami enjoying more sun skin time than anyone had the right to absorb i was shocked shocked i tell you  to discover that i was short d3 how could this possibly bewhatever im happily in the normative range thanks to supplementation the implications of k2 are still a bit new but trust me  you likely need it
love the ease of these
very good product expecting the maker keeps its integrity it does help with a variety of health issues with reliability i highly recommend this product the reason for the only four stars is because the seller has increased considerably the price of it i will be searching for other options although i trust this specific brand i appreciate the sellers delivery also
this scarf is just beautiful and it is lightweight which makes it perfect for spring and summer  the quality is also very good
problem with this belt is you warm up the packet and it can get lava hot but you cannot feel it through the too thick super synthetic material of the pouch so once the super hot gel pack is inserted into the pouch you barely feel it i was looking for one with cotton pouch and clay beads but they were too  had bad ratings this would be great if the pouch was different to transfer the heat from the gel pouch plus after a few times in the microwave the gel seems to be burning through the lining of the gel pack so it might not have great longevity as well
great purchase
got the layers of grease off the cabinets from the place i rent couldnt stop touching the cabinets because they felt like new careful though on certain surfaces it can abrasive
i am buying another one because this was very needed i can actually walk around the house without my knee brace given by the hospital at home its also added support with my knee braceone huge mistake was washing it do they expect it to never be washedso ordering a new one and this time reading washing instructions or washing by hand next time
lovely scent soft silky powder terrific quality as avon products always seem to have
a positive difference noticed within the first day of use
these are excellent towels for certain cleaning tasks they are thin but absorb quickly and hold a decent amount of water they can be rinsed laid flat to dry and reused several times making them go a lot further than a roll of conventional paper towelsthey are ideal for certain cleaning tasks especially windows glass smooth tile and other types of smooth surfaces they are not however all that good for scrubbing or use over a rough surface they can be used for that but the roughness will shred the towel making it only good for one use if used on smooth surfaces they can be rinsed and reused multiple timesfor me these are ideal for washing windows i use a few sheets of these towels with cleaning liquid to get the dirt off the window then use a single microfiber cloth for a final dry and polish the used towels are rinsed and set aside to dry for the next task i can usually get 4 or 5 uses out of a single towel before it starts to shred upmy only quibble is that i dont care for the graphics printed on the towels they arent bad looking just unnecessary other than that no complaints they work well last a good amount of time eliminate the waste of using onetime use paper towels and are a good value compared to other similar towels as well compared with  conventional paper towels since one of these towels can take the place of many onetime use paper towels
barley any power didnt last long
we grilled the 12 lb burgers we got from the treasure truck and they were amazing everyone loved them we just got the hot dogs and sausages today and ive heard good things about those too cant wait
definitely can tell a difference in pump when using this product versus not some over stimulated after if you take it to late
i really like these  in just a day you notice a change in your appetite  but you dont get that caffeine high like some other products  my energy level has also pickedup  great product
we use cotton ball for different things around the house we like our crafts and beauty supplies so its good to have some on hand these are pretty much what you would expect of cotton balls only they are a bit more smaller but slightly more dense and a bit more expensive currently 499
doesnt seem to be catching enough hair or fur
this is a pretty and functional dowsing board a circle of lightweight wood it features attractive center illustrations and large readable responses the back is plain and there is no carrying case bag or box it is nice and functional  it also comes with a complimentary ankh pendant vintage style postcard and little thank you banner
little to no force required durable file on the handle is a nice touch
these dont appear to be real jade but for the price they work as i anticipated soothing and comforting moves lymph and gives a temporary plumping appearance like one would get after a facial or massage
i usually use ayer gel nadal spray when i travel on planes  its the best way to fight getting sick from traveling  keeping your nostrils moist and breathing through your nose is the key to fighting airborne germs  i used this nasal spray on my roundtrip flight to canada  this spray works well but i had to keep reapplying it  the ayer gel spray seems to coat my nostrils better but this spray works well for daily usage  i will continue using the thicker gel nadal spray on planes but i well use this at work and home because it does moisturize my nasal passages when my nose doesnt completely dry out which happens on flights
i added this to my smoothie its got a great definitely i definitely recommended this to everyone who wanted to live a healthy and happy life style plus super fast shipping great seller
i really enjoy this scale even though it does lie lol
works good not to strong but strong enough
dont know yet just got it
really great but the sand timer takes a long time to go down like 3 minutes
i had never used a pumice stone before so the fault is mine i should have ordered a finer grain stone on this one the little holes are so big they are not gentle to my feet  however the item arrived on time and as described
i love these  i worry a lot about traditional sponges and germs and saw these and thought why not try them they are amazing and so easy to disinfect my favorite feature is that one has a built in scraper which is perfect for my stoneware cookware the little hooks are a nice added touch i gave one to my mom and she is hooked
i do not recall having any nose plugs as a child but i guess they would have been made out of dinosaur parts if we did  the kids love them so thats all that counts
i am no longer working in hospital but i use in a free clinic  for humans and animals
so far they seem to do the trick my daughters gaite is offand she has flat feet non verbal autistic her doc suggested inserts and i bought these shes doing so well she even attempts to run now ill probably need to buy a few more
lovely one  convenient comfortable and easy to use love it
barley max has a pretty good taste but when they added the mint i couldnt hardly drink it  it has a sweet taste  it just doesnt work  i will continue to get barley max without the additional ingredientsi will say that this is an excellent product for adding greens to the diet
this is my fifth pair of lollop compression socks however two of the pairs are a smallmedium size and three are medium large this is a mediumlarge and runs a bit bigi take a size 9 to 95 in a womans shoe and 75 to 8 in a mans boot i ordered these in a medium  large size which is supposed to be for that size foot however they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle they do fit around the calves nicely howeveri love that they offer medium compression 1520 mmhg around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches i felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs i also like the normal sock look of these kneehighs and they wash well in the washer but i lay them flat to dry the blue hearts are very attractive even though the offwhite is a bit dingy looking i consider these socks very stylish the material is 45 cotton 40 nylon and 15 spandexif the sizing was specified correctly this would have gotten 5 stars 
my daughter likes to wear stylish sneakers that dont have a lot of arch support she recently came home from college for a visit and only brought the shoes she wore with her which happened to be a pair of these shoes she was using our home elliptical machine and complained afterwards because the shoes werent very supportive i ordered these for her to see if they would help these inserts are customizable they can be trimmed for fit and then there are little pieces that you can add under the arch area in case you need to increase the arch support she says that they do improve the arch support but she would prefer one with extra cushion support in the heel and other areas too overall she does like these and is much happier with her shoes since shes added these
almost the same but perhaps not quite as thick as standard dishwashing gloves you might get from the grocery store  and maybe not quite as long in the sleeves as some others either  regardless they have plenty of great uses around house house including working on the car  anything to cut down on the cleanup time
great quality and really does the job on my car carpet bought a second one for my truck and keeps the run looking greatwho does a review on a brush but so cool i had to take a minute
i havent been using this long so far just once a day im a little confused on dosing there isnt any information regarding it on packaging other than add 1 scoop to your juice smoothy or whatever it says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract powder is that just weight or is that the actual amount because that is 3000 mg of this extract otherwise which is higher than some other similar products out there maybe the serving size just happens to be larger where as the others are smaller with expectation to use it 23 times a day this lack of clear info is frustrating hopefully other reviewers can comment on thatas for how it works well i am not exactly sure what i am looking for it to do and how to measure my experience i know it has been an ingredient used in weight loss formulations and i sure could stand to lose several pounds but im not sure about that for reviewing easily reading through some potential benefits like better digestion better concentration reduced food cravings loss of appetite reduced joint pain improved cholesterol levels  better mood etc i figure the one i can measure best is the food cravings i know what my habits are and i will know if my desire for sugary foods reduces so if i notice a reduction then i can attribute it to this so far not feeling that but it is early on and i have taken but one serving a day i will give it a little more time and report back your desires for taking this as a supplement may vary from my own there is no shortage of info on what this fruit is or its purported benefits are as well as risks such as do not take if have dementia or alzheimers  so please read up i know i am still learningactual product so i will tell you more about the product itself it is an 8 ounce bag of  garcinia cambogia extract powder it is a resealable mylar bag with a front window so you can see how much is in there it comes with a small scoop which is one serving in my pic it shows the little scoop and the amount dumped into my hand there are 76 servings in a container if you plan to use it in liquid plan to use a shaker cup or your blender just stirring it in will not work i included a pic and you can see all the powder just sitting on top strangely my spoon stayed dry so that is when i got out the shaker cup and all blended fine with thatthe taste is absent to me not sure if it supposed to have a noticeable flavor or not the fruit is tart and i hadnt noticed a tart flavor with this maybe my taste buds are off seems that it will go well with yogurt oatmeal blended into smoothies added to soups broths baked goods i have been just consuming it with plain water or some organic lemonade in a shaker cup because like i said it doesnt mix by just stirring the powder is fine and not at all gritty ill likely add it into my next smoothy i havent tried it blended in with coffee next time i will do that i imagine if you like to fill your own capsules that this powder could work for that but i dont know for sureeverything about it seems fresh and of quality i received it in 92019 and it has an expiration date of 32020 6 months from now  if i figure out anything else i will be back to update 3 stars because i need more time with product also i have no idea what the price is and lack of info is concerning

i have not used these yet but they seem good heavy quality at a great price
how hard is it to create a scent that smells like the label and doesnt make your eyes water  nose burn and coat your throat like vapors from a tire fire  ive been very discouraged by all the glade refills ive tried harsh unpleasant and only a passing resemblance to the claims on the label
started having frequent nosebleeds and i keep one in my car in my purse by the bed hospital charged my dad 79 for one of these so this is a deal
this has really helped my success with thm so far knowing that i can make a dessert thats safe and yummy saves my sanity
this is my third main warmer i love it and its worth the money
there are four colorful compression socks in this package i wear a 910 shoe so i selected the largexlarge size a compression rating of 2030mmhg is supposed to be firm and strong however the compression is very light also the toe box feels as if it is sewn awkwardly on the sock it is not uncomfortable but has to be adjusted just so to feel besti wore these all day and they look and feel great these colors are fun and the socks feel almost like regular kneehighs  overall i do like them but i took off one star for not feeling like a compression rating of 2030mmhg and another star for the weird toe box
i bought this  20 years ago not from amazon and its still going strong  i have thin wispy hair and this keeps it all up in a bun very nicely and for hoursrecommend this
i love how great it cleans and how wonderful it smells
we used it a few times and it just stopped working
it actually works its not a quick relief but it takes the headache away it does not feel greasy or sticky
great buy perfect size for a variety of uses the included earplugs are nice too
bought this when i was a little strapped for cash and needed wick for my attys this works extremely well no wicking time very soft very workable and it is economically sound i love my cotton bacon and torii wicks but i definitely will stock up on these and keep them in my supply
love this for tender aching feet big enough not to spill over
great alternative soap
simple natural and organic ingredients the flavor is good they taste like other honey lemon lozenges ive tried before they even have silver with helps fight off infections definitely handy to have and work well for fighting off sickness

i have a model 454 that must be at least 30 years old and it keeps on going  ive tried electric white noise makers over the years but they just arent the same  cant really explain why they just arent  when mine finally conks out im definitely going to get another one  i live in a noisy area a bad one too with gunshots loud cars noisy neighbors and the like and this unit does an amazing job keeping the noises downjust did a google search for the model 454 i got thisit is billed as sleepmate by marpac of wilmington nc it is model number 454this item is circa the 1960s 1960s  wow guess its lasted longer than i thought
there is hate but this is like the classic mac and cheese but i liked it more just your basic tasting noodles and fake cheese powder give it a try
i threw these away almost as soon as i opened them up  way too short  didntt fit at all
its very difficult to rate any vitamin tablet unless its toxic i have taken these for three days now and nothing has happened to me i can only assume that they are valid vitamin d3 and generally are good for aiding in the absorption of calcium and may be helpful in the prevention of osteoporosis and osteomalacia as we get older this vitamin is vital for keeping our bones strong so that if and when we fall our bones will not break or not break as badly were we not taking vitamin d3i have a history of falling and in fact have fallen many times because of a balance issue i have been taking vitamin d3 for 10 years and have yet to break any bones a bone density test revealed that i have excellent bone density for  a man of my agei find taking vitamin d3 very good for me and my pcp is adamant that i take d3 every day
felt great on scalp would definitely recommend

i ordered this for my furbaby as water through a dropper is the only way he will drink water droppers alone  are really hard to find in stores around here usually the dispenser for giving meds to kids is included in package and the price is higher than here at amazon so far it serves the purpose  for which i purchased it also i found a small brush that fits into the dropper for thorough cleaning well worth the purchase
itll take me forever to use all of these tags but they are gorgeous exactly what i was looking for
very nice dispenser and i keep it in my kitchen because it is a much more economical way to keep and use paper towels 
pros1 vegan with no gelatin2 tastes good fresh and chewy3 moderate price range4 no iron5 contains iodine which is important for thyroid healthcons1 this is a basic gummy adult multivitamin you can obtain a very similar generic version through your local big box store for about onethird the price of this product
i usually check my blood pressure whenever im at a pharmacy or location with the little sit down booth i got this so i could monitor my bp at home to get an idea of my readings to keep better track it is easy to use fits my 34larger34 arm with no issues it has really great memory settings for 2 people very comfortable and my readings are very consistent
love the bottles and the color is gorgeous
nice quality and quite sturdy will see how will hold over time and under shower conditions
ssooooo uncomfortable  the thick velcro straps double back under your armpit and its like having 2 belts wrapped up under your arms miserable i couldnt wear it 10 minutes
happy with how affordable this is and that its wireless
extremely uncomfortable im a bigger woman with broad shoulders but im not that big this is ridiculously tiny it cut off circulation to my arms and it pulled the velcro loose because it ended up in the back i bought another cheaper one and it fit comfortably with the right size adjustments being available this is for very skinny or very small people
i am always looking for inserts with good arch support to help alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis usually i am disappointed in the orthotics on the market however this insert is wonderful it has the right balance of firmness and pliability which makes it feel cushiony without being overly soft or overly hard it also has a high arch that is very supportive for someone like me who has plantar fasciitisi take at 9 to 95 in shoes and sometimes a 10 depending on the cut therefore i ordered this in that womans size i use these in my bootlike slippers and i feel like i am walking on airthe current price of 1784 2099 minus 15 is competitively priced for an arch support of this quality and support they are thick comfortable and perfect for me i absolutely adore these
this will pick up a small amount of dirt from a smooth surface compared to a regular vac this is not even in the same game and fails miserably in comparison it is helpful in certain occasions such as when petting your pet and some hair get dropped on the rug and you dont feel like getting out your regular vac
great bib for a messy eater
i was told that by adding this supplement to my regular regime it would help me with a better absorption of vitamins not sure if thats true or not as i didnt notice a difference at all
just what i was looking for to take grout haze off of stone tiles  would have taken me days to do it by hand instead of hours with these
no more baggy in your pocket love that they stack easily for space saving open easy and nice pictures on them
i purchased these to clean black marks off a brand new kitchen counter at my office the counter became scratched up from tin foil catering trays and general use and regular soap wasnt doing the job with a little arm power i was able to get off most of the black marks using the magic eraser 
this thing saves a bunch of time and mess and they know it cause they charge a premium  its probably 30cents of plastic you could easily make at home if you had the right toolsskills also had to drill the hole out cause its extremely difficult to push caulking out as is but it did make the job way easier just wish i didnt have to send them an arm and a leg for their price gouging
not good at all
i bought these for my sister who is a practicing wiccan  she likes to use crystals in her craft but i thought these would be good for spell jars  they are presorted into little glass bottles so you dont have to pick through the lot to get to what you need  the jars are labeled and have a cute little cork as a stopper  the gems themselves are small enough chips for even tiny spell jars  they are polished so you dont have to worry about  sharp edges
i like this using this organic peppermint and camphor lotion to massage my shoulders and back this is my first time trying this product and im surprised and satisfied
this has a 5 concentration of potassium nitrate which is the ingredient used in all sensitive toothpastes to cut down or in my case eliminate sensitive teeth issues as such it works the same as other sensitive toothpastesit does differ from others with regard to taste and consistency it has a mild minty taste that while acceptable is not all that fresh tasting the consistency is a bit softer than other toothpastes and it doesnt foam up as much while thats usually a plus good foaming action is a benefit when it comes to sensitive toothpastes since it helps the potassium nitrate get into all the nooks and crannies my favorite sensitive toothpaste is the colgate foaming action one it has the same 5 potassium nitrate as this but the foaming action does make a differencewhile the tube looks big theres not a lot of product its only filled about 12 of the way and while it looks like a standard size tube it only provides 35 oz of toothpaste its also hard to get all of it out of the tube since the tube is plastic and does not roll up it dispenses fine when mostly full but is not great at dispensing when the level gets lowwhile this does work the negatives put my score at 3 stars average not a compelling purchase compared with other options
havent really noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth i have been using it once a day it is a very fine powder
vitamin d3 is one of several supplements which if i take in pill or table form upsets my stomach so as with those other supplements am happy to try this d3 in gummy form  these gummies are really good  their fruity flavor tastes great they dissolve easily do not upset my stomach and are a good dosage  2 gummies  2000 iu  priced reasonably and made with citrus fruit pectin this one is worth adding to my daily health regime
this is great maca  super digestion as it is gelatinized and i noticed significant improvements in hormonal values and energy within a couple of days  ive also added this to my wifes smoothie protocol as well and her fibromyalgia has significantly reduced  quite accidentally i ended up leaving the stuff behind when taking a trip and within a couple of days all of the effects started to disappear  got right back on it when i got homeon the flip side i purchased this stuff at 21  just 3 months ago and now its over 31  not happy about that  however i do note that they give you discounts on shipping if you order more than one so theres that
we do a lot of day trips with a little one that spits up quite a bit its great to have a small portable stain fighting spray for those not so small stains you dont want to set in no more worry about stained clothes because you couldnt wash it right away travel stain fighter ftw
great price taste good and good packaging can not speak on benefits just received but i have been talking pollen for a while and its good stuff

i gave this nac 5 stars because its easy to swallow it doesnt upset my stomach and its the 1st nac ive taken that doesnt smell like stinky rotten eggs upon opening the bottle every day there still is a subtle smell but totally bearable
i was informed that dgl licorice would be helpful for acid reflux  it did not work for me
good product
at some points i enjoyed this but using it as hoped to sit behind my head while im driving or safely parked during lunch the strap didnt hold up the unit in place like o wanted to and this soon dropped too low to stay up from the elastic band wearing down too fast and not way to tighten it down

every beard is different and i wish i had one like chris stapleton but unfortunately i dont i like the groomed and tailored beard set but my beard is not quite there yet i love the quality of the items and especially like the scissors the three tools come in a cloth bag
this is a great cleaner for getting stickers and what not off of flat or slightly curved surfaces  the included razor scraper makes very quick work or any stubborn stickers  we used it to remove registration stickers in the cars and to remove some old vinyl clings from some windows  scraper holds the blades firmly and prevents slips and accidental cuts
it doesnt not blink in any way that is described in the listing absolute waste of money

i have been using this for a hot minute 1 tablespoon on an empty stomach will get your there quick remember that kava is fat soluble so take it with almond or coconut milk not a bad bang for your buck
the smell does not last for more than 30 minutesi bought it for my new zealand wool dryer ballsi think it is rather expensive for its poor qualitybut the smell is nice

i have been wanting to check my ph levels as i have been having stomach issues so when this item was made available to me for a reduced price for my honest opinion and review i jumped on it  the first day i tested my saliva along with my urine and both tested the same around 55 which means my system is acidic a range of ph 6575 is perfect  ph below 65 is to acidic and a level above 75 is to alkaline the ph of a person is very informative as to what is going on inside your body if your ph is to acidic you can experience fatigue headaches and many other symptoms  if you system is to alkaline that can cause joint pain nerve pain insomnia and other issues  by daily monitoring your ph levels you can get your range in the perfect spot by adjusting your diet  i just checked  my levels for today and i am now in that sweet spot  these test strips work great they come with a ph chart on the label and a printed copy with directions this is fast and easy to useyou get results in 15 seconds this bottle contains 200 strips  thank you to healthy wiser for allowing me to try their product
this disney bag is soooo cute
my lips have never been in such a good condition no more lines and peeling i just cant say enough about this product its like silk on your lips but most of all it works
ive been looking for an organic dandelion and milk thistle supplement and there were no many choices that have both in them i am sensitive  to alot of things whether it be supplements or food i have not had any adverse reactions to these but i do not take take them everyday i have a peace of mind to know i am taking a supplement without some type of pesticide or chemical used
this is the worst tooth floss i have ever used  you will be able to clean between two teeth before it breaks even if you double it up it still breaks very very thin  it would be good for hanging christmas decorations  it would be impossible to floss your whole mouth with one strand without it breaking
impressed that it actually works and relieves my pain
i use this to make a muesli for breakfast i like that its organic
the plastic seal was broken also the twist seal on the lid was damaged not on the grooves of the bottle completely so when i twisted to open it the entire thing came off this seems to be what caused the oil to leak out in the packaging about 15 of the bottle it smelled strongly of lime when i opened the box so i knew immediately it had leaked regarding the scent it is refreshing and a pleasant lime smell i would have given this 5 stars if it wouldnt have leaked
bought these for my son who loves them
best powder ever  no longer getting a rash under my chest  will always purchase and use especially in hot weather

my son is a doodler and this was perfect for him
i wasnt sure what to expect with this as i usually take pills for my b12  the taste is good  my only real complaint is a dropperful is supposed to be 1ml but i have yet to be able to get the full 1ml in the dropper  the most i can get it to go is to 75ml
its fine closes securely and doesnt pop open like i feared and i leave it in my bag while i haul it all over campus books and laptop hitting iti initially worried about the pills mixing into each other because it doesnt look like the divider reaches to top of the case but it wasnt a problem for me i have fairly small pills but if yours are particularly small id do a shake test on itunintuitive to clean its hard to get into all the corners but thats inherent in this type of case i just didnt think about that before i bought itblack case isnt fully opaque like youd think it would be and the  sign is mostly transparent if you want to hide the contents not the case for you
after not finding a cure for waking up every night at 3am not 259 or 301 and finding that ambien was actually not suited for me i sought the help of an alternative medical doctor has all the sheepskin of an official practitioner but leans heavily on homeopathic and new age medicine i highly recommend this type of medicine esp if you are menopausal and your doc wants to prescribe synthetic medshe told me to google the chinese medicine wheel and at or around 3am i would find whatmy ailment was  it was an issue with my liver  he had me use hepa trope take one twice a day  after 2 days of hepa trope i slept through the night  no ambien hangover or eyes popping open at 3am  i am on my 2nd bottle and still take it almost everydayhe sells this in his office but he is 45 minutes from me plus the amazon price is a bit friendlier and arrives in a couple of days
i use 6 diffusers throughout our home daily and i spend a small fortune on essential oils i have used the same company for years and i never thought i could be swayed to like oils from any other company until i tried the oils in salty essential oils i tried the lemon in my hall bathroom because it was a smaller space and i wanted to see if i could smell the oil  it was fantastic i tried this same experiment with the frankincense and bergamot fabulous the scents last after the diffuser has run out as i write this i have been enjoying orange in my living room i love that each oil has an explanation of what it can be used forexample sleep headache etc what an unexpected pleasure this product has brought to me i am so glad i ordered it
arrived on time easy to use accurate a great product im ordering these again
is what was suspected
this works incredibly well for smelly shoes if you follow the directions i washed my boots and they started smelling a couple days later so i tried this for several days and it worked  i was skeptical because this is not a chemical product but it works really really well  and smells great  i also love that it doesnt leave any powder residue in the shoes like other products on the market
comfortable easy to use provides support
it does what is suppose to
i like that i can wear this tens unit even when im out shopping  the main machine fits in my pocket easilysetting it up is easy  just need to take the time to find the best mode and intensity to suit your needssome areas i can do stronger intensity while other areas a lighter tough is neededthis has so many modes to choose from  i personally love the deep tissue  works great and feels so good on my back when i pull a certain musclegives enough pads to last awhileone of the better tens unit ive tried
works amazing on my pandora jewelry but the cleaner does smell like eggs as long as u rinse off the jewelry after using the cleaner the smell goes away and they look amazing
did nothing 
my favorite thing about this is the button that you push to pop open the lid  its well made so should be durable
highly recommended
overall i am impressed with the effectiveness of these s they are intended silky waterproof like material on one side and soft fleecy material on the other they are meant for low flow which i am really only most comfortable with using it for very light days so please keep that in mind i always wear a liner for various reasons i am using these for that purpose they do not leak there is no odor that i have notices and the material is so soft and comfortable my lady bits like the fleecy feel when done i toss it in the wash or hand wash depending on what i feel likewhile the liners stayed put in a manner that kept me covered  do notice some shifting i am larger in size so underwear is larger and it seems that these were quite loose i think a second button snap right along the first to make more narrow andor a second set to also help keep it in place right now it is one snap loose fit it may not be limited to these this may be the norm this is my first experience with reusable cloths i really like the idea and while i am not ready to fully swap out i can comfortable using these in place of my daily liner or paired with a resuable menstrual cup but for flow i am not there yet in terms of confidence
overall this is a pretty decent mop and bucket set  the mop is excellent the pole is metal and the sections thread together well the threaded portion is recessed into each section making for a very durable solid connection that wont come apart or loosen when using the mop the mop head is not threaded but it has a good quality snap button attachment  the only moprelated complaint i have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic its a decent quality thick plastic but metal would have been nice since thats a strain point on the mopthe mop head covers are of good quality and attach well with velcro to the mop head two pads are provided in the set while they can be machine washed its better to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat it reduces the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machinethe bucket design could have been better it is smaller than another similar product that i have which is actually a positive since it weighs less when full of water however it lacks some key convenience features such as a popopen drain at the base it is also not possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use the overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat lightweight especially the handle it lacks the heft and durability of other similar productswhile the bucket issues brings my score to 4 stars this is still a very good performing set its easy to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a spring that allows it to automatically fold vertically so it can be inserted into the bucket the squeegee on the dry side does a good job of wringing out the water the ability to have a wet and a dry side to the bucket makes mopping quicker easier and results in a better jobnot perfect but a decent value for the price
holds a lot of stuff in our small rv very well made too only thing is our headrest is one piece and it is a tight connect
these arent returnable so think carefully before you choose to buy them i bought them to replace an old ace bandage but they are so short slippery and weak   i went back to using the old ace bandage  i think i will donate these and then go buy another bandage  waste of time and money
i ordered this by mail when i was away from home to be sure it would be waiting for me when i returned  these vitamins are recommended by health care professionals for women

wore this on flights in january when flu season was rampant finally stayed well no flu or uri first time flying without getting sick in three years
when toilet paper became so scarce at the beginning of the pandemic i ordered a bidet sprayer httpswwwamazoncomgpproductb01e4h7dta to cut down on tp use then all i had to worry about was using just enough tp to dry off then i got these washable bamboo makeup removers that fit nicely in a little ceramic pot on the back of my toilet and they work great for drying off not only that when used with a lowsudsing feminine wash i can wash my private parts as needed and cut down on how often i waste water bathingfor someone who is retired with little activity and very dry skin there really is no need to bathe more than once a week as long as the privates are washed daily i like that i can do this while sitting on the toilet and not risk a fall i have osteoporosis getting in and out of the tub besides i hear a number of celebrities are now advocating not bathing very frequently so i must be cooli got two packs of 16 makeup removers each and each pack comes with a nice mesh bag for washing the rounds in the washing machine so i keep a bag beside the toilet to hold the ones ive used and when the clean ones are all gone i just start on the second pack while the other is in the wash the little bit of soap left on each used round prevents it from getting groady until wash timeim very very pleased with this product and id give it an extra star if i could for the washing bag
we do not use anything else nothing compares love it just a bit more expensive but worth it hair doesnt get sticky goes on light  i do wish there was no odor daughter freaks out about breathing it in tell her it is good stuff but she doesnt like it so sometimes i am chasing that head around
im an adult and i use baby lotion as recommended by my doctor for myself because of how incredibly sensitive and incredibly dry my skin is in my quest to find a lotion that does not make my skin hurt this almost worked my skin reacted to it minimally but this stuff isnt hydrating at all when you put it on it feels pretty good but a halfhour later my skin feels just as dry as before i do however use the sweet apple body wash and that has been a gamechanger best body wash ive ever used but the lotion is a miss for me
motif medical motif twistthe twist is a small lightweight very portable breast pump it comes with a 24mm one piece breast flange with a comfort cushion it can be battery operated with four aa batteries it is rather cute in appearance to me and it comes with a one year warranty replacement parts can be hard to get if one is attempting to order direct however aeroflowbreastpumpscom carries motif medical replacement parts the pump comes with no accessories if you need a tote and cooler youll have to purchase your own warranty on the pump is one year from date of purchase or received through insurancewhats included 4 valves and membranes 2 wide neck bottles ml volume only with nipples and hard plastic sealing disc 2 one piece flanges with comfort cushions  caps flanges included is the standard 24mm only 1 ac power adapter 2 sets of tubingpros twist is a closed pump meaning there is a barrier usually a diaphragm that prevents milk and condensation from entering the tubing small and lightweight which makes for high portability its far lighter than my avent double electric comfort pump and that too is far lighter than other double electric pumps parts is interchangeable with the motif curve flanges is rather light in comparison to other full one piece bodies comfort cushion makes for one of the most comfortable pumping experiences twist has two phase expression when the pump is turned on it starts in the letdown phase where it replicates the faster suckling a baby would do to get milk flowing turning the dial up enters the expression phase when expressing i noted that higher suction has a longer pull on the nipple with some hacks flangesflange bodies can be used from other closed pumps other bottles than can be pumped into is avent classicnatural and dr browns wide neck bottle this is only if using motif flanges twist is a double electric pump allowing mom to express from both breast at the same timecons pump is loud its comparable to avent double electric comfort pump in terms of loudness motif only carries a 24mm flange and a 28mm flange parts is hard to get at this time what i noted is only aeroflowbreastpumpscom carrying all of motif replacement parts one must use motif brand valves and membranes or duckbill valves the flange opening where the valve would go is far smaller than medela so trying to use medela valvemembranes or third party ones from nene supplymayomom will not work with the motif twist flanges tubing is double ended which forces a lactating mom to use motif parts  i did a hack and cut one of the ends off allowing for me to use flangeflange bodies from other companies i also noted that the tubing is rather soft and has some stretch to it allowing for me to remove the excess plastic from the end for use with spectra tubing thus far i was able to use my avent comfort flanges and my medela personal fit connectors with pumpinpals flanges with the motif twist 60 most commercial single user breast pumps use vacuum technology so flanges can be used interchangeably between brands62  this is a personal con which may not be across the board for all moms vaccum sucks the nipple and areola in well and creates good suction i noted this phenomenon between three different company flanges where removing the flange from the breast is a bit of a task and has sort of a pop like noise from the release i dont have this feeling when using electric breast pumps from other companies motif medical only has monday through friday customer service from 8am5pm estupdate 172018i called motifs customer service asking about replacement parts and a larger flange size please understand that cutting the tubing to use different company flanges can and will void out your warranty parts is covered for 3m and motor is one year according to the warranty i was informed that a 32mm flange is in the works and should be available soon this year i was sent two 28mm flanges and extra valvemembranes although i have been using size 30mm flanges for most of my pumping career i recently changed out to size 28mm to note that i am able to express well with the size 30mm may be more comfortable for me to use with no chances of my nipple hitting the back of the flangesmotif has an interesting flange for size 28mm the body and flange is separate from each other the diaphragms i noted is bigger than what is included with the 24mm flange its a small pot and is far deeper than the 24mm ones 24mm flange has a shallow pot diaphragm  the flange is also shaped like a pot it covers all of my areola and is quite comfortable its far more comfortable than medela in my opinion i also decided to change valves from the two piece valvemembrane thing most companies put out i switched to a third party duckbill valve from nenesupply also sold on amazon and noted that it fits onto the flanges and work well the valvemembrane combination doesnt offer good suction thus i need a higher vacuum to express with maymom another third party after market retailer also sold on amazon carries a thread changer which also works well with motif flanges with the thread changer i was able to express into medela and ameda narrow neck bottles just fine the thread changer only works properly with duckbill valves that arent avent  avent style valves one cannot express with using the thread  thread also works well with the two piece valvemembrane combinationoverall i would recommend the twist its a high quality pump and i personally respond to it well flanges are quite comfortable to use and the pump is extremely light weight the pump is rather loud but its no louder than other pumps close to its size replacement parts may be hard to obtain but aeroflow carries them as well as a call to customer service one can get them third party duckbill valves work with motif flanges and the 28mm flanges is easy to cleanupdate 372018i recently went looking for replacement parts only to note that 1 motif updated their website to include a parts store 2 the 28mm flange was updated 32 is still not available neither is a full flange size 21mm or 19mm currently the insert for the 24mm flange reduces the flange down to a 21mm there is an insert for the 28mm flange however i was informed via customer service that its only for added comfort and it doesnt change the flange sizethe 28mm flange is now a single one piece body with a shallow pot diaphragm it was changed as i was told the old version was more expensive to produce than the current model the new 28mm flange has a very similar appearance to the 24mm flange included with the pump i have yet to receive and use the new model but i shall soon and update this review againupdate 3272018i recently called motif customer service as my pump is still under warranty for parts i inquired about the 28mm flanges i was sent another set of flanges though with shipping one of my flanges arrived broken  its no big deal as the original set i was sent is still functioning just fine motif has not changed their 28mm flanges its still a two piece item with a larger pot diaphragm  the parts store shows a replacement diaphragm being the same size as it is for the 24mm flange from what i am seeing via photos and what originally came with my pump the 24mm flange body has a  shallower pot for the diaphragm parts store claims the flanges both 24mm and 28mm use the same size diaphragm but such is not the case as one is far bigger than the other there is still no other flange size out side of 24mm and 28mm 28mm flange now has an insert i have not used nor ordered as the flange is very comfortable to usestill i would recommend the pump for mamas who use the available flange sizes its still a high quality pump and i believe it performs far better than my spectra s2 and my medela pisa  pump in style advance customer service is good and motif makes quality breast pumpsupdate 09122018i recently noted that motif medical has taken to offering their replacement parts and flanges on amazon we can not order breast flange kits with valvesmembranes and tubing included breast flange inserts replacement valvesmembranes diaphragms extra flanges and so on is now sold on here making it convenient to get partsmy pump now being 8m old is currently in the process of being replaced after doing routine maintenance of replacing tubing duckbills  i dont respond well to the valvemembrane combo so i dont use them  and diaphragms monthly i noted that my pump is no longer able to provide me with adequate suction even when increasing the suction on the pump with daily use of three plus times a day it is past its prime as with other pumps ive replaced in the past the old motor will be sent back in exchange for  the new motor i never used the pump as a double as for me i noted that it doesnt perform well as such i always used my pump as a single and on ac power never battery using any pump as a double kills the vacuum strength thus motor is worked harder and mom would need to use higher suction overall i would still recommend this pump for moms on the go now that parts is easier to get and the fact the pump is reasonably priced even when its on sale
shipping was incredibly fast and i actually received three thank goodness because one broke as i was learning to use it and the other got deformed when i finally got it in it makes a gorgeous bun but the product is not sturdy enough for multiple uses
i needed a new shaker bottle and decided to give this one a try  ive used this for a few days now and i am very satisfied with my purchase  its leakproof which is good considering i throw it in my gym bag  the blender ball works just as well as any other blender ball out there  i really like the nonslip grip that they put on the sides finger grove area and the bottom of the bottle  it really helps with not dropping the bottle when there is condensation all over it  my only wish is that there was a ring or a loop or something on the bottle to make it a little easier to hold
works fine and the price is good id buy this again
this stuff tastes great and helps me thru my workouts
beautiful color and big flakes i love this product if i ever run out i will buy more without hesitation
this is a beautiful copper magnetic bracelet ive only worn it for a day and havent had any pain in my fingers like i do at times ill update as i notice anything i received a discount for an honest review
love the packaging for travel since a little goes a long way you will probably get more from this pouch than you thinkeasy to dispense doesnt irritate my dry  sensitive skin has a slight scent that fades quickly  didnt trigger any migraines always a win from something with fragrancethe lotion itself is nice easy to blend into the skin makes my skin feel pretty nice the best part though is definitely the packaging besides being travel  storage space friendly you dont have to put your fingers into a jar and so youre not contaminating the rest of the lotion every time you use it
i have purchased quite a few different supplements and had some free sample sizes from bulk supplements over the last few years horsetail is a herb i have heard about but never thought seriously adding it to my regimen until recently listening to a video on alternative dentistry horsetail is the goto herb for healthy teeth and gums i ordered the herb from bulk supplements and began to take 1teaspoon a day the color of the powder is brown and the taste tolerable i was concerned about the quality and freshness though after taking it for 2 weeks i couldnt tell one way or the other if it was having any effect at all in the meantime i decided to order the same herb through another well known company that only sells fresh dried herbs oils etc organically grow and american made it arrived today this new one is like night and day it is green and smells earthyfresh it is still just tolerable to taste but that is pretty typical with herbs i chuck it back with just enough water to get it down then chase with at least a cup of purified water so sorry bs but your product just doesnt pass the quality test with this particular herb i wouldnt recommend it and i plan on purchasing other herbs from the other company because i know it is high quality
this is like putting white out on your teeth  dont waste your money 
update  01062021had to get my hands on the new flavors tried the sample pack and loved them great tasting with the same buzzoriginal reviewim no stranger to caffeine as someone who has always taken preworkouts and drank energy drinks i have a pretty high tolerance to the stuff im always on the lookout to try new products and came across this sample pack of neus three flavors and figured id give it a whirlthe three shots arrived quickly to my door and i waited for the right moment to try the first one all the flavors were good but i personally liked the original tropical punch the best green i took the first shot before a night out and it worked great the stuff is smooth and i felt a lift in my mood about 15 mins after taking it its nice because the 2oz shot doesnt leave you full of liquid just crazy good energy i felt great all night and had zero crash which was exactly what i was looking fori find that the 300mg of caffeine is the sweet spot for me its enough to get me going and not too much where i feel too jittery this product hits that sweet spot perfectly it also has other ingredients like b12 and choline for an additional brain boost overall the formula is strong the product looks amazing and the flavors are greati would highly recommend trying these out for your next night out on the town study session or in the office as a pick me up
i dont like the coconut milk in my coffee or tea but i use this whenever light coconut milk is mentioned in a recipe this is a good alterative to buying cans of coconut milk which i use up easily  this 8 oz resealable packet will last me a long time while the canned milk is undeniably thicker and creamier adding warm water to this powdered version still yields enough rich coconut flavor to be satisfactory for my thai dishes i add a spoonful of red or green curry to a frying pan add in the prepared light coconut milk add some ginger lemongrass etc and i have a delicious curry sauce its also nongmo and vegan which is great i wish id known about this product earlier i would have stopped having to buy cans all the time
i have used this every day for the last 5 months and i love it  i have a suv and it still fills the air with the wonderful scent of my essential oils
very easy to attach to glasses very comfortable
quality for a decent price
great little things for small messes and small hands
these bags were perfect for the job i needed them for  i have a tin and treats i put in these bags and it worked ut perfectly  i would buy again maybe not sturdy for some jobs but perfect for this one
i am loving this facial brush i use it in the shower with face wash and so far so good im glad i could get rid of using a washcloth it is made of a soft silicone so not damaging to my skin it also suctions to the shower wall i washed it in the dishwashing machine without any issues
these scales are accurate and hold up well with 4 women using them on a daily basis they are a breeze to move around and super easy to read even in the dark theyre black and sleek which adds to their appeal this was a good purchase
when it comes to winter sometimes we dont always have access to the vegetables that we want to have  i love to have juice but sometimes it just is not possible to get fresh vegetables at times  having this powder is a great alternativewhat is this powder likethis powder comes in a great packaging which seems to keep the powder dry very nicely  it is cut open and then you can reseal it  the powder is raw beets but is freeze dried so you have to keep this closed at all times before and after you access ithow do i use iti either put this in my vegetable juice that i make fresh and blend it in my hand blender or if desperate i add it to cold water and drink it in my mini blender  i also have used it to make a keto version of red forest cake which is out of this world by the way  you just have to add more liquid to counteract the powderthe bottom linefor a great way to get beet juice into your diet when vegetables are not handy this is an excellent alternative  the powder is easy to use tastes fresh and mixes well either in fresh juice or water or you can use it in recipes toomy ratingfive stars  i love how versatile it is and between the juice and red forest keto cake i am most likely going to keep this in my cupboard when i run out i will buy more
i bought the cleats mainly because it came with the tool but the tool is too small and not sturdy enough to remove cleats from a golf  at first i used pliers to get some torque on the cleat but it didnt work  i ended up buying a softspikes cleat kaddy which was very easyif you want great cleats buy this item but not for the tool
i purchased this replacement bulb for my slvr410  this is not the same model as the slv410  the bulbs i ordered and received had the plug on the outside of the ring rather than the inside of the ring and were unusable  that said i went straight to the manufacturer and they explained the problem to me and sent me the correct bulb for the slvr410 which is replacement part number fb681
im pleased with these vitamin c gummies they have a light citrus taste thats very pleasant the consistency is perfect  soft enough to easily chew but not something that sticks to my teeth the gummies are covered with granular sugar which keeps them from sticking to one another even in humid weatherthe vitamin c content is decent with each serving of 2 gummies providing 240mg thats not as high as other gummies but for me its a good dosage level the echinacea content is pretty low at 35mg per serving still i use these for the vitamin c so the echinacea is more like a bonus than something i find essential to have the price is a little high but not out of range for a 60 count bottleoverall score of 45 stars ill round up to 5 since im so pleased with the taste and consistency
i got what i needed to wake up and get out to my commute while its still dark  i am the poster child for 34not a morning person34  this makes it happen
i have to be careful with these or they give me a terrific headache be careful of taking with anything else
i purchased this case to protect my oils for an upcoming move overseas i love the print that i chose and the extras that came with it it seems to be a pretty sturdy case holds all of my oils perfectly the 5ml bottles are a tad bit loose in the slots but thats not a problem right now the 15ml bottles fit very snug which is perfect i will try to remember to update after my flight to let you guys know whether the case protected the oils or not
i like that these are soft packaging easy to carry in your car purse anywhere good value  why soft on the skin would buy again
did nothing at all for my milk supply  stick with straight fenugreek
received this for my wifeshes been using it for about a month now and reports that its a good trimmer  she regularly uses it for legs and armpits and that other area  good for legarmpits all year round as well as winter maintenance in the other areashe does say that you if you have darkthick hair you still need to wax if youre going to the beachpool  but lightfair hair will probably not need tomy electric shaver was out of power and i used it on my face  thankfully it worked  i see it as revenge since i know shes been using my electric shaver without my permission
this is an easy and effective way to ice an injured area i use it on my leg where i was injured and also  it works greats on leg cramps at night the roller part stays in the freezer for when you need it  you just pop on the roller to the handle and its ready to go it rolls easily and smoothly and then when you are done it cleans up easily the roller stays icy cold for plenty of time  i have yet to run out of cold while using  the handle fits my hand nice and it it comfortable to hold and use the roller rolls smooth this also works great when i have neck pain or a migraine
these were nice enough but i did notice some cosmetic defects in the surface on 2 of the 3  disappointed with that
this is great in my basement bath where we keep an xl litter box for 2 cats i was impressed will be purchasing 2 more units to put in other areas of the basement highly recommend
these are fantastic i take 9 pills a daythree different times of the day i also have neuropathy in my hands due to past chem infusions it was difficult to open that many pill bottles throughout the day these are super easy to open and easy to fill  i also recently took them on a cruise with me and they were wonderful and traveled well i highly recommend these
awful dont waste your money i purchased this amp it didnt last a full year everything i did to clean per instructions still will not work i will never purchase from this company again
great product fast delivery
ive gone back to natural nails and needed files for them i knew the 240 would be okay and was hoping the 180 would work it does the job but i only use the 180 side for shortening my nails its a bit rough and isnt at all good for shaping that being said the 240 is what i was looking for and its easy enough to tell the difference so you dont use the wrong side
the photos were misleading it comes with one sheet and it is thick too
comfortable and as advertised you can still hear everything just that really loud sounds are blocked and reduced in volume i use them several days a week and have had no problems with them recommended
these work great the are long enough to wash dishes and do other household cleaning you get 2 pair in different  colors so you wont get the ones for the bathroom mixed up with kitchen gloves they keep your hands clean and do a wonderful job
the plates are extra tiny and super flimsy cups are also very small the banners are cute napkins are fine but overall the set is pretty disappointing
easily adjustable not too tight and changes sizes easily
the only reason this cane holder gets a single star is due to the fact there is no way to assign a zero star  the manufacturer and seller should be embarrassed to sell this item due to its poor construction lack of instructions and poor design  do not purchase thisits a total waste of money
i purchased these for my dad got him two pair  these really help with circulation of the feet this company has several other sleeve braces that are very comfortable and help with circulationmy first one was for my knee after surgery my arthopedic said no braces well these are not braces but sleevesi originally heard from the people who invented this material that our soldiers in afghanistan used them to help circulate blood to their feet to help them feel warm in the cold desert night  they could not wear anything that generated real heat because it would make their feet sweat and in the cold air not goodi was getting foot cramps and these helped my sleep better at night  i know you are supposed to wear them with your shoes which i did but found them more comfortable at night to make my feet feel warm not hoti will tell you my knee healed faster than expected which was great since i travel for work and need to walk alot  i noticed my knee didnt get as tired so i got a set for both kneesthen i got the socks too  not just these but the ones that go above the knee  then i got one for the elbow  yeah im that jacked upi know the quality of these and have recommended to facebook friends who live across the country told them if you dont like them you can return them  they had similar knee surgerythey had similar experience and also got the socks odd the knee and foot issues seem to go hand in hand or foot in footthey to have recommended this brand to their friends  when i see someone hobbling around i ask then tell them google incrediwear read the reviews then order on amazon
this is an amazing toothbrush i have metal in my lower bottom gums with holes to snap into the teeth i went looking on amazon and found this amazing product they keep help get the food out i will be a couple more because they come from another country and it takes a little longer to get them so i will buy two more
these delightful brittle  do i call them a candy or a cookie  are different and tasty  only problem is i want to eat the whole bag at one time  i prefer the chocolate chip to the other flavors but im sure thats a preference and not a reflection on the product
seriously i love this thing  i hate washing and fixing my hair because it takes forever as i have very thick wavy hair that holds moisture  it takes me at least an hour to blow dry usually still damp at the back of my scalp and straighten my hair  ive taken to using dry shampoo for 3 and 4 days to avoid washing and doing the process all over again  well this brush solves all my problems  the day after i got it i took a shower at night letting my hair air dry a little bit before bed  when i woke the next morning it was pretty gnarly looking think janis joplin i sprayed it with my heat protectant and hit it with the blowdryer for roughly 5 minutes just to make sure it was completely dry that underneath layer was still damp  i cranked the brush up to 450f while i was blow drying and she was ready by the time i was done  i brushed my hair thoroughly to make sure there were no knots to snag  then the miraculous occurred i think i heard a heavenly choir singing  i slowly brushed the first section of my hair  there was no strange pulling no scalding piece of hair to hold no weird kinks against my scalp but it was straight  oh wonder of wonders miracle of miracles  i did one side and then decided i needed to document this process  i went and got dressed must wear a bra for the public good and grabbed my phone to take a few pictures  i started with the brush at 708 and with wardrobe changes and selfies i ended at 722  say what  this brush is my new best friend  i didnt get any finger burns from lava hot hair i even picked out a few stray hairs from the brush while it was on and it didnt burn me what is this sorcery  this brush is amazing and i kind of want to kiss it  if i never buy another hair appliance again i will be totally ok with that  i love this thing almost as much as i love my first kindle
i have a 6mo old and a 3yr old and have one of these germguardian sanitizers in each of their rooms we hardly every get sick i would like to think these sanitizers play a part in that they make just enough noise to act as a noisemaker as well as put off just enough light to act as a night light very dim one they seem to do a decent deal for removing odor baby diapers from their roomsi have had one of these sanitizers in my older kids room for about a year and half and it is still working great had to replace the bulb once i got a really good deal on the ones i bought on amazon most of the time they are overpriced so wait and you can get a decent deal on these sanitizers if the price drops again i will get one for my room
i knew the items included in this package would be small and they sure were  but it is a nice selection of things to try and then i could purchase bigger products of the things i liked the best  it would make a nice gift also for someone who likes to mess with their nails

great for travel and to keep things organized at home
fast shipping and great product
this is one longlasting unit  it has taken on some small room issues  vocs other odors  and puts out a very very insignificant green light  ive used it in powder rooms and most recently a college students bedroom that has accumulated dirty laundry  very pleased with this purchase and am about to buy another oneive tried several negativeion generators some with  without fans some ozone generators etc for several years and have found that those with filtersfans tend to die after a few years of constant use even with filter maintenance  the fans of these units not the germguardian tend to finally die  the smaller ozone generators are wonderful but ive found that some of the brands are all but impossible to clean and thusly lose their effectiveness after a year or so  the one of these small units im still crazy about isnt being sold by amazon at this time   
good detergent great value we purchased it to try to get a stain out of a pocelain sink it didnt help with that but it is a wonderful laundry dey
same as i was using
great price for two and does the job
my kids love them and im quite sure well continue to use them into adulthood  i should  buy stock
i wish this product  was available years ago this is the most amazing product for mosquito bites im the one thats bit  in my family im always getting bit and scratch like crazy if you use this right away you too will be  amazed that it worked so well the itching will be gone there was still swelling but it did not itch its so simple to use i actually have the original namebrand one and i prefer this one better because the finger loops make it easier to use i cannot say enough positive things about this product the price is excellent  especially since you get three of them i keep one on my purse and one in the car and another in the first aid kit this is one purchase you will not regret
this is not a production unit  its a portable easily transportable light weight simple fairly durable unit  for a homeowner handyman or light commercial its very nice  im an electrician for the low end carpentry i need to do my work this is perfect
love it 
it was a gift so i dont know details but it was a pretty color
ive done some research on the health benefits of fisetin but cant really find a lot about it  it hasnt had many studies and the results of the ones done werent very conclusive  but the reason i selected this product for review was not for the fisetin content but the quercetin  quercetin is absolutely wonderful at getting zinc into cells to fight off and kill viruses  it really goes very well with vitamin c d3 and zinc and i take all of those daily
great product
i got a free sample of the dragonfruit flavor it tastes like how a bandaid smells i cant think of how else to describe it i didnt realize it was a healthy drink when i popped the can open and just thought it was another brand of lacroixesque sparkling waters after the first foul tasting sip i looked at the can to see exactly what i was drinking after seeing that it claims to be good for you i decided to give it another go i couldnt get past sip number 2 truly one of the worst tasting beverages ive tasted
ever since the pandemic began we have been taking d3 pills religiously however not all of them are created equal these are very good however and are easy to swallow leave no bad aftertaste in your mouth and are small enough they dont choke the mrs most of all they are strong enough 5000ius to keep pretty much any nasty germ at bay granted its not guaranteed to prevent you from catching covid but every little bit helps right we havent gotten the virus yet knock on wood so we will maintain our regime and take these for as long as it takes to be safe again good health to you
i fell several weeks ago and hurt my seat but consequently my legs hurt since then too  i bought this to help cushion my seat at work but its thick and hurts my legs on the edge  i have to return the item because it wasnt comfortable for me
seriously im writing a review about ear plugs theyre that great i have very sensitive hearing and even moderate noise sometimes makes my eardrums hurt i always carry one pair of these around with me keep one in the car etc just in case i need them theyre very comfortable and dont get irritating they cancel enough noise that i can feel at ease enough sleep but if i wear them loosely i could still have a conversation with someone at dinner they are fairly discrete and the little cases are great too ive used these for almost a year now whether its sitting in a coffee shop or traveling on a plane if you are in the market for ear plugs look no further seriously these are awesome and so comfy
i did a bit of research after one of the morning news shows talked about uv lights this little plugin was pretty inexpensive so i ordered it for an area that has puppy pads it did the job and was pretty quiet its nice to know that the uv bulb is replaceablei just ordered another one to place in the bathroomupdate it was pointed out to me that the plug turns so it can accommodate both sides of an outlet thanks to merry c
loved the idea off having earplugs attached to a cord for easy access but plug come out and wont go back in i cant really notice a huge noise difference between these and regular ear plugs my voice and the patients is very muffled i have to take off my gloves after using the cavitron to hold a conversation
just what i needed
its an okay ice pack gets too hard once in freezer for more than a couple hours not my favorite
fast results that are clear no dye run issues
i bought this some time ago as an amazon today deal this is such a wonderful spray i could not afford the 29 dollars but it is worth every cent here is hoping for another todays deal
i really like these lens cleaners the moisture is perfect they dont leave my lenses with streaks ive tried other wipes and they left streaks on my lenses because they were too wet
the lavender smells amazing  i love the little towel that comes with it  great investment for your mat
i have used these several times now it fully blocks the light while being very conformable  it worked for me laying down in bed and sitting up on a very early flight it let me get the best sleep i have ever had on a plane the soft silk does not add any distraction like other sleep masks i have tried
like most stain removers this one works best on fresh stains  for example if you just spilled wine on your blouse five minutes ago this remover worked but then so does seltzer if you apply enough of it when i tried it on an old stain a pair of jeans that had a spot on it from grease it didnt do anything the small bottle is handy for travel however so its good for when youre on the go overall its good for mild stains that just happened and you dont have anything else on hand for more stubborn stains id use something else
makes nice bubbles and the message is good
but it isnt waterproof so your medication could melt away if you get caught in rain it will work and most of us arent caught in the rain all day everyday so they can work you could also put little mouth fresheners or gum in them too when open you also have a mirror bright interior lid to look in for fast fix ups
i felt very hard to use and plucks hair
great supply of various popular sizes of watch band pins
the four pack of bamboo bath sponges are a great deal i go through a few every year and this fourpack will keep me stocked soft mesh and shower gel foams up nicely when using they have a nice ribbon to hook them for draining
good quality and good price  good for adults and children
does not work almost seemed to attract more cats i would not recommend buying this
i use it for everything its the best
this type of supplement is very good for you and the supplier is awesome you can curb your appetite have clean skin and have your hair grow very long from using this
i am always looking for ways to curb my appetite so i thought i would give these a try you are to take so many pills each day i think that is hard to remember to take them and with the smell it is hard to force yourself to do but i was determined to give it a fair shake i did take them for a week and i did notice that it helped my appetite i am not sure if that is because of what is in them or because of the terrible smell who wants to eat after you have smelled that it did work though so you have to give some stars for that i defiantly noticed that i was going to the bathroom more often do the detox part worked as well this is not something i could add or take for my regular routine but if you are looking for a way to loose a few pounds or a way to detox for  a week or so this would work
the first thing i love about this flat iron is that its cordless  its so nice to slowly getting rid of all of the power cords in my bathroomsthe iron itself is nice  heats up fastthe only thing i dont like is the size of the heating plate  im used to a longer one in my older flat iron so its taking me a bit to get used to this onesince i only straighten my bangs and every so often my entire head of hair the charge will last me a long time before i need to recharge it againnice flat iron thats easy to pack up and take on the go
i love these oil but they raised the price  this is not greasy and good for skin  great for senaitive skin
pretty rough and started to unravel on second use pretty color but thats about it 
does not plug in the wall properly
i mixed up some of this today with cold water and milk with some ice cubes  it mixed very well  i gave my wife a taste she is pickier than i am on these things  she liked it  we both liked iti appreciate very much that it is made in the usa  i really appreciate the grams of fiber along with added vitaminsthe only concern i have is the price to reorder when it runs out  at almost two dollars a serving it is higher than the others i drink  but then again this one has fiber and i dont think any of my other ones dowe like it and will continue to drink it
ridiculous  1 sheet will not wash anything  use 15 sheets maybe
i have been using this clear care product to clean and disinfect my contacts for years  it was recommended to me by my eye doctor when i was diagnosed with an eye infection i have not had an infection in the many years i have been using it i gave it 4 stars because the double pack only comes with one of the required cases i think there should be a case for each bottle included
very deceiving as there was nothing stating that they would poorly paint rubber and glue it to mediocre glass
well packaged arrived early great price and smells lovely
there are 30 shimmery champagne gold boxes and 6 pages of 20 clear stickers totaling 120 stickers that come with this set they come in one piece and fold into a midsized boxi finally figured out how to fold the box bottom correctly the tabbed flaps go on the outside of the bottom and interlock into the other flaps they are not very sturdy so i suspect that 4 of the 120 stickers should be used to secure the 4 tabs as shown in one of my photosas long as one seals the bottom it should hold these are perfect for christmas gifts no wrapping needed or for cookies cupcakes or other classy gifts  each box should be able to fit about one pound of cookies depending on the size of the cookie or four regularsized cupcakes overall i think these are classy but i do not like the interlocking design of the bottom that requires stickers to provide holdthe current price of 1899 for 30 comes to  63 cents each which is reasonable
when i read this book in the future back when it hasnt been published yet it changed my life  but seriously i already know i will love this book when it becomes available thank you allie for hyperbole and a half and all things created by your wonderful self im super excited to see the new book hope youre doing well
i saw no change with the whitening pen it does have a pleasant taste doesnt work for me
i purchased this toner a few weeks ago i was looking for something that hydrated my skin some toners dry your face out not this one my face felt moist and clean dreamy
great for layout
the spray nozzle does not spray evenly and leaks huge globs of the oil out on to my matit takes a ton of spraying to even cover your mat so i feel like this is going to last maybe 57 usesthe smell is nice and i like that it comes with a microfiber towel but the towel itself is hideous and too bigoverall i do not recommend this product
the packaging was different than what is pictured but i really like the fragrance and the way it lathers  i would love to see it packaged in a glass jar  more for the aesthetic look
ive been using cloverine salve since i was born well my mom did it for me 3 generations cant be wrong  i use it on practically everything except burns until the healing process has started get some its so worth it
they are bgreatbfor the price
this is the chair pad if you sit longer than 10 min per day especially using a computer its well worth the high price for what you get  how it keeps its original shape  form factor over a long period of time
i received cascade complete as listed in the product description  good product
rather wobbily
attachments stopped working g after one use
i ordered some generic eyeglass case from amazon and my gunnar mlg phantoms did not fit in them in the slightest  didnt even know gunnar made an accompanying case but im very happy i stumbled upon these  the quality seems very good theyre made with something like a hard leatherette so it gives it a nice feel  plenty of room inside and i dont feel like my glasses are squished  im considering buying another pair of gunnars and if i do i am absolutely buying another one of these with them
this is a good quality vg for mixing eliquid  ive used this in the past and am quite pleased with it for the price
i like to walk around the neighborhood and pick up trash and this thing is great  i can walk with a bag and a grabber hand and easily keep the bag open to put stuff in it  then it collapses on itself when you let it drop back down like a briefcase so trash doesnt blow out
there fine
in addition to this new linea squeegee i have three oxo shower squeegees two of which are in service at any given time  my favorite  i have been using my  oxo squeegees anywhere from twice daily to once every other day depending on which shower im using and if im taking one or two showers per daythis unit comes in three piecesthe suction cup which has to be screwed into the stainless steel holder the stainless steel holder and the squeegee its features are partial crystallike handle rust proof stainless steel in brushed nickel finish for top of squeegee and suction hook slightly angled neckpros it has a long 10 blade so its great for wiping down my shower walls in a few passes the streamlined design looks sleek and elegant except for the lucitelooking handle the blade wipes smoothly and leaves my walls and shower doors streakfree the suction cup holds hard on my acrylic shower walls the blade appears to be replaceable by loosening two screws it comes with lifetime limited warranty guaranteed rustproof finish will replace if defective etccons to me this is heavy as it weighs in at 65 ounces excluding suction holder the handle looks like lucite or glass and if the suction cup gives way when its hanging i expect it to break when it hits the tub or shower bottom in fact the weight of this thing might nick the bottom of a porcelain tub only time will tell how this holds up the handle is too thin for grasping comfortably i wish the blade head were a little more angledcompared to my other squeegees i actually like this one the least mainly because of the thin fragile handle and the lack of a deeper angled headif i were to rate my preference in squeegees my first choice is the    47 stars and the   this squeegee  i rate 3 stars because the handle needs to be thicker and in stainless steel and the head more angled at the current price of 3999 plus 525 shipping i feel this is overpriced for its current design  nevertheless this squeegee is a looker and for those who have very large showers and baths this 10 blade makes short work of wiping away the water
great task lighting with two slightly different settings adjustable for most positions next to a chair hope the replacement bulb is reasonable when necessary

my daughter is a soccer champ in her own right but megan is her favorite she loves it i do wish they came with a simple stand
unfortunately im returning this item i tried it on and it was fairly simple to figure out how to adjust it it definitely felt like it was pulling my shoulders back and i could instantly feel a bit of relief from my poor posture however once on and snug it cuts into my arm pit area too tightly it may be my size or my sensitivity level im a female 5 1 and weigh about 125 i dont not recommend this product since it seems like it would be effective it just wasnt for me
for years i have heard about the magic eraser  from friends and family even coworkers  not sure what took me so long to try it out but when i did all i can say is wow  i had embedded stains from makeup and who knows what on the bathroom corian sink which i scrubbed with baking soda even softscrub with bleach and the stains didnt come all the way out  one try with the magic eraser and bam  stains gone  then i decided to try it on the black toaster oven where i accidentally left a loaf of bread and the plastic melted into the top  i washed it rubbed it and used everything i could think of but that thin layer of plastic wouldnt budge  in comes the magic eraser and it came off right away  no kidding  the name says it all because this stuff is truly magic
it did a nice enough job
i love this diaper print its so cute otb
i have to have electrolytes when playing tennis i play very competitively especially during the summer months when its very hot here in the deep south if i dont have an electrolyte drink available during a match i start getting the shakes and afterwards i am prone to muscle cramping which hurts like youknowwhat i have tasted these electrolyte drops and they taste fine in water but i havent been able to test it out on a hot court since its still winter but looking at the ingredients list it seems to have everything i need and more i especially like the extra potassium it contains  and i usually have to add a little nacl to it since i sweat so much of it out while playing but i probably wont have to because it contains 125mg of sodium per serving  im really looking forward to using this electrolyte come this spring and summer

i absolutely love love love this hat i was not sure if i would as i am generally not a hat person i have very fare skin however and wanted to see if a hat would work to protect me from the sun this year while working in the garden and this hat is going to be perfect and for an added bonus my hubby actually likes it on me i think it will also look super cute with a little sun dress to go out  i am only in my early 30s so its still fashionable not something for just your grandma but something you can add to your closet for summer days anywherei received the vefra summer large brim straw hat for women for free in order to conduct this review and provide my honest option of this item

garcinia cambogia is a small sour tropical fruit used traditionally as a condiment and to prevent formation and increase release of intestinal gas  this herb used as natural appetite suppressant aids in weight management and does not taste bad  i mix it in with my yogurt and shakes  hopefully it will help me loose weight  ive taken for 2 days now 3 doses total and i already have more energy and notice a suppression in my appetite
i was not expecting the large size of this this will not fit most rolling papers only extra long ones i ended up purchasing a smaller 125 size that fits most papers the product was great quality just not what i was looking for make sure you are paying attention to the size it was delivered quickly and as listed
i ordered the dental duty teeth whitening kit with 14 nonslip whitestrips  whitening accelerator light for review  i have had the opportunity to review several other whitening kits recently and this one by far has given my wife the best results  she has completed six 20minute sessions and already has had significant results  her additional thoughts compared to whitening pens or other trays these are much easier to use  you simply open the strips place the larger strip on your top teeth and the smaller strip on your bottom teeth  be sure to get all the way down to your gums and press the strip to adhere closely to your teeth  then insert the light into the mouth tray and turn it on the light has an automatic shut off at 10 minutes  just turn it back on once or twice dependent on the time you want to continue whitening  i would not recommend nor does the instructions recommend any longer than a half hour you do need to open the battery compartment to remove the paper between the two batteries to use it the photos show her before pic along with after the first use and then after 6 uses  the pictures were taken in the same spot in the house at the same time of day without a flash because these are strips versus a gel you do not have anything draining into your mouth while you are whitening  once you turn off the light and remove the tray there is some saliva mixed with white foam  she did not gag as much as with the gels it may be too early to tell but at this point this product has not caused any additional sensitivity to her teeth this kit is less expensive then many other less comparable whitening kitsoverall my wife is happy with the results she has seen already  she is looking forward to finishing a complete week once she does i will update my review with new after pictures
okay the flavor on this one is intense  its strong enough that i find i dont want to chew it very long  to me thats much better than the usual weak flavor but is something to consider if you dont like a strong flavor  the flavor sticks around awhilethe packaging is recyclable i use them for storing small craft items in
i have seen others use these and they seem quite happy with them so i needed one because i am so uncomfortable on planes i am looking forward to using this when you take a plane for over just a few hours you really would like to sleep this should help me especially since it also has an eye mask and noise plugs
this is the second time i have bought bath booms the first time was lush which was great but expensive so i decided to try another one then i found ikalula i like ikalula bath booms they have sweety smells and different colors i love sweet orange most i love all orange and lemon smells they make my skin soft and make me relax after i bath i will buy it again

tried it on a window and a wreath and it is a yucky mess  never dried  stayed wet
i received this product and promptly put it in the refrigerator for twenty four hours or so i took one out noticing the easy open label on the top it actually was the plastic covering peels off with minimal effort and i think just about anyone will be able to twist the top off   unfortunately ive drank some bad things before ive even had spoiled beer that had unidentifiable chunks floating in it this was that bad it was revolting chalky and bitter with a horrible chemical sour twang i had two mouthfuls and i was still tasting this hours later yes i ate and drank other things to try and get rid of the taste but it lingered hands down this was the most revolting thing i have ever drank tossed the other five bottles in the trash i do not recommend this product unless you dont like someone a lot
use this product for long runs its great
brew it with hot water it helps with lung cleaning
ive enjoyed the premade version so reading the powdered version wasnt the same didnt surprise me but a lot of reviews claim it tastes terrible and was so different they threw it away luckily i trusted the company and tried this product anyway contrary to those lowstar reviews i disagree that it doesnt taste similar and when mixed in a blender you almost cant tell the difference i use a small portable version  just using a shaker cup doesnt blend it as successfully but ok if you just need that satisfying shake to stave off snack cravings i find this meal replacement to be very satisfying and helps stop me from craving excess food i do 2 scoops to actually replace a meal 1 scoop to stave off snacking note the container says 12 c is for 8oz  23 c 2 scoops is for 12 oz not as creamy as the premade but probably not as many additives either unfortunately ive realized this product causes stomach discomfort so i cant enjoy it as often as i would like if you pop and enzyme pill and a probiotic pill just before it helps a lot with the gas
a month ago my blood pressure was 14080 i had atrial flutter issues and my heart was acting bizarre i started taking a potassium and magnesium product and saw some results then i read the magnesium miracle by dr carolyn dean and stated taking this liquid magnesium i noticed good results with magnesium and now my blood pressure went down to 11060 so my nurse practitioner has halved my blood pressure medication and i have an appointment in a month to check it againif you do take this liquid magnesium and have high blood pressure make sure you are working with your doctor or nurse because your medication may need to be adjusted they also did an ekg on me and said my heart was normal and i told them well im taking magnesium they also did blood tests and said they were normal im not sure my nurse actually realized that the magnesium had lowered my blood pressure here are some of my experiences day by day at the startday 1 i took 14 teaspoon in 169 fluid ounces water it made me feel relaxed and i slept wellday 2 i got ambitious and took 12 teaspoon in a large container of iced tea and it only tasted a bit saltysipped over a couple of hours and it seemed to relax me and take the edge off my anxiety i thought it was giving me a lot of energy and made my heart beats really strongday 3 backed off a bit and took 14 teaspoon in a small amount of cranberry juice tasted salty and a bit bitter so didnt want to do that again decided it needed more liquid to make it palatableday 4 took 14 teaspoon in a pint 2 cups of coconut water my anxious thoughts stopped and my mind felt calm and almost as if my thoughts were not as loudday 5 took 14 teaspoon in 2 cups bottled water felt as if my system was detoxing and cleaning outday 6 felt like toxins were being released so drank more waterday 7 decided to try taking the magnesium liquid in capsules that way you cant taste and salty or bitter flavorday 8 while waiting to get capsules took 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in iced teaday 9 put 14 teaspoon magnesium in 3 veggie capsules swallowed them down with no issuessince then ive been taking 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in five veggie capsules i fill them up with a syringe and take them right away not letting them sit around to dissolve it is a little extra effort but it keeps my atrial flutter under control and i feel better in general you may want to wipe the capsules off a bit after filling i just use a napkin that way you dont taste any of the liquid that is my best solution and how im going to continue to take this magnesiummy cautions are to start slow with drops or 14 teaspoon and work up slowly to 12 teaspoon a day also read the magnesium miracle to understand all the reasons to take this product and how to take it i would not recommend taking it straight always dilute it in at least 2 or more cups of water to make it palatable i will say this magnesium does not have laxative effects like other magnesium products do that is a good thing if you want to leave the houseso my experience has been positive please consult with your doctor before taking any supplements as your medications may need to be adjustedthe rebecca review

looking through the clear bag when my kale powder arrived the shade of the green powder is a bit pale compared to the color of fresh kalebut curious to taste it i added a teaspoon of powder to a 12 glass of water and just drank itsurprisingly it tasted fresh and sweet  im just hoping this is truly what it says it ispure organic kale powder and nothing else  this tastes far better than so many green powders ive purchased  no bitterness whatsoever i feel this was a very good purchase  i bought the pound bagwhich will probably last a long time

i bought this to begin tincturing my own stevia that i grow in my garden  ive tried using alcohol and cant ever seem to cook it right to get ride of the taste  someone recommended glycerin so im giving it a shot im so excited to taste my first sample soon  everyone says this has a sweet taste but i didnt find thatof course i have a serious sweet toothso i cant taste mildly sweet i guess  its a large bottle for the pricei will be saving a tremendous amount of money by making my own tinctures at home  this process also doesnt require heatyou just mix it with the herb so easy  im looking for more ways to use this as a viable source for homemade items  you know what is in the product if you make it at home
this trimmer started out as a very nice trimmer  however after only a year the main trimmer head has broken rendering the unit mostly useless  while it worked great for the year i used it about once per month the trimmer head i use most of the time is broken and unusable  i find this to be very disappointing  the quality of this unit is very poor and one year of use for a unit of this costly makes me angry
very light and very short even with the telescopic handle

as a guy exfoliating the skin is not an easy task and sometimes i get lazy maybe most of the time to be honest but after using the body bar for the first time  i was hooked i purchased the the body bar  exfoliating body scrub loofah  moisturizing body wash soap 2 in 1 by bathing beauty the body bar works amazingly well and the after effect with the shea butter aloe  vitamin e nourish and moisturize skin it gently exfoliate the skin while deep cleansing great for everyday skin care and all skin types i highly recommend this product for guys and girls
i got this hoping that it would take care of a stress incontinent problem that i sometimes have but have use 5 of them and still have not found it to take complete care of the problem  maybe i was expecting too much  will keep trying to see if 34user error34 is a reason for the product failure that i have experienced
i use essential oils by themselves before my yoga practice and typically choose ones not diluted in a carrier oil even then the scent only lasts about ten minutesthis combination is just wonderful clean fresh uplifting and balancinggreat for men and women as its not florali put it on both wrists and found myself being drawn to its unique blend theres something really captivating about it energizing yet soothing
happy that it comes with a small booklet on how to stretch with it rolling my back on this and hamstrings feels great does a great job of decompressing spine glad i went with this product really hope it does not chip or damage easily
these are packaged up really cute thats pretty much where the positives end they smell rather gross and all smell basically the same if they get too wet they just disintegrate and disappear in seconds there is very little scent released in fact i couldnt smell them at all while in the shower after i got out i caught a whiff of very faint scent but thats it totally not worth it
these are the best shower scrubs ive ever used  i love them this is my second purchaseof these they are exfoliating but soft and they larger up very nicely without falling apart great deal
love it really helps with pain and strain
no more powerful than the battery version  if you are getting this because you love the battery powered one and want a little extra power dont waste your money  it is a wall plug in with a cord but it is an adapter and is really not better than the first one i got that uses batteries i sent it back  i do really like the battery version
the daily supplements are great to take and hard to miss theyre somewhat larger than normal and very condensed at that theyre easily the largest pill i have to take as a supplement that is not chewable
even nicer in person than the photos would definitely give as a gift super cute
this product is fine so long as its used properly obviously this is my fault for not being extra careful mixed up my regular solution with this bottle and lord well you can see what happened yes it says on the label not to put in eye like that but the packages i think needs to change as it looks to much like normal solution after research ive seen this has happened to others as well i just wanted to warn people about being extra extra careful
good supplement best vitamin c ive found thus far

i am in my late 40s and cant see up close without my reading glasses i recently purchased a vanity mirror for my bathroom with 5x magnification i was horrified with what i saw the wrinkles didnt bother me  that goes along with age but i have lots of blackheads on my temples i couldnt see them before i have used the acne tools  the ones that look like dental tools and they work okay but those often leave behind temporary redness and you have to be precise about the location because of the small tips i found this ultrasonic cordless skin scrubber to be much more effective at getting rid of the blackheads and it doesnt leave behind any redness the end of it is about an inch and a half wide and it is able to scrape out the ugly blackheads you can see the dirt and grime on the tip after youve used it gross now as far as the scrubber goes it comes with a charger once it is on it has a vibration thing going on it heats up a little bit but not to the point where it is too hot to use or it burns i just can feel a little heat from it while it is in use theres a silicone cover to go over the metal end when it is not in use i am thrilled to have found thisi received this for free in exchange for my honest amp unbiased review my thoughts amp opinions are my own
good product
great taste and value i highly recommend these to keep whole familys immune system strong during these uncertain times
as advertised very useful
i really like magic eraser and it has helped make products come clean when before there was no hope since this product came out ive tried the 100 imitations that worked but crumbled in the process so i went back to the original and i am not too happy i used this to get scuff marks off my daughters sneakers and true thats a big task but it crumbled and much more elbow grease was needed than i remember i think that the ones with the blue scrubber side are better  ill try them next time
this stuff has a very strong fruity medicinal odor its not horrible but its so strong that a few squirts in the shower fills the whole house with the smell it seems to leave the shower glass clean and clear but ive used other daily products that worked better and didnt smell so much i wont be buying this again
this sandalwood oil smells wonderful i love it it is not overpoweringly strong but it is strong enough to be smelled across the room it also comes in a large leak proof glass bottle with a dropper included
tastes like battery acid and dried puke  just pay the extra money and get the capsulesim no ninny when it comes to choking down gross powders but glucosamine sulfate tastes like satan himself pissed in a pool of battery acid and drain cleaner then dried it out and sold it as a joint supplement
i absolutely love these masks the design and colors are attractive to me the material is thick and layered and they are comfortable to wear these are perfect for the fall or the winter they are made of 100 cotton and the current price of 1499 for these two masks are a reasonable price at 750 each
offering a 2 pack works well when there are multiple users in the household this product also states that it contains the mother which apparently is the more effective type of acv to take so far i have taken acv with as well as without and havent had any noticeable differences it has helped to regulate our digestive tract for both my husband and i but no weight loss benefits we are both mature seniors which i am sure makes a difference with weight loss benefits the taste is comparable slightly sweet with a mild acv hint the size is smaller than most the directions need clarity2 or 3
use this product to help with restless legs seems to work well and for the price its better than picking up at the grocery store
this blackhead remover vacuum is amazing it has an app that you can download to access the 20x magnifying camera so that you can see it actually helping your skin its kind of cool to actually watch the blackheads whiteheads and makeup particles being removed from your skin it has great suction power its easy to use and takes less than three minutes to finish your entire face its made well and is durable and seems to be long lasting this makes a great gift im very happy with this purchase great value

if you have small glasses like mine it can be hard to find clipon sunglasses these work perfectly you might need to bend the outer clips to get them to fit over thick lenses but thats no big deal note that the sunglass coating does scratch relatively easy so keep them protected when not in use

one squirt is all you need to cover up bathroom odors  not loaded up with chemicals and fake smellsand one squirt means it lasts far longer than all the other sprays
for a basic eye mask of this style it is attractive budget friendly and are well made blocks out light via not only the outer material but also an internal piece of flannel stitched in im not sure why it has a pocket nothing to come out perhaps to add your own additional padding or black out material no ideanot adjustable but there is a lot of stretch how loose or tight this fits depends on your head i think it would be easy enough to make an adjustment to smaller size with a couple of quick stitches and i am not one to sew  i like that it isnt adjustable because usually the adjustable part snags my hair or i can feel it against my headhowever it being a little large to start is good because i have a large head my head measures 2375 this fits me without feeling too snug most feel way too snug but at some point in night i didnt like the feel not sure why yetmaterial is nice stitching is good comfortable when first on over course of night i could feel some pressure i eventually took it off i think these will be used for the occasional nap or when i need to just rest my eyes for me i think the pressure is due to the use of slim elastic and the opening to that pocket area i can just feel it at some point most all eye masks use slim elastic and what it does for me is create pressure across eye area where it pulls on the material through there but since this isnt too snug feeling i think it has more to do with that crease where the pocket it more material to smash against my faceso initially comfortable but then turns uncomfortable your experience may varyquality overall seems fine love the 3 pack love the floral design of the ones i selected it just isnt quite for me sadly ill try it a few more times if i experience anything else i will let you know in the mean time these are just ok hence 3 starsoddly my favorite sleep mask is one that no one else seems to like lol i keep waiting for it to come back so i can buy another or maybe i will figure out a way to make one for myself i am linking it in case you too have a big head and are bothered by the pressure of the slim elastic or at very least can see what i mean by largewide elastichttpswwwamazoncomdpb07rjqgv61
they look nice but they are hard to put on and they dont stay up too tight for me i prefer the 1020 mmhg
full disclosure i totally thought this was a joke i saw the image in the description of the ironic hipster holding a green smoothie and thought this was a 34soylent green34 type gag gift for your literary friends who like a dark joke turns out this is actually a legit meal replacement powder boy i feel silly having a giant tub of neutral flavored slim fast sitting on the counter forever now
nice plates  napkins for a birthday celebration
these are fantastic
its essentially a velcrostrap waistband with a gel pack inside for heat or cold therapy i ordered this to replace an old one i had that was no longer usable this wrap is a quality product and comes with a gel pack that is much larger than the old one i was using which is great you can also place smaller gel packs in the pocket if you wish but so far ive found the larger gel pack that comes with it to be preferable works great for lower back pain gives relief in just a few minutes easy to put on and remove as well there are lots of these for sale here but this one is exceptionally good in my opinion
nice lemony smell and taste if any easy to take
this is a great case for purse or briefcase comes in handy on a belt for outdoor hikeswould recommend for sure

this cordless auto curler is horrible it did not have instructions for how to put my hair into the curler so i watched a video of a similar curler i put a small piece of my freshly washed combed hair over the section to curl my hair i pushed the button to curl my hair the section that rotates in the middle grabbed my hair but not all of it at once my hair got caught in the curler and i had to pull it to get my hair out it damaged my hairthe box comes with a curler a base and a power cord it has vague instructions when it comes to actually put your hair into the curler it does have instructions on the different settingsi will not be recommending this cordless auto curler to family friends or even enemies
bought it for my son and he didnt want to tell me that there was something wrong with the charging cord or battery  i still havent heard back from the seller

this filter is working fairly well in our shower  hubs isnt tall so it didnt affect him but i am tall and it comes to just a an inch or so above my head  i can still take a shower but the shower spray is not as diffuse as before  installing the filter was basically a nobrainer  take off shower head install filter apparatus even plumbing tape is included put shower head back on  we dont have a hard water problem here but i like knowing a lot of chemicals are being filtered out  i dont know how long these filters will last but i will be ordering more just to have on hand

i am happy with the way this clipper cuts and the feature to be able to store clippings and emptyhoweveri thought that i was getting two different size clippers one for finger nails and one for toe nails that would be a larger size butthey are both the same sizei havent tried yet to see if they can cut toe nails easily or notthere werent any directions on how to empty but i figured it out just pull off the purple plastic coveringeasy
this product is great but i was a little upset that the batteries do not work continuouslyalmost like there is a short in the battery compartment
color is good  stays secure in pocket  thats all that matters
i would give this less stars if i could stay far far away
too bulky to be woren as a necklace i thought the stones were going to be small and suitable to be worn on the neck they are too heavy on the neck btw i am 6ft tall and muscular
there are 20 gallonsized plastic storage bags in this box and each has a slider closure the cowboys emblem takes up the entire front side of the bag as can be seen in the attached picturewhat i like about these is that they expand at the bottom in the picture the bag contains two 1763 ounce containers of marcona almonds and i had room to spare  the expandable bottom ensured that these stand up on their own  overall i really like these they do feel a bit thinner than other ziploc bags but not so thin that it matters muchthese are great for storing nuts cheese crayons a wet bathing suit and anything else that can fit into a onegallon bag at the current price of 999 this comes to 50 cents per bag
these were terrible neither my husband or myself could wear them they were so uncomfortable  could not be adjusted in any way to be comfortable
fantastic just what i needed thank you
our goto balm for most things baby bums scratches cuts chapped lips and hands so many uses
if your mask hurts your ears or is too tight this is for you it is an earsaver package of silicone extenders and ear savers i like that they are adjustable for those of us with really long hair it is nice to put the strap along the back of our neck
id give 5 stars but this does not moisturize very well need to reapply often ive been looking for a good vegan lip balm that works as well as burts bees but this isnt it unfortunately
easy to use gloves and helpful with washing dishes i was concerned about the size as i have small hands and these are one size but the kinda hug your hand even if they are bigger then id need they stay on well
they work great i had trouble before i ordered these strips my mask would not stay n my head i ordered these connecting strips and im very happy 
i have used milk thistle in a capsule form in a tea form and in a glycerite but never in powdered form  i mixed some into some warm soup and in a smoothie and found it a great way to use it  i know it discusses baking with it but im pretty sure at those temperatures you would be compromising all of the antioxidants they take such care in preserving so i dont recommend it  i liked that it was organic gmo free and packaged well in a resealable bag  i felt it was a good value for the amount of the product you get in the bag
they arent terrible with such a small amount i can gulp it down quickly i actually had to go to look up what predigested hydrolyzed protein was it is protein that has been reduced to the amino level at that level it is considered predigested and more easily absorbed
it works ok  nothing replaces goddards it was uniquely effective
i really like these but i took off one star because they are very heavy
i do well in it did work pretty well not sure if ill buy again
these fg clean wipes are great for cleaning so many things and have so many other uses as well they clean very well without harsh chemicals and without leaving any lint behind they dont tear apart like paper towels they are more like thin indestructible fiber clothsive kept one in my oil box and have been using it for several days to clean my essential oil diffusers just washing them with soap and water doesnt get all of the residual oils out but these cloths do im sure that one cloth will last for quite a while im also keeping one on my nail table to wipe my brushes clean when using poly gels and other liquids if i get anything on it i can shake it off in the trash and put it in my led lamp so the polish or polygel can cure and i can continue using it as long as possible ive taped one to the inside of my new led nail lamp so that the bottom of it doesnt get dirty with polish or other nail enhancement liquids or gels ive used a couple of them to do a quick clean of my refrigerator inside and outi know im missing some things but theyre just so many uses for them these are wonderful cloths and i absolutely recommend them
i normally wouldnt rate tissue but these are fabulous  shouldve gotten earlier in the year  these are so soft and heavy wmoisturizing  soon as you touch one you will feel the difference seriously  absorbent and can also use to take off makeupespecially that old mascara under yr eyes   these come in cube boxes which are better suited to my house and how many ppl need a box in their rms  getting 1 big box at a time is a time  my energy saver too in the long run  could of used these for our summerfall allergies poor noses
the only bag out of the three that has any major decoration is the red one in the center which has the more 343d34 stockings the other two are simple and have no 34pop out34 decorating they are simple and boring and would cost 2 at any store this is not worth the 12 i paid
i bought these for a home office because i could not see the yellow highlighter on my paperwork under the light from warm cfls  definitely a much whiter light than you might be used to the gas station minimart look that another reviewer mentioned but you can get excellent results if you put one of these and one warm cfl in a 2bulb fixture theyre the same size as a generic 100w light bulb so they fit any fixture but note that they are a bit slower than most cfls to come up to full brightness maybe 30 seconds or sobeware the miserable factory packaging a tightfitting cardboard box with zero padding  i ordered a 2pack which arrived with one bulb broken amazon took them back and sent a replacement and again one bulb arrived broken  im going to get a third package but this time ill hold on to the one good bulb so i can send back two broken ones assuming they dont send me two broken bulbs which is a distinct possibility  this is despite plenty of airbag packaging from amazon  i suspect theyre being busted further up the supply chaincompared to costcos 8pack prices on warm cfls these are relatively expensive but with 50 losses in shipment i suppose they have to charge twice as much
i did not like the feeling of these straws on my tongue theyre not perfectly smooth im not going to use these straws
absolutely love this was a bit hesitant about it using the cordless feature but it held a strong charge for the entire process of grooming my extremely fluffy dog love that it came with different clipper  settings  nail clipper and file comb and sharp scissors be aware it does not have the outlet adapter but u can plug as its a usb charger and i just used my iphone plug to charge it  its also not too loud and my dog remained calm during the process
ok so i have to say that my intended use is not what these are marketed for but the are still exactly what i needed i have some smaller fish tanks in my home and have had great difficulty in finding good cleaners for the sides of the tanks that are small enough and will not scratch these work wonderfully for the purpose the sticks are plastic not paper so they do not disintegrate and are reusable if cleaned appropriately very pleased
i live near a train yardi like having a nice background noise to sleep bythe sounds are nice but i dont use all of themi picked a favorite and that works for mea few of the sounds are a little to crisp and would be better if muffled or if the unit was at a distance perhaps in the hallway
no support at all better off getting the whole foot support
ill date myself here i have been a packers fan since vince lombardi days  lol you you can surmise i was thrilled that ziploc has packers storage bags  easy choice to make
so far so good  my husband who does smoke has had a lot of congestion since getting over a cold a couple months ago  when i was looking for an nac product this one had excellent reviews  i bought some for him a couple years ago but he complained it made him cough too much  so this time i went with 600mg  he took them twice a day with a meal to avoid stomach upset no problems there taking one at dinner time did cause him to cough a lot at nighttime thus affecting his sleep which then turned him into a bear  so he only takes one a day with his lunch and actually takes it without griping  so far he has been able to breathe much better and producing a lot more phlegm i know i know that it would be far better to just quit smoking maybe someday also these pills have no odor but for now this product is working to help him and would definitely recommend  one disappointment though was i had received a promotion from the company when i received the product for a 25 amazon gift card to apply for after using for a week  i was to go to their website and give my review to receive it  their website doesnt exist  that was a bummer  but overall happy with the results of this product so far
works great holds well
slides around too much on the bottom of my foot
i use it in the shower and like it a lot  my husband is letting me use it for awhile to see if it holds up  if it does he will get his own  update  i purchased another and both died before a year  just stopped working without any warning at all  when it worked they worked great but they die early  disappointed
there are three rollon fragrances in this set of real love citrus glow and frankincense i love the citrus glow as it has a fullbodied orange aroma the frankincense is my next favorite followed by real love which is my least favorite i cannot describe the scents of the other twoi applied each to the inside of my wrists unfortunately the fragrance does not last long at all about one hour the current price of 2499 would be competitive if these lasted longer and if i liked all three scents the citrus one is my only favorite
i got this set about a week ago and my kids eyes lit up when they saw them  the enjoy playing with them a lot  spikes on the balls are not sharp but give good sensory feeling  the ball is light squishy and bouncy and the rings are more heavy sturdy built but still have some flexibility to it  i kept one set for myself to keep at my work desk to squish  smash when im thinking or dealing with some stress  my box came with the 3 balls and 3 rings all in the same 3 colors green pink and blue  the box does show orange and yellow options so not sure if those are random or what but what i got matches the pics in the listing  when i first opened the new plastic smell was strong but a week later the smell has faded away and not a problem  overall good quality and very useful  i can see these being used and lasting a long time
you have to read the ingredients i have been drinking this tea for three days it has little if any  taste  in respiratory distress because i am allergic to oranges i have hives in my throat chokingfrom now on i will read the ingredients
i ordered this on a thursday afternoon and it was delivered about 18 hours later  however i couldnt keep this on because my arm would sweat and the band slipped off  i found it uncomfortable the velcro rubbed against my upper arm whenever i bent my arm  i am really surprised that no one has mentioned the sweating  the inside of the strap is rubber  i will be sending this back for a refund
heps to distribute weight to take pressure off sciatica comes with nice cover
arrived on time and in good condition  this works great for cleaning oil and grim off your hands  i would recommend for shops  cheaper than other brands and work better
love the aria it was easy setup and works great
very good product
i got these specifically to clean the interior of my car such as the door panels and center console i didnt realize how dirty they were until i used these
this box is gorgeous and elegant and has diamond like etchings on it it is also as sturdy as those colorful square boxes one can buy at home goods the front flap magnetically closes since it is a beautiful silver no wrapping is necessary the only problem i have is that it comes with a bow that looks like it has been run over by a truck with black marks across it  in many places see photosto set this box up all i had to do was unfold it it is one piece and unfolds into the shape shown in less than a couple of seconds there are no ugly creases just a beautiful and sturdy box that can be used repeatedly for storage or for gifting this particular version is the size of a small shoebox and will hold some lingerie or a small pair of pjs the current price of 999 1199 plus 2 off is competitive however until they fix the problem with the supplied ribbon i recommend passing on this  
good file much better than most others
used for foot stability
love my go to gentle but cleans
not heavy works great wonderful price
this brace is comfortable and it fits into my lace up tennis shoes or work shoes it stabilizes the ankle and lifts the toe which prevents fallsi have ordered 3 braces and this is the besti gave a 4 star rating only because the strap from the toe to the ankle was not holding after 5 weeks or sothe company is sending me a replacement at no charge great customer serviceupdate i changed my review to a 5 star because the company sent a new brace not just the strapexcellent customer service
loved the napkins
this product is a life saver for my dad no spills and no more risk of falling in the middle of the night when he wakes up to urinate
very high quality light i use it at my main sewing machine makes a big difference will definitely be ordering more to put at my other machines
great replacement heads and great price
yes you can buy peroxide for less money but this is mixed to a 3 strength and has a nice scent to it so it saves a lot of time and effort  does the job good disinfectant  unless you want to fool around with mixing your own id say just bite the bullet on this one
when my generic ambien doesnt work i get out of bed and take these pills then im able to get to sleep in the next fifteen to thirty minutes some nights i just take this along with my sleeping pills to give me a deeper sleep when taking these natural sleep pills i find that i sleep through the night better no waking up at odd hours of the night i also notice im less anxious about sleeping when i take two pills you are not supposed to take more than two these do contain maltodextrin if that concerns you the herbsplants in this formula include lemon balm and passionflowerthe rebecca reviewi received one free bottle for review purposes this review is my honest opinion
i love this previously i was using s tennis ball this is a lot easier id pay more for slightly higher qualify however it still works well
i put this on my sofa i ran out halfway through because you need to apply two coats the liquid is white and the bottle is white so i didnt realize it was almost empty at a glance it looked like the bottle was still full then i realized it was opaque a lot more must come out with the sprayer than i realizedhonestly i have not noticed much dirt and waterrepelling qualities i still have to use my bissel green machine to clean up spills it helps the liquid pool up without totally soaking into the upholstery but its not 100 waterproof however in exchange for that its not stiff like scotchguard or anything with the small quantity i would use it on something like dining room chairs it took too much product to cover an entire sectionali wouldnt view this as a stain prevention method but rather something that buys you time to clean it up with a stronger product
solid cool looking trimmer  comes with 3 clip on bladecomb adjustments  rechargeable lion battery it lasts for 23 hours lit indicator  single button strong cutting  trim the sideburns trim the beard eyebrows and cut designs in your hair if you want  nice gift for the guys
obviously they arent named brand heads they are generic brand from another country they are much softer and im not sure how long they will last  doubt i will buy again they did fit my clarsonic mia just fine though so no issue there
it works but i would buy it again
first  these contain soy which means i cannot touch them because im allergic to soy the other folks on our hiking trip all tried them instead why is soy required3 out 3 hated the chocolate crisp cereal bars all agreed they smell ok but taste awful theres a bit of a bitter aftertaste and a distinctly chemical type flavor to the sweetness it wasnt like a diet cola nasty but bad enough that none of the 3 would eat more than a couple of bites one time i cant give the remaining bars away
coverage is good
i really like this organic kale powder it has a subtle taste in my organic protein shakes i use it every morning along with frozen mixed berries or frozen tropical fruit i put the powder into a mason jar that makes it easier to get into without getting it all over my hand
works well on curling short hair
i discovered this at my local gymspa i love it just wish it was not sooooooo expensive  i dont understand why it is so expensive its only coconut extract id love to find something less expensiveanyone know of something similar
i take a liquid vitamin but this product made me very ill i took it with a meal and about 5 min after ingestion i became sweaty and vomited i took it 3 other different times per instructions and each time i became violently ill throwing up does youngevity have a money back guarantee
can i go lower than one star  i found these bars completely inedible and the taste vile usually when i dont like something i put it out for the various critters in our area i threw these away as i didnt want to be accused of cruelty to animals yuck
i like it one tip though  cleaning your face is not to be underestimated i broke out after using this and it was not the fault of the product rather i brought up a lot of bacteria and spread it all around my face
functions well well made good price and you get two sets
these comfortable gloves are perfect for doing dishes so your hands dont get wet with the nasty water they are comfortable durable and they look nice theyre also easy to cleanthis pack contains two of the regular gloves and two with the soft fuzzy lining
these didnt stick at all they slid down into my shoes
when you have to work from home you need to make your chair more supportive and comfortable this goes a long way to helpin
i really love the light clean smell of this cleaner
its kinda pricey but fun for tracking your weight progress currently bummed because the instructions advise that you not use this while pregnant  definitely something to keep in mind other than that it has a nice look and is super convenient for tracking weight alongside your fitbit
blows every other foot file out of the water
great quality product
keeps my house smelling wonderful lasts a long while
these adhere really well and stay put  i will definitely buy again
not good for thick hair takes a long time doing small sections at a time however curls come out very nice if you have the time
holds both of my epipens  seems pretty sturdy  i added a carabiner so i could attach it to my backpack  i like that the color stands outedit ive had my original for 6 years now and its just now starting to show wear  its held up really well  im ordering a new one to replace it and hopefully it lasts just as long  very happy with this product
works  good value for the price
taking trim probiotic for women has definitely made me feel better overall ive taken probiotics for quite a while now and i always look for ones with a high cfu 25 billion is a great number i dont think theyve made me any trimmer but i think ive had less bloating overall the serving size is one pill per day easy peasy 50 for a months supply isnt the most affordable in my opinion but i do think this is a good product
as someone that takes a lot of supplements  i was interested in adding artichoke to help with lowering cholesterol and calming a sensitive digestive systemadding artichoke is kind of a no brainer since most people tolerate it very well side effects are rare and often more of a coincidence unrelated to taking this supplementi also take tart cherry and licorice as well as a turmericginger comboepisodes of gerd are less and less fingers crossed for my next blood work
pretty good
this is a great quality probiotic strain that really can help with so many issues for me it helps with autoimmune inflammatory issues so much im really happy with how well these work
was so uncomfortable i sent it back
thought they were going to be pure  copper package states they are stainless steel
not sure why this product was even invented when any soap and water will do the same thing  i washed a green acrylic paint stained acrylicbristle brush in this and it did not get rid of very much of the green paint  i went back to my regular hand soap and hot water to get rid of most of the rest of the paint  too bad its less messy than my method but not as functional
i have been using this product for years and it surely does what it says it does i use this item daily as i have sore gums  wear dentures  i must say that benzodent does the trick
i wanted to buy a good pair of ear plugs for attending concerts and live shows which i do frequently i was torn between these and the etymotic research er20smc plugs so i ordered both they are very similar especially in terms of sound quality most wont notice a difference although i do believe i prefer the downbeats soundwisebut the dbs are far more comfortable in the ear i recently went on a trip and couldnt find my dbs so i took the etys and also realized that they are even more uncomfortable when laying unless you sleep on your back i prefer the case on the etys as it opens and closes quietly but performance and comfort are the most important qualities in ear plugs my friend also tried both and prefers the etys but only because he fears the short downbeats will get stuck somehow ha
decent boost great flavor unusual in most preworkouts will buy again
so this smells like watermelon and it smells wonderful a little goes a long way because it is a little strong but it smells delicious
they do not fizz at all not a good scent either
when i read mini dustpan i thought this one would be a little bit smaller than it is it is pretty small but i was hoping a little smaller i do like it though and it is very versatile the pan makes collecting the dirt easy the brush has a brush side on one end and a squeegee side on another this is perfect for making sure you get all the dirti like that the brush neatly stores within the pan in addition they give you a small little brush that works very well in cleaning out dirt from your keyboard or other small areas i actually use this for cleaning out the cage of my flying squirrels it makes a job that usually takes me closer to 5 to 10 minutes a 1 minute taskthe materials are also perfect that if they ever get dirty you can just clean it easily with soap and water
this is actually really easy to use the pictures are from our first attempt with a small watermelon the slices were nowhere near perfect but still it was easier than using a knife the rubber grip helps a lot if you get juice on your hands and the whole thing feels solid the melon baller was ok but would actually work better on a cantaloupe or something firmer since its a bit on the small sidei received this in return for a review its doubtful you will get picture perfect results without a lot of practice but it does make it better and easier
purchased these for my 92 yr old dad his room is tiled and these keep his feet warm and allow him to make trips to the bathroom without having to make the effort to put on slippers these are not carried in walk in stores and so thank you amazon for carrying these ive purchased over 1 doz pairs in the last few years
like this product though i had to do a trial and error to figure out the different settings  i also found out what a mask is in japan and ordered some face masks online as the result though dont use the massager with them  certainly less expensive than a few of the other options out there  the english translation in the booklet could be a little clearer
they break easily i keep getting packs that have bulbs with exposed wires and detached bases other than that they work really well perfect daylight balanced bulbs very bright i replaced my entire house with these bulbs and surprisingly my utilities bill decreased
i ordered these because they were clear not knowing they had no screw on caps  the lid is the cap and has a rubber seal so they do not leak  its just so nice not having 3 pieces floating around while they are drying in my bathroom
very firmsmooth good quality  i use as an exercise for balance  its supposed to strengthen leg muscles
has helped my husbands stomach
this lash curler has  teeth  along the silicon they seem to help with after mascara lashes it separates them and gives a more natural look really affordable and does the work comes with multiple replacement which is appreciated
i love this combination of kelp and potassium  i was feeling tired most of the time and after only using it for 2 days i can feel an increase in my energy level  excellent if you use sea salt or a salt with no iodine to replenish the iodine your body needs
little pricy but gives me the opportunity to salute the queen of bengazi every day thanks
the problem is that they wear out in just a week or so
i have been taking magnesium for several years to help ward off leg cramps  this formula is the best i have found
elevated toilets are very expensive and hard to find this innovative product solved my problem and you cannot even notice its there my handyman installed it in 30 minutes and i am much the better for it as the old hips aint what they used to be
a friend recommended this product for bruises it works i sprayed the bruised area and rubbed it in then sprayed a bandage and placed it on my arm overnight i did that 3 nights in a row and the bruising was gone my bruises usually take over 2 weeks to finally fade away this stuff really does the trick im thrilled cuz i hate those old lady bruises they look awful now when i bang my arm or hand ill just use this stuff highly recommend 
this will definitely cover both upper and bottom denturel but the container is not leak proof its to be used at home and not for storing dentures while traveling unless stationary
no vitamins what so ever  must of read somewhere that it was the best bang for your buck though
we had rust stains on our countertop from our metal paper towel holder they are gone it took 5 minutes for the pink stuff to do its job wow never thought the stains would go away and they disappeared easily thank you for this amazing product i wish id taken a before pic
not worth anything kinda keeps it cleaner but barely plus makes it even harsher after a few bowls
but did not fit my eyelash curler i didnt realize they werent all the same size
work perfectly in my sally hansen curler the feel isnt as nice as the original that came with the curler but i received a whole bunch of them for less than the curler which is how it should be the ones i received were very colorful pink blue greenno black but i dont really care as long as they fit
very good for muscle relief of neck back arms and legs
all of these socalled healing tools with heating elements seem to emit extremely high emfs im a supersensitive and this thing set me off asap there is an awful odor that smells like burning wires that i could detect after a minute or so of heating the pad was getting hot but i was feeling nauseated being near it so i pulled out the emf meter both settings one for electric and the other for magnetic both fields were almost maxed out at various places on the pad i feel scrambled just having done this experiment and had it on for less than 3 minutes do not recommend that this would assist human health i think the negatives outweigh the benefits as far as ive seen only medicrystal has a method to contain the dirty emfs and have a truly healing heating pad with crystals and this looks like a direct ripoff of their designs
as expected they perform well i have no complaints they do say to sterilize before use i got my normal span of use with them before needing a change will repurchase
i love this long wearing lip color this shade is a somewhat lightmedium pinkmauve shade but is not too light for my fair skin i have difficulty finding cooltoned lipstick that is not too bright  finding pinks  mauves that do not look rosy or peach on me this is perfect with my fair pink skin with blue undertones if i want a slightly darker shade i mix it with another color
these are almost perfect  ive recently painted several rooms cabinets  shelving  i dont like having to go to the garage and haul in a big heavy gallon of paint for a minor touch up  i filled the tubes using the pumps which was easy  quick  i used them once wiped off the felt applicator  stored them in the hall closet  i got them out again last week for more touch ups and 2 of the felt applicator tips came off  i wasnt surprised as i read some previous reviewers had the same problem  this really isnt a huge concern for me as from now on i will just keep a few of the cheap foam brushes next to the tubes  i consider it a very minor inconvenience  well worth it to not have to go back to my old way of doing touch ups  i will be buying another set
while this is a good chair for watching tv it is not very comfortable for longer use  it is easy to assemble but not a good purchase for the price
nice looking and very good quality
over the past eight months ive tried a few different neck traction pillows ive found they are all quite similar and accomplish the same goal with only slight variations in design this one like most others is made of a hard foam with just the slightest bit of give when you rest your head on it its possible to use the pillow in either direction one way providing a more gentle stretch the other a more intense stretch this pillow does not have the bumps and nodes that some others have which are supposed to provide some acupressure and massage to your neck though i cant say that they make much of a difference for me this pillow does however have a softer cushion in the center that makes it a little more comfortable on the back of my head its a very nice featureif youre new to this type of device go slow when i first used one of these pillows i could only lie on it for a few minutes at a time but have worked my way up to 1015 minutes twice a day i also recommend starting with the side that gives you the more gentle stretch for me using a device like this has provided quite a lot of relief to my neck and shoulders that tend to carry a lot of tension since i sit at a computer all dayif youre looking for an alternative to medication for some relief for back and neck pain this is definitely worth a try
let me start off by saying im from philly home of the superbowl champs the eagles   dallas is not very welcome around here however i do like to jab my husband every now and then  i will be using these for tailgating  we have season tickets so i will be taking these to a few games just to freak people out  i used one to hold some cut up watermelon and take it to work for a few coworkers  it zipped and unzipped fine  it didnt leak and didnt stretch  when i unpacked it at lunch there wasnt even a drip that came out of it  for me thats important  i take fruit to work every day and also pack fruit for my whole family i use smaller bags for them but i was treating some coworkers so i needed a large bag like this  i used a bag to store some soft pretzels and put them in the freezer  you really cant go wrong with ziploc  the only thing different is the logo on the bag  its really a beautiful star dallas cowboys star if you are a dallas fan or know one this would be a great gift for them  what i like about ziploc bags is the zipper  i have had others that the zipper gets stuck and i land up breaking it and the bag is useless  i used 4 of these bags and the zipper was easy open and easy close and strong  i have broken zippers by tugging too hard also  these are great bags  this is my normal brand that i buy and have always bought without the dallas star lol
this is just plain great stuff my hair nails and overall improvement in health can attest to that it tastes great and given enough time to dissolve into whatever you are putting it in is nearly clear it takes longer to dissolve in cold beverages than hot and if you dont mix it thoroughly enough itll get glumpy and stick to the spoon until it dissolves patience its worth it i highly recommend this product and have already made numerous orders we even sprinkle it on the pet food for the cats and the piggy
these work great for both reading and watching tv while lying flat they are sturdy and comfortable and make a great gift that is actually useful
bought to clean the bottoms of my pool works great
great nail dryer
this diaper is very soft and well made the velcro holds up thru washing and stays in place its 100 cotton and perfect for a short diaper free time to relieve a red bottom however it leaked through after baby peed once so its for extremely short use i hope they make more absorbent ones because it is really soft and easy to put on and take off
i grew up using hot water bottles when i had stomach aches or back aches its been harder to find hot water bottles though this bottle is the same as id used for years it is easy to fill up and comes with an additional cover to prevent people from touching the bottle when it is too hot  while many people dont use these hot water bottles once youve used it when youre feeling poorly youll see how helpful and comforting they are  i rely on them when im feeling poorly and waiting for medicine or my cure to kick in
helps with a bed ridden person and you can warm them in the microwave  they are also thick and cushioned
beautiful and fun balloons but this should not be called a kit its balloons no strings and no sticks i had to go out at the last minute to purchase the string
this does work fairly well and after a bit of fiddling my problem not the curlers i got it working well its still an extra step i dont always do just because of the extra time  getting set up using it and putting it away  but when i want to go all out this does a great job its easy to use and does work
wife and daughter use and are pleased what else can you ask for
in the bathtub this product works great it is much easier to use than the typical baby baths and can easily be used for an infant in the reclining position or an older baby in the supported sitting position  i love the fact that this takes up less room and makes it much easier to wash the baby directly in the bathtub the bottom seat part has rubber grips to prevent any sliding and the pillow portion floats nicelymy issue with this product is the fact that it holds a ton of water actually absorbs the water and then takes over 24 hours to dry i dont know why it wasnt made to be waterproof considering its used in a bathtub  that said it is still a great alternative to the traditional baby bath it takes up less space and allows the baby more freedom to move around during bath time
these are nice but i feel they are over priced
while i love the convenience it is a lot cheaper to make this yourself the lime seems the most popular and it happens to be the easiest to make you can buy redmonds real salt use the fine ground popcorn variety as your sodium add some calm for magnesium and you can get potassium powder quite cheap you can get true lime powder for the lime flavoring and use a packet of steviaerythritol for the sweetener  voila if you want the raspberry just get some freeze dried raspberries and crush them into a powder and add a little
perfect  i bought this for my daughters dorm room  she loves it
i have a 2 and 4 year old im a nurse and i love microbiology so i have studied which bacterias are commonly in the body and which we need this probiotic is very complete and my kids are always very excited to eat one every night theyre chewable and have a good taste i tried one myself beforehand i have had issues with others i have trued because they refuse to take them so its a huge pluseveryone should take daily probiotics so overall i am very impressed and will keep purchasing them definitely recommend
easy to use
none of them were bent and its still hanging ill be able to reuse
great product my family and i noticed less gas and bloating in just a couple of days after taking prebiotic
i am surprised that this is still available  not a surprise that is comes from england  sometimes i want to clear my passages without the use of drying medications  this temporarily clears nasal passages
it was difficult to know if i was getting the right filter when ordering the one i ordered did not match the one i took out of my filter housing but the new one is 10 stage and it did fit i hate changing the filter the company really needs to come up with a better design for ease of changing the filter
great product  price and fast delivery
the wife made me do it
although normally associated with mens health issues especially those prostate related pumpkin seed oil is a great supplement for both sexes in addition to supporting the bladder and urinary tract it is heart protective it has powerful antiinflammatory properties and is frequently used as an antiparasitic it helps with insomnia and depressionthese capsules by natures bounty are fairly large but i had no difficulty swallowing them and experienced no unpleasant side effects they are somewhat diuretic but i find that they do help me get a good nights sleep my mother has sever arthritis and reported these eased her pain and stiffness i take these as a preventative and am satisfied with this product
these are great glasses to stash around the house because almost everyone can wear them and 150 can help almost everyone but are not too strong its fun to have three different color frames in colorcoordinated snug fitting protective cases the frames are lightweight and comfortable i dont expect them to survive being sat upon for instance the plastic feels like it would snap but they seem like they are durable i find that they are best for reading a book or a computer where you are not moving your head very much because the focal point is fairly specific once you turn your head a little bit the focal point changes more expensive glasses dont seem to do this all in all they are great for an emergency or  for instance  in the bathroom in case you need to read some fine print on a medication bottle etc
my wife love it well built and less cost great for travel and daily use
very nice product works great made very sturdygreat price would recommend this product to any one looking for a foot spa
this horsetail extract is potent i didnt realize thats it would give me energy and it help relieve some joint and muscle pain within the hour when i take it i mix 18 tsp of it in the morning and another 18 tsp at night be careful with this stuff its potent on my first dose of this i tested with 14 tsp and i was bouncing off the wallsi mix this with the following powders nettle root extract curcumin extract ginger root extract boswellia quercitin extract acerola cherry ashwagandha extract and reishi extract which act like a natural antiinflammatory and pain tonicim also taking this horsetail to help build strong bones due to the high silica content horsetail is a great supplement for strong bones and teeth since silica is what gets converted to calcium in the body so this way i allow my body to produce natural calcium it needs to build bonei will be buying more when i run out and look forward to the long term benefits of horsetail
i love these  after wearing dollar store readers for the last 4 years i decided i really needed something i didnt have to take on and take off at church and at class  these are perfect  clear vision in both the plain glass and in the readers i ordered in 200style and classyor so my grandchildren tell me
these earring hooks are super comfy they look fantastic and sophisticated unlike some of the other products it comes with all the essential wire colors highly recommend
handy to have the week ready to go or just grab out the day  the outer case provides additional assurance the meds stay in place while packed
price gouge much
for the price these will work
nice product to have to accommodate bedside commode
these are so convenient and work great
seems to be a good ip6
i have already after 4 days use noticed an improvement in the pain in my thigh
i started taking this supplement about 2 weeks ago  i have rheumatoid arthritis as well as osteoarthritis in both knees  recently i have developed tendonitis in both shoulders so i thought id try thisit gave me the absolute worst heartburn ever  i try to stay away from heartburn medications but pepcid is my 34go to34 for occasional hb relief but even this would not relieve iti will not buy again nor would i recommend it to anyone
duplicate needed in two rooms kids fight over stars no more  thank you for posting sale
one of the two pill organizers is small and the other is large i ordered two of the large ones but received two different sizes annoying last time i ordered two and got two of the same sizeotherwise these gsk pill dispensers are nice  better than the cheap cvs version although the cvs dispensers take less turns to open these gsk organizers are better for traveling more sturdy
this came and i ordered it off experiencing it from a friends place it isnt as high as the old seat cushion i used but its definitely better quality and comfortable cushion it only has this one issue of a really weird smell it smelled like it when it came thought it would go away and is simply a new product smell but has yet to go away overall though good product do wish it had a thicker variation maybe it does and i missed it however
this brush is twosided the only thing i like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back however i would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puffthe other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and i have to stretch to reach my entire back in addition the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me there is already a hole in the handle for hanginga selfadhesive hook is provided for hanging although i did not use thatin summary this is functional but is the least favorite back washer i tried so far also the current price of 1499 is outrageous for this
i really liked how this is a lot more comfortable than most rope most rope is really rough on your skin but this is really soft it would be much tougher to get rope burn than with most ropes but it holds really well too its also easy to tie knots withthis is about 32 feet of rope and so if youre going for some serious partner tying then you probably need about three skeins to completely tie someone upthe ends are taped and so theyll eventually fray if you plan on reusing this rope a lot then youll want to burn the ends so they dont fray its not ultrathick but this also means that it goes a lot farther than thicker ropethis comes in a few different colors and i like red the bestprosvery soft and comfortableperfect for adult restraint funholds fast without injuryattractive rope and colorsconsonly 32 feet 10 metersoomph gave me this rope to review
this is not three ply its two its usable in an emergency the texture is rough but really just a novelty gift that will gather dust until its regifted or thrown away the printing isnt centered per sheet so it loses some of it fun if it cant be read or the emoji is half missing still as a gag gift its good for a laugh not much else
best facial tissue manufactured ever in the course of human history yes i have tried them all even those ones that leave wooden splinters embedded in ones eye and nose ouch that was the moment when i decided to buy puffs plus with lotion exclusively i have accidentally washed  dry them  they never fall apart and ruin the wash load as others do fabulous tissue quality will never use any other tissue i love this tissue so much i subscribe it was exceedingly well packaged and arrived on time
super great taste and results are amazing
i had this bench in my cart for months i wasnt sure if i wanted to spend the money if it was not good quality finally i ordered it so i could have a place to sit and shave my legs in the shower it is heavy and of very good quality easy and fast to assemble it is high enough where i dont have to squat to sit its perfect
the next day upon  using the grabber it pinched my hand and i received a small cut from that all told the price is what attracted me so it didnt sway me i feel i got what i paid for no more no less
after seeing some reviews i can honestly say that this product is probably not for overweight people  im a 52 130lb woman and i loooovvvvveeee this cushion my butt and legs were going numb in my office chair so i bought this it feels squishy and soft yet supportive sitting on this makes me so happy its bouncy and fun and comes in a black zip cover
this is so easy to use it took me all of 2 seconds if that to check my temperature after reading the instructions there is a quick start instruction sheet and then the full instruction and care booklet you can check the ambient temperature of the room as well as check your temperature via the forehead or the ear canal i checked both and the reads were really close to the same temperature and both so easy to accomplish being digital is a big plus as wellit comes in a velvet bag for storage and cleaning instructions are very easy with no chemicals or alcohol necessary just a wet cloth i always have to use alcohol to wipe down my mouth thermometer so that no germs are transferred but this one doesnt touch saliva so the concern of sharing sickness is minimali highly recommend this product
great for icing my knee after acl reconstruction lighter than the chatanooga
love this product
it dissolves do nicely compared to other kava kava powders i find that at a dose of 12 tsp it is very mild again milder than some other kava powders ive used and creates a nice calm feeling good product good company
bought this for my neighbor and she loves it
these are pretty large pill boxes i can carry a weeks worth of pills in one of the boxes the plastic is pretty good quality latch is not fancy but feels secure enough
very efficient
i have this thermometer for 13 months and thanks god my kids are super healthy and they barely got sick my daughter got sick yesterday and had a very high fever and this thermometer was like a joke it gave me consecutive readings like 1045  1037  1019 1012 i tested both ear and forehead and no luck i knew she had a very high fever but i wanted to know exactly how much but with this thermometer that was not possiblei tried to call the customer service because they usually want to make the customer happybut not this timethey told me that as the warranty expired one month ago and they could not do anything i get thatbut i just thought a 24 thermometer will last more than one year so i guess i need to buy another thermometer but im not buying innovo ever again
this product is great to put on every so often to try and prevent diaper rash i like this product too as the smaller size is perfect for the diaper bag i recommend only have 2 pictured but it came with 3 and dont get confused it is a smaller tube but as i mentioned perfect for travel
little to no taste  i just added the powder to smoothies and it was fine  didnt really alter the taste of the smoothie at all  the bag is a decent quality but i find these fine powders sometimes get stuck in the zip lock so dumping them in a jar has been my preferred storage way
looking forward to using this product in a couple of weeks
trying to find a way to incorporate apple cider vinegar into our diets what could be easier than gummies they taste good and theyre effective
there is no research to suggest that cordyceps mycelium is medicinal all the research is on the fruiting body or what most people actually think of as the mushroom
i am surprised at how heavy and well made they are  they really do what they state  it is very easy now to lay in bed and watch tv without causing pain in my neck  i didnt really like reading with them because i need reading glasses so trying to wear two pair of glasses at the same time is just not comfortable for me  my husband liked them so much that even though he doesnt have a neck injury he wants a pair just because he said it was so comfortable watching tv laying flat on your back
i used them for led light therapy i wish they blocked more light out they stick to your eyes so be careful i pushed them down to block out more light and getting them to unstick to my eyelids wasnt fun probably better for tanning
so easy to dust furniture without long edges of a rag trailing behind i love that my hand can grip curved edges and get each and every single bit of dust
i have 105 straws they are a great size for larger cups but they are a little tall for my normal starbucks drink i bought this shorter size so i didnt have quite so much straw sticking up over my cup this has been great and i dont feel like i might impale myself on my latte straw anymore ive also used in a standard 12 oz can of soda and have been happywhat makes this set really stand out compared to others i have purchased is that it comes with the carry bag and the straw brushes thats super helpful especially if this is a first straw purchase
the hotcold therapy pack is great i mainly use it as an ice pack  just strap it on and sit back and relax
im allergic to pretty much everything so these softener dryer sheets are a lifesaver they do not irritate my skin at all
the material of this toothbrush feels cheap and light but the performance was good i think this toothbrush is more to use outside the house like in an office or traveling its portable by that i mean its a smaller size than my regular toothbrush the power was good and cleaned my teeth well
might as well put this on subscription use this all the time for camping and beach i dont smell horrible and it makes my skin feel great
saved me from getting seasick
i use ziploc bags frequently because they make highquality products  having the seahawks logo on the bag makes it that much more special in this washingtonbased home clear bags are a must for attending games plus when youre making special gifts for fellow seahawks fans this bag makes for a perfect presentation  go seahawks
this product looks cool and i thought i would like it however its a bit difficult to open and there have been several times where ive opened it and the meds have spilled out
thank you
works well in foods and as a supplement  i have used this product before and a little goes a long ways
ive had it for about a week and so far so good i think you never know with cats though you know what i mean i love kittens but i cant stand adult cats so finding out that some random cat has been messing with my outdoor plants certainly doesnt help their cause i thought about buying a zapper mat or motion detector spray but neither is workable for outside and although i personally hate cats im the only one in my family that feels this way so i thought this would be more humane it smells like big red gum to me  im very happy that it doesnt smell like a bunch of disgusting chemicals  and because it can be used outside and is safe for plants and is supposed to stick around even if it rains it seemed perfect also i hate the thought of me having to invest any money into cat related crap so this seemed like the most economical choice too i sprayed it every night the first 3 nights including one night when it rained and then i forgot to spray it the next day so its been every other day since so far my plants have remained untouched but i have no idea if its because of the spray or because the stupid cat just hasnt been around to harass my plants yet if my plants remain untouched after a month i think ill be convinced and begrudgingly buy this spray again when i run out
these look better for men instead of women
these arent 100 effective but theyre more convenient long lasting  durable than anything you can make they dont last forever though eventually the filter will get pretty stinky and youll want to replace it but for this price  how long you can use it its still worth the investment
ive had insomnia for 2 decades  its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel even when im in a room far from elevators snack machines etclast week we went to atlantic city for a few days  i was lucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snackice machines but i knew that wouldnt be enough  i took a silk sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the beston the first night i was exhausted from driving and walking around all daynight yet i couldnt sleep then i remembered i had packed the mask and ear plugs so i climbed out of bed and got them from my bag  boy did the mask make it nice and dark  the earplugs blessedly gave me total silence as well i did not fall asleep immediately but sleep did come and that rarely happens for me on vacation  i usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake what a nice surprise to actually be able to get a few hours of sleepthe mask darkened the room tremendously even the next morning when i woke up to a sunny bright and cloudless day the room was still dark for me thanks to the mask  the mask was nice and soft and the mask itself was comfortable the band that went around my head was very tight and took a bit for me to get used to  the earplugs did a glorious job of drowning out my husbands horrific snoring  on the second night i was able to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed asleep through the night thanks to the mask that kept the light out of the room and the earplugs which by the way are very comfortable and flexible and soft  that kept the horrific snoring sounds as well as the maids cart noises from the hallway silentso glad i had the mask and earplugs with me i was actually able to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them
this is comforting wasnt into the music it was nice that this came charged right out of the box so you could use it right away unfortunately it has an older usb port
works well on most surfaces 
i have tried a few different facial scrubs and was very disappointed in this one  i have another tube of scrub similar to this one that i refuse to use  i will be purchasing my favorite real scrub when my current tube is nearly out  it is about half gone now so it shouldnt be too long  what i like about my facial scrub is that it has plenty of scrubbies in the paste that i put on my face  that way i can get all the dry flaky skin off my face clearing the way for new clean skin to be washed with a gentle soap and then moisturized with a light facial oil  i have dry skin as i am older  i dont have dual skin with oily and dry patches  i have dry skin period  the scrubbing granules in my favorite facial scrub ensures that all the old skin is gone  this product is so wimpy  it has barely anything scrubby in the paste meaning i would need to use about half the tube just to get enough scrubbies on my face to get rid of the dead dry skin on my face especially on my forehead and around my nose  just not worth it for my particular skin
i have no idea what bilberry does so let me say that first  we take these for general eye health and vision issues such as night blindness affected us ppl who are older   the lutein and the zeaxanthin were both recommended by our eye dr  there are 60 in this bottle so it gives a one month supply to us  both are made from marigold extracts
good product  do the work
first let me start off by saying i did not have this for more than a night i returned it quite quickly it smelled quite toxic which possibly could of faded with time but i was not interested in waiting for that on top of this i just wasnt comfortable for me to sit on its quite firm and it raises you a bit more extensively off of whatever youre sitting on than i thought just not for me plus its rather expensive
great product relieves upset stomach as well as heartburn
i used these inserts to reduce the volume on a shoe that had a bit too much room in the toebox  i followed the included directions cutting the insert to size and then used a hair dryer to heat mold them inside the shoes be careful if doing this on shoes with plastic parts the ones i was using them in were leather so molding them in place wasnt a concern  after molding they fit and feel great recommended
very good and clear sounding speaker it definitely works better than i thought it would it has several different sounds that was not expected great purchase
the addition of this pad took our 15 year old massage table to the next level while i would have liked for the pad to be a little thicker it is a great value and we are very happy with iti think it would easily fit a larger table and it is advertised to fit up to a 34 x 76 tablewe have only used the cool side so far
good product  just need to be careful to line the battery with the charger 34prongs34  or will not charge correctly  exactly what we needed for our phone
i had been using emjoi battery operated micro unit for years had tried others but they dont come anywhere this companys products when i saw this was available i couldnt wait to order quick efficient and does just as prescribed one of my favorite purchases
i wasnt to happy with this purchase as its just too hard and not comfortable  if you are not using it as a neck roll then perhaps it would work for you but if you are it wouldnt be the right purchase
these last about 1 hour of continual comfortable hear  about 1 inch across  all these types seem pricy for a chinese product
we bought this to keep the horde of feral cats in our neighborhood from using our front yard as a litter box we followed the directions and even extended the daily application by 4 days but  it did very little to deter them from using our mulched area as a bathroom if keeping wild cats out of your yard is your intended purpose for this spary my experience is that it doesnt do the trick
reasonably priced and a great natural supplement to help ward off bad things  super fast shipping too
this fish oil comes in well packaged and sealed as well as clear in its 50day quantity as well as expiration date and various other contents the fish oil capsule slowly melts in the mouth and it tastes delicious
love it came on time works great and no complaints fantastic
these are exactly as described and what i expected herb combo size heat delivery so if the description suits what you think your after then dont hesitate arrived quickly and well packaged i appreciate the inclusion of paper shields for ifwhen desired or needed i thought it was a decent price too  if you are not experienced with this sort of thing you should do some web searching for videos on moxibustion treatment or have your acupuncturist show you theres a lot of good info available these light very easily  just as expected
puffs are very low quality thin and not nearly as soft as other lotion tissue the price was not much different so i feel the value is low buy kleenex or one of many store brands that are far better quality
bought this for a friend and it works great also try looking for a shirt with drain holder pockets the mesh holder is good but my friend uses a ziplock bag for the shower and then puts them in the mesh bag maybe try to find something water resistant to avoid getting too much water on them
love these  finally a place for larger pills
i got this as a gift for my nephew who is struggling with depression and medical problems the black tourmaline is perfect to cleanse his space of negative energy and will promote healing he loved it and really enjoyed spreading out the branches and leaves to his liking this is a great gift and the black tourmaline is beautiful
i have fibromyalgia and use this to loosen up my shoulders and relief the pain  it works very well  you need a small amount so the tube last longer than you think it would  the smell is very strong when you put it on my cat runs from the room but gets very light quickly  just make sure to wash your hands immediately after use
i wasnt impressed with this set  the minute i removed this stainless steel roller from the box the roller part fell off the rod this is a stainless steel roller not a natural jade stone so its heavier and the handle appeared unable to support the topheavy roller the gua sha silver stone was alright but the roller was obviously not made well if the head broke off upon first use i used a pair of pliers to fix it but am not impressed i think ill stick with the natural jade stone or rose quartz ones
perfect i have been using it for the last 6 months and works as advertised
got for my daughter it helps her so great buy
no dislike at all love the toothpaste
i have issues with my feet a chiropractor showed me how to relieve the pain by using a golf ball and rolling it around with the area of my foot that happens these inserts help prevent that from happening and i can do without the golf ball
i sprayed a biking backpack that i wear when i ride my bike  i often carry food and a lot of stuff in it and it always gets grimy  i washed it once in the machine and it did ok but i decided to spray it all over with this spray  it went on fine  the family said it had a smell but i could barely detect it  i had enough to lay on two coats with some left over  i havent used my backpack yet but i needed to get a review up in time so i will update it if i think it doesnt work as advertised
these are stabby
this has helped our 4yearold son who is displaying some signs of autism tremendously  since beginning the fish oil he is sleeping better having more regular bowel movements and fewer accidents in his underwear talking more playing with toys more appropriately and answering questions without simply repeating the question back to us  the flavor is wonderful and does not taste fishy at all  i mix it for the kids in yogurt and they gobble it down  this fish oil has truly made a remarkable difference for us and we will be customers for life
the gooad dog clippers work well and are surprisingly quiet this is great when trimming as my dog is skittish the rechargeable batteries and extra attachments make this a great value
while it didnt miraculously make my teeth as white as snow it did make them a bit lighter the instructions it comes with leave much to be desired they are very vague it comes with whitening strips packets the light machine and silicone teeth mold first thing to do you have to open the battery holder there is a paper disk between two flat batteries to prevent them from running out since the button on the top is so sensitive small accidental touch will turn it onthe strips come in two sizes  short and long i tried both sizes on both sets of teeth and determined that longer goes on the top teeth and the short one goes on the lower teeth it would have been nice to have it confirmed in the instructions the whitening cycle times vary from 3045 minutes with the requirement not to eat or drink one hour afterwards the whitening light machine shuts off every 10 minutes on the dot as if to remind not to leave it in too long first time my teeth felt tingly and slightly cool but then nothing out of ordinary happened since it has to stay put in there for a while the saliva that collects behind the teeth has to go somewhere i swallowed it it was not overly unpleasant with slight traces of something its ok whitening kit but it does not perform miracle
i wanted something a little bit different these are just right
anything with gerry in it gets 5 stars automatically d it arrived quickly and in good condition which is always a concern with printed materials
i have read that glyconutrient therapy helps punch up the immune system to ward off viruses i am all for this and was also looking for a supplement that will help level out our blood sugars since taking this product i cant say that it is a miracle drug of some kind but can say that my blood sugars have remained normal when before they would periodically read high and i have not come down with a cold or flu knock on wood so is it working  id have to say so its kind of like 34elephant repellant34 if you spray some around and never see an elephant is it working 
using this on my 6 month old baby for nebulizer works great
product seems well made i have the one with extra padding the bad part is the strength of the massage  its simply too low its weaker than the handheld massage devices in my opinion i cannot see how anyone with a serious ailment gets any relief from this even at highest settings i did not feel it to be effective and heat was not working at all or felt like itdoes not look like it will be comfortable or recommend to put it on a sitting position this also occupies considerable amount of space so if you have people sitting at same location you will need to move it each time
these are super cheap plastic the head doesnt even move just the handle not worth it
returned for a shorter half roll this was not the right roller
one of the better variety of balance bars varieties super yummy candy bar like i almost wish i had never even found or tried these because they are almost too good
great product  it works great  easy to use must buy
i was amazed at its performance but i decided not to buy it instead something else no biggy
fits better than the knockoffs but pricey since model is discontinued
so the pump did not come with the package  personally i dont care because i have other ways to inflate the bowl  but because people that may not have that ability this really pisses me off  very unfortunate because the device does work if you can inflate it  fyi my husband is disabled and bedridden  i am 15 years younger than him so i worked thru this issue  but if you dont have that ability dont buy this item
i put one in my tiny office and another in my living room to help with cigarette smoke and animal odors  i have not noticed one bit of difference in the smell of my home since i put them in  i gave them two months and now of course cannot return them  there is absolutely no change in either room and both rooms have no change in the air quality
based on the good reviews i was hoping this would be better i have a herniated disc between l5 and s1 this product is very large and very hard it hurt my back so i will be donating it to a friends father who is in a wheelchair
will see if the duration was worth the investment product works  just need to determine cost
these socks are great the fabric is soft smooth lovely feels really nice next to my skin i love how colorful  fun these compression socks are because all ive found up until now were just drab tan black or white stockings that looked hideous just because i have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities feet calves doesnt mean i want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose these are so cute bright  colorful the only downside is that i am wearing these due to leg swelling  when my calves are real swollen which is often unfortunately the design on some of these socks gets stretched out causing you to lose the very thing that makes these so pretty the design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost on some designs  not so colorful this hasnt happened on all the socks ive purchased from this maker i have about 6 pairs but definitely on some if youre on the thin side or dont experience much swelling this probably wont be a problem at all a solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes like small  large
works greattip dont advance the dosage too fast or it can make you sicker as it activates dormant detox pathways and dont give up on it if you feel worse just cut back until you find the easy safe dose then let your cravings for it control your intake from there your mind will think about it and taste crave it when its time use this with remyte it works well together their other product dont make much sense to me ymmvit tastes exactly like magnesium chloride so i dont believe the sellers claim that chloride is removed
arrives in an extraordinary wellengineered conformal package the pictured box arrives within a box kudos to the productdesigners who chose this outstanding packaging methodthe oil quality is the lightest i can recall and absolutely tasteless the glass bottle and stopper are countertop accent qualitymuch better than expected topqualitywas my review helpful if so click helpful so i can know
absolutely fantastic  i use it daily when i shower  great relief for dry itchy skin
excellent product mixes beautifully well with water making it easy for onthego portability i have also blended it with fresh strawberries as well as fresh blackberries for a twist on lemonade this will be a regular item tastes great especially when it is hot outside would highly recommend it
this could be a useful mini razor for traveling i say could since i cant say how well it shaves  i was never able to get it to turn on i initially thought it was shipped with a discharged battery which is sometimes the case with rechargeable products however after letting it charge for a few hours it still would not turn on the shaver got rather warm while charging and the charge indicator light turned on but those were the only indications of lifethe design is something ive not come across before its a rotary shaver but the heads are arranged in a straight line the heads are smaller than is customary on a rotary the construction is all plastic and feels rather cheap still it has some nice grip points and feels pretty good in hand as a travel shaver the lightweight nature and the smaller size could be plussessince it failed to turn on at all the only rating i can give is 1 star a shame since i would have liked to see the shaving performance of the lineararranged rotary heads
mounting bracket would not tighten because the material is too weak  i bent the bracket to fit tighter but it just bent back when tightening  i finally screwed the bracket to the column by drilling and tappinghooks for the basket were too tight to install it  had to be reshaped to be functional
ordered wrong one but still can use it
this is the best product in the market i swear by it just like the people on the my big fat greek wedding i always say 34did you put some glycerin on it34 my pimple put some at night  over night it reduces the swelling and makes it ready to 34pop34 in the morning i dont even dilute it with anything
i like it despite some reviews i have decided to buy and it worked great i used in couple of projects once as an additive to epoxy glue and it is brighter and longer than a lot of medium and higher class watch hands
doesnt do for my big size catbrush is very not flexible hardmy cat doesnt like it at all
this is my third purchase of better sleep earplugs i love them hubby had had his nose broken seven times football so he doesnt just snore his nose speaks alien languages im not the best at caring for them i just pull them out and put them on the head of the bed then sometimes the cats bat  them around or the grandkids in residence mix them with playdohbut thats okay because these earplugs are washableafter 812 months i replace themtheyre a bargain because they really work
i dont tolerate all peppermint well  i have both acid reflux and a hiatal hernia so somethings help some make it worsei tried these and they have a soft taste you get the peppermint but it doesnt irritate going downrecommended for those who want a smoooooth peppermint to just ease a tummy issue like upset nauseawill keep these as a staple in my medicine chest and kitchen cupboard  oh and i like the tin 
overall its not bad i have had better tasting types of hydration packets or powders see nuun i think that while the salt count is fairly low compared to other brands the saltiness stands out more with this brand overall it does what it needs to do and i feel equally as good after my runs as i do with other brands i think based on price alone i would purchase again since this brand appears to be slightly cheaper than other brands for the quantity offered overall i would give a 75 out of 10
i try to wash my face very infrequently when possible because overwashing just gets it to produce more oils  but when i need to remove makeup or i will wash my face anyway shower i really like this wash  it seems completely natural gentle and i dont feel it chipping away at my microbiomeseems to be a health and ecoconscious product
my husband likes his and highly recommends this item
the only sturdy travel transparent case out there
 update  after 6 months of on and off usage i would guess about 125 wearings the main band hookandloop velcro is one brand of hookandloop type closure is shot  the 2 straps start separating as soon as they are attached one good cough or bending over and scritchit pops open  i am most certainly not a big person so i am not stressing the connection in that respect all hookand loop does wear out the hooks start to get straightened out with repeated pulls of the loop side and subsequently they stop grabbing and holding the loop  the highest quality products have thick stout hooks that last a very long time  i feel that should you plan on wearing this item everyday you may be buying 2 or 3 a year  aside from this issue rendering the brace unwearable i still feel this is a fantastic braceoriginal postthis is not the first posture corrector i  have purchased through amazon but it will be the last  this is a very well engineered and constructed product and i commend the sellermanufacturer on delivering a corrector that actually worksi had been going through progressive slouching shoulder slump and fhp forward head positionto the layman like me that just means not looking straight ahead but down to differing degrees  i had been told that i was looking down all the time  in actively assessing myself i found that to be true  this observation of slumping over and head position led me to understand why i was going through progressive upper back shoulder and neck pain  every morning and evening i was on an acetaminophen and ibuprofen regimenmy previous posture corrector experience was awful  poorly engineered uncomfortable and one size fits all seems to be the normin receiving this product box i was a bit apprehensive  i didnt want further disappointment  i gave this purchase a 4 star review for two reasons  i really want to give a 5 star review because the product actually works as advertised but there are a couple of issues if i could give a 45 star review i would for better or worse positive change occurs on amazon through the process of accurate and honest reviewsmy first reason for not rating my experience as a 5 may seem petty to some but i feel it has importance  on opening the box and removing the brace there was not a single stitch of product literature included  in my humble opinion basic information regarding the product itself guarantee explanation with returnrefund information and some basic seller contact information should have been included  there were none of the pages that can be seen on the amazon website that are just great  copies of the photos and fitting instructions should also have been with the product i was going back and forth between my computer and my bathroom mirror to assure proper fitment when i first put this on it did not feel right and i found that i was wearing it too low by looking at the photo of the model  for future reference when not logged on to the computer having package inserts would be fantasticnow to the corrector once i was properly fitted it was immediately obvious that this device was going to prove beneficial  when i first strapped it on it seemed that i would only receive moderate correction  i realized that i was not holding my shoulders neck and head up straight and in proper alignment before stretching and attaching the shoulder straps to the belly band  upon doing this correctly a significant amount of support was felt  by pulling pretty tight on the straps while in proper posture before attachment of the bands my alignment is now perfect my posture without the corrector was poorbut not as bad as i have seen with other people in order to retain proper alignment with the corrector i had to give the straps a pretty good stretch  i am 51134 tall and 190 pounds  it is only reasonable that the device straps will have to be pulled tighter for a bulkier person there is just going to be more physical resistance to correction if you are smaller than me such tension may not be requiredthis is where my second issue is keeping me from a 5 star review comes up  for those of use requiring extra tension on the straps to maintain proper spinal alignment the straps can 34cut34 into the armpits to an uncomfortable degree  some sort of well designed underarm cushioning would be greatly appreciatedlastly i can only wear this brace for about 2 hours before my back muscles start aching  i do not consider this to be a negative in any wayactually it is quite the opposite  this lets me know the brace is working as advertised  those muscles in my back have been stretching and stretching over the years and are at the heart of my poor posture  they are not enjoying being 34recompressed34  tough  over time muscle fibers begin to grow together  this corrector i feel will facilitate just that take tension off the brace as soon as you begin to feel any of the aching i have described above  continued use after that point will cause discomfort for some time after the brace is removed  for some people i imagine this period of initial correction may be as short as 45 minutes to an hour perhaps even less for the elderlyi am going to get one for my 70 year old mother if she gives in to trying it it takes time to gain new muscle memory  the longer you use the device every day the length of time you will be able to wear it comfortably will most likely extend in using this corrector these aching muscles will begin to calm down over time  the support is not just holding things in place it is forcing the body to improve itself  i fully believe that actual postural healing will take place and down the road i will only need the support as a  reminder rather than a maintaineri wear a tshirt every day and even when tightly tucked in the corrector is virtually invisible underneath it  from when i first put the corrector on in the morning i do not take it off until bedtime  i simply go through comfortable cycles of tensioning the main strap and releasing it when i feel it is neededthe device is lightweight and unobtrusive  only the tightest or sheerest of clothing would give away its presencebravo tigoof  you really have a winner here and i highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing postural issues such as mine slouching forward head position and shoulder slumping and suffering from the chronic neck and shoulder pain that i was  as an aside my working at the computer for any extended period of time would get to feeling fiery in the upper back i dont do computer work now without the brace  and no longer experience that discomfort i highly recommend this support to long duration computer usersthis is a fantastic product you should feel very secure in purchasing  the few negative things i mentioned are more than likely issues specific to me or perhaps to other people my size or larger  i am confident that if you order the correct size and find the justright fit for you this corrector will prove itself to be quite an asset  if you dont feel just that way contact the seller  they are fantastic to work with  i cant wait for my few issues to be dealt with in some fashion for all future purchasers so i can i can come back and give this product a solid 5 star rating i couldnt be more pleased with my purchasegood day  good backstlaffoon
the mask is easy to cleanhas elastic to hold on the childs head but it runs smallit did not fit my nine year oldest face it also has a strong chemical smell
so far so good i watched the cats on our cameras turn away from where i sprayed this product the only problem is you need to spray it about every other day i hope this continues to work or the next stop for the cats is the humane league
great product would buy again
fits better than the original on my arm
kind of bulky it does the job
i was soso with this product  i was thinking it was ok if you wanted to spend the money  then i fell  a stupid fall no need to explain  with 60 as my next birthday i was in some severe pain  i thoughtcopper calf compression sleeveswhy  well i totally wiped out my right calfnot in the back but the front  i fell duh  i am now a convert  there is nothing greater than copper sleeves  i now have elbow and hand gloves  this company rocks it cool
really liked this as did everyone who smelled it wish the bottle would have been a little bigger and the shower gel didnt smell very long
one of the finest whey isolate protein powders available  fantastic for the lactose intolerant  flavors that are some of the best i have ever had  this one is for the chocolate  best chocolate ever
this is a great back brace  the only issue is that i bought it for my 80year old father and it is difficult for him to put it on himself  well constructed and comfortable even when pulled quite tight  definitely helps with posture
also i like that the days can be separated
it clean the way they say
bought this to help with bruising after surgery and i think it worked a bit but i didnt use it more than a week or so and i also used ice so im not sure
put it in and it fits fine around my car seat  i dont think any cartruck seat will have a problem if it is a bucket seat i will test it out and adjust the review if i have any issues  so far it seems supportive  i like the fact that there is no memory foam so no odor  it came shipped in a big box so no issues with the quality of the product upon arrival  if i can figure out where i put my calcium everything would be greatupdateair freshner smell stuck to product and does not smell like lavender  returned
very disappointed would not hold liquid the opening kept popping open woke up two mornings with an empty brush would not recommend went back to an oxo brand brush with a screw on dispenser
this review process with amazon has changed you read reviews to a product that has nothing to do with the product your looking at
easy to breath in  very big  easier to talk in  washes well
pretty sweet and has the artificial taste of an orange starburst not really a flavor i want in a drink someone that doesnt mind artificially sweetened drinks may not find the flavor to be an issuewould highly recommend using cold water to drink this down because it helps cut the sickly sweetnessi took half a scoop midday which comes out to 125mg of caffeine about the strength of a cup of coffeei didnt feel too jittery anxious or crazy just a little more up and focused during my workoutso overall i didnt care too much for the flavor but i enjoy the effects so ill continue to use it and just drink it quickly haha
these lens wipes work really well and were very happy with them good price for so many of them
its really good i am using every day good for health
purchased this to add in a smoothie recipe  this is fantastic flavor and i am sure packed with major nutrients  i would definitely recommend to someone who makes smoothies all of the time  i put a teaspoon in blender with frozen cherries banana orange juice and it was spectacular  will purchase again
solves a common problem almost everyone who has ever used an ace bandage for more than a day or two has lost some if not all the clips and dropping a clip onto a hard floor and accidently stepping on it renders it useless so what do you do when you need to use that ace bandage but have too few or worse yet no clips at all ive tried using safety pins as an alternative when i have no clips but found that is really not a good solution as it does not hold the end of the bandage evenly this pack of 50 clips will last a long time and im glad that its a pack of 50 as they are not really durable so they have to be replaced fairly often like 34 days but they are a much better alternative than to safety pins and certainly buying another expensive ace bandage they also come in handy to use on a really wide ace bandage as the number of clips supplied by ace seems inadequate im glad i bought them
good product  buy them all the time
this item really should not be sold here as it is temperature sensitive and needs to be shipped with an ice pack during the warm months who knows what the temps are in the amazon warehouses i would say to stick with buying this from your local practitioner because after it has been subjected to the heat it probably is no longer good at all or less strength at best waste of money to buy a probiotic that no longer works
these are super soft and nice i give lower rating because when a few hours they were flattened and hard i realize it will in time but expected it would still provide some cushion
to me there is nothing like a full mesh body puff it is the only thing i use in the shower outside of a back brush nevertheless these mitts have the best of two worlds the mesh is thin and sewn onto the glove the glove has two finger holes for the thumb depending on which side is being used if i want a sudsy wash i pull this on like a glove and use the mesh side if i want to exfoliate i turn it over and use the rough side it also has a loop for hangingit does not replace my favorite shower sponge but this comes close also these can be used to wash the dishes if one does not want to use them for the showerthe current price of 1398 comes to an expensive 699 per mitt
i do like this product but it only has one hot temperature and although it has buttons to adjust the temperature of the brush they dont do anything
so far the pills are fine and easy to take and thank you for the quick mailing them
my boyfriend needed a new clipper and cordless seemed the best option  i can help him and hed have a easier time cutting his hair  these clippers are amazin  trust me
i was pleasantly surprised how these pads helped easy pain on the balls of my feet when wearing heels i was skeptical but now im not recommended
very soft easy to put on there are strands of the yarn poking through the front so i dont know how well it will wear over time
bought this for my niece she loves it 
these seemed to work well at first but they loose their effectiveness after a while dont work as well as they are supposed to
this machine is amazing it has many different attachments and gets you where you want to be great price too i was going to order elsewhere and they wanted like 150 and this is way less and comes with way more its strong and is well worth the buy
got this for my son for christmas  he loves it hes a welder in a machine shop and his body pays a price it arrived today and he tested it out at my urging with no real hope for it doing muchhes had other products in the past and nothing really gets into deep tissue and reverberates out and makes a difference for him to have any relief  i did his back for 10 mins with thisand he was smiling not to make his mom feel good but because something finally got his muscles to relax  the 2 heads on this are what i think do the trick for making it all happen  the various speeds and alternate attachments will be an added benefit in the long run  its easy to balance and he managed as well to do it but not as good as when someone else does it lol
i got these they were a great deal but i feel like they stink until you get used to them they are somewhat soft but not like id expect from tissue with lotion
it has the touch and strength of highend plastic cutlery labeled compostable in industrial facilities and that you should check locally as these do not exist in many communities it probably goes without saying that these are not suitable for backyard composting the bonus is that these are made from renewable sources
went to the dentist for a fitted plastic retainer for 150 and use this at night amazing whitening with zero gum or tooth pain crest white strips hurt my gums
useless the spring is bigger and coarser than other brands ive tried and didnt even epilate  i felt nothing pulling or epilating when i used it but did when i  immediately tried  my older wand from another company  i threw these 2 away  thankfully they were not expensive  ive learned bellabe is worth the extra money
when i was growing up my mother was always trying to sneak healthy ingredients into our food without us knowing spirulina powder is a much more subtle way of doing just that mixing it in with acidic sauces or dressings completely mask the flavor i add it to spaghetti and lasagna and no one suspects a thing great way to sneak in some iron and protein
its kind of hard to mess up basic dish gloves these are pretty standard gloves and they perform just as well as any others ive ever used the center of the palm has slightly textured area to improve your trip on wet dishes im allergic to latex and these did not cause any rash hives or redness and itching so they seem to actually be latex free
these eyeglass cases are very handy and cute  they fit in my purse really well  the order came quickly  i was pleased
love but a bit on the heavy side
these masks are super cute and comfortable the stretchy band could be just a hair larger or even adjustable but other then that they are great i love there is a pocket for the gel pack i get migraines often so these are so helpful
great for cake pops
my rocking santa is a whimsical addition to my window sill i enjoy seeing him rocking
the last time i ever smelled smelling salts was when i was a kid and another kid in the neighborhood had a bottle of them for some reason  we all smelled it and i havent forgotten how strong it smelled  these westside barbell smelling salts are just as strong  however this time i used the technique i learned in chemistry class in college which was not to stick my nose right over the flask beaker or whatever container but to hold it out from my face and waft the air over it with my hand towards my snout  these are very good smelling salts
1st day had a headache and jaws were clinched  waited a few days because i wanted focus and memory and tried with 12 of a capsule and stayed on that dose for a week without any headache or clinched jaw side effects  after a week went to 1 full capsule and love the results  i have so much energy drive motivation focus and ability to remember  i really think that at 67 i have lost a lot of my 34mind34  with optimind i am back like i was in my 20s  if you think it is expensive call them and order 6 bottles at a time it gets the cost down to 25 a bottle  my husband who usually just laughs at my supplements tried one he takes one daily now  both of us love what it does for our mind and energy  after 3 weeks on them thought i probably should take a day and rest well i did rest after cleaning out the garage cleaning my car inside and out two hours of  shopping and coming home to fix dinner  before optimind i would open the garage door look at the mess and close the door  it all seemed like too big of a job most supplements are hype not optimind  not sure why it didnt work for the people that rated it anything less than a 5 unless they are some of the few people that still have their 34minds34 intact  ill gladly give up other things to afford optimind  besides with optimind i save money from not paying others to do what i was too tired to do or couldnt focus or think clearly enough to do
arrived on time strength equipment to others of same strength narrow rimless lens perfect for reading  watching tv at same time
i finally found the readers that do not look like readers  i have been looking for this specific design for well over a year the packing is lovely  a glass zippered case with wipe cloth looks exactly like in picture  i love these and will order extra pair
used it for less than two months and it dieddo not buy
bought the 2 pack one for my 94 year old grandma and another for my nephews only used it with my grandma but i know my nephews will get a kick out of it too i used to have them when i was young my grandma and i both enjoyed them keep in mind the measurements theyre pretty small
lovely aroma it smells also like cologne its really strong but i got used to it after one day many happy compliments from anyone that has gotten into my car
these are a great solution for lifes little inconsistencies  very comfortable and discreet i would recommend this product
we been using it since 2016 the germ guardian gg1000 7 pluggable small air purifier  and it works  we use it in the bathroom never had a problem with it
some of them fit and are a really neat concept but all of them are basically cut different sizes and shapes i would rather have something tighter fitting to use a device all of the finger lengths are random a stretchy fabric would be helpful even a 5050 cotton blend
this is an excellent hair styling tool my hair is difficult to have lasting curlswaves but with this my hair style lasts for at least two daysi definitely recommend this onei give it two big thumbs up
this was an inexpensive piece to roll cones but honestly i found this to be difficult to use  its really hard to fill after rolling paper around it  it becomes a frustrating situation to the point where i roll cones by hand quicker than using this tool
seemed to really help my adrenal fatigue
cute small boxes the color pops they came very well packaged so none came in bent
no better than drugstore hot water bottle
im sorry to say that my bottle arrives busted and therefor i couldnt really use it i sopped up some of the loose liquid and worked it into a stone floor i knew exactly what i was planning to use this on so i got straight to it i just have one spot in my late 30s early 40s sears kit home that has an unsealed rough stone floor i have been wanting to find something that could clean that floor nothing ever describes what i have so i have been reticent to buy anything so i havent used anything when i saw that this product can be used on pavers bricks sidewalks etc i figured that was much closer to what i have in terms of porosity so here i am with a busted bottle and just a rags worth of product and i dab it onto one spot it really seems promising this isnt a case of oh i can use anything and i certainly cant use a power washer hm maybe a steamer but yeh i need a cleaner this could be it but i dont have enough to work with i am highly considering just buying another bottle but concerned about another broken bottle personally i think the price point is reasonable hence why i never rate on price if i do buy another bottle currently have one sitting in my cart i will be back to update
i figured id try the vanilla since i do like a couple of other flavors but this flavor is awful it doesnt even taste like vanilla
the container are only half filled and its not smooth but it seem to work on the itchy bites i used it on flea bites
i bought these for giving my baked goods to friends they are just the right size sturdy and even more beautiful in person than in the photos instead of light pink ribbons shown in the ad mine are a hot pink which makes the boxes pop to life the thank you cards are a lovely ecru color and are packaged in clear resealable plastic 2 packages of 6 the cards have matching envelopes and are the quality you would expect to find in high end boutiques this set really deserves 10 stars they can be used for so many thingstrinkets birthdays valentines day wedding showers the boxes are the perfect size and the price is very affordable for such luxury thank you amazon for this great set
the case was over all a buy it holds my mlg gunnars fine and is a nice coated leather the only issue that i would say it has is that it is kind of flimsy when opening however the magnets hold when the case is closed
neem oil is great for hair and skin it helps strengthen strands and improves elasticity it encourages hair growth and can prevent unnecessary shedding it is also good for fighting wrinkles the capsules are filled with oil you can easily puncture them with a thumbtack or sewing needle and add them to either hair or skin products another great use is to add some to your favorite clay mask to make it dry down slower i think this is a great buythanks so much for reading this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
these were hideous i tried to pawn them off and no one likes them it ended up being a food we tricked people to eat as a joke
for the price point this is an excellent cuticle nipper the edge is shard and precise comparable in quality to a 20 nipper
these are nice paper towels both with looks and function theyre thicker than any ive used and much more absorbent too they have perforations and theyre easy to tear off one but the paper towels themselves arent easily torn ive been quite pleased with them
i love camu camu for an extra vitamin c boost  i sprinkle it very lightly into shakes as such potent vitamin c has laxative powers  so start small  yay for organic

folks these earplugs pose a risk of getting stuck deep inside your ear i see from the reviews im not the only onei only wore these a couple of times one of them got stuck in my ear canal these are silicone and extremely small but dont have stemshandles like other other silicone earplugs to prevent them from adhering deep inside your ear canal if my rn friend had not been able to extract the earplug i wouldve had to go to urgent care or the er getting something like this stuck in your ear could potentially damage your hearingi urge you to buy other earplugs potentially with stemshandles youre trying to protect your hearing  not risk it
most of us know that maca is a superfood well this is amped up superfood from peru that aids the body in healing boosting the immune system and filled with amino acids that are fuel for out bodies there is no taste to it so i put a tsp in my smoothies along with maca and a warrior blend plant based protein powder that i know will give me all i need as i cant eat due to dental surgery
i was really excited to get this for my husband but the power button does not work it only turns on if i push the speed button but since that turns it on i cant change the speed if my husband tries to put any pressure on it lay his neck on it it just shuts off very disappointed
nice thick nail files
i need co to repond to this question why was label saying 50 knotweed placed over the original that says 20  which is it
husband loves this warm and cozy item  should have had one in the beginning
this spotlight toothpaste says its vegan and claims to rebuild enamel but i showed this to my dentist and she was skeptical she recommends sensodyne which has much stronger ingredients to fight tooth decay and eroding enamel i suspected as much  i didnt like the texture of this toothpaste and though it does have fluoride thank goodness i dont feel the same sensation of cleanliness i get with colgate total or sensodyne it feels very mild and there is no foaming action there are many obscure toothpastes like these on the market that claim to be healthier but i have yet to find any equivalent to whats already working for me oh well
these were surprisingly great quality and easy to put together they scratched off perfectly and were a lot of fun for the guest at our bridal shower
great in a smoothie
replaced our sound machine that we had for many years  perfect white noise
sadly as cute as they are the scent didnt last more than a day i will use them all but i dont think i will return for more
i gave a five star for this product is great the taste is hard to get used too but i mix it in 100 grape juice and it is very good the juice is good for you plus the energy greens and i feel wonderful i am 73 yrs old and i can work rings around my husband and  kids i will continue to take the all day energy greens as long as i can afford it
these little nail buffers are not just for doing nails they are great for all sorts of projects  hobbies they are just like the larger foam sanding blocks that you can get at lowes or home depot but much smaller 375 x 1  so you can have very granular control however be warned they are pretty abrasive 60 grit on one side  100 on the other so not for fine sanding overall a great deal for this large pack of sanding blocks
best spray wax on the market by a longshot the durability of other spray on rinse off products doesnt even compare to this product have had this last 6 months after properly clay barring a vehicle perfect for wheels as well
water is so important for much health reasons the flavor is very concentrated so only 12 of dropper is needed in 810 ox of waterthis brand of flavors is delicious and pure my favorite is the coconut flavor and the pineapplecoconut

love the bleach tablets though expensive for only 40 they have helped with my asthma i cant breathe in the bleach fumes and this is a way of preventing it and they are easy to use and work
the carpet in my town home is 13 years old so it has seen better days it wasnt even new when i moved in and the management doesnt offer carpet cleaning anymore the old one did they also dont replace the carpets either unless you move outso naturally i want something to refreshand with all the bad things out there trying to find a nice good refreshener is a choreseeing this i thought  why not and i found out why notthe package is atrocious the product despite having a seal sprinkled out the seal wasnt easy to remove and more product flies outlets talk about scent  if you have a problem with strong scents  stay awaysince it is just my mother and i in the household we have no small kids or pets  we sprinkled this on the carpetit says to wait 15 minutes now we only sprinkled a small area but after 5 minutes we had to get rid of it so we vacuumed it upthat made it worse omg it smelled like old tuna cans and peppermint grosseffective i cannot believe any germ would stay around with this it did lighten the carpet but i had to toss the rest of this due to the scentit is definitely not worth the 999 it is currently listed as it isnt something i would get again or recommendnow i need to find out how to get the stench out

i cant blow out a candle through this mask so theyre decent for filtering theyre comfortable on my large head they stand off my face well so theyre comfortable even in the florida heat for long term wearing the nose bar blocks off enough air that i can get a fair seal and not too much fogging of my glasses plus i like the black better than white or blue ive worn several so far and not one has failed would recommend

these are great  i bought the unflavored balms and they have a perfectly natural neutral smell to them and zero taste  they keep my lips from getting chapped and go on smoothly  i would buy these again
i feel like this is the perfect contour pillow because it lowers your heads and provide perfect support to your neck i love the design of it i wake up feeling alot more active while using this pillow the only bad thing about this pillow is it has a very strong chemical smell it wont go away for a good 24 hours i would highly recommend if you order this particular pillow please dont sleep on the night it arrive let it air out for at least 2 dayshope this helps 
not what i expected lining too light for me maybe for a jogger its fine but offers no no protection
i like this small dustpan and brush set and prefer to use it for our dining room table and my desk it helps remove the different crumbs or eraser bits more effectively than using a brush or sponge or my hand  it also is small enough to keep in a desk drawer and encourages me to tidy up
was not impressed with using this wasnt able to scrub things and have it remove the food
this is my favoite organic barley grass on the market its fresher its felt in a smoothie immediately its easy to use and its detoxing add some dulse while youre at it dulse flakes are cheap a banana 2 cups organic blueberries  3 oranges or 3 cups organic orange juice oh yum compliments of medical medium

this gel is terrific i inadvertently got a serious sunburn on my back i was at an outdoor function the sun must have been stronger than i realized because it penetrated my shirt probably the worst burn ive ever gotten this provided almost immediate relief the aloe is soothing and healing the menthol is cooling it does have a strong minty fragrance almost like a supercharged mouthwash i wish it was either unscented or lighter but the bottom line is it provides pain relief quickly and stimulates healing great stuff
comfortable and easy care
they work okay but my ear canals are super sensitive to the pressure which makes them hard to wear during sleep which is why i bought him
my cousin told me about this since my wife is taking miralax via drs orders to help her she started these about 2 weeks ago dropped the miralax and the results are great seems to be all natural she had to cut it down to half because it was working too well so far she is very happy with it other than the taste if you like figs and dates its a bit like that taste maybe little more sour and it sticks to your teeth she takes it at supper and has fruit or dessert after ti cover the taste ive tried it and do not really mind the taste other that it definitely sticks to your teeth if youre having going to the bathroom issues its definitely worth a try
these make great gifts for the jewelry lover who loves to travel
leaves pattern on food tears too easy
this oil smells like perfume it is a fragrance oil or blend not an essential oil theres no such thing as vanilla essential oil and there is no evidence whatsoever that this is any type of certified organic anything real organic actual essential oils have to be certified in the world of vanilla there are vanilla absolutes vanilla extract vanilla flavoring and vanilla fragrance oils or blends please do your research before purchasing this product this is a vanilla fragrance oil or blend that is not meant to go into a diffuser the price is also an indicator that this is not a true vanilla absolute which is what would be used in a diffuser or in soaps vanilla absolutes are expensive these are cheap and they smell cheap they do not smell anything like vanilla at all they smell like perfume not a good perfume and not a vanilla perfume i would not recommend whatever kind of oils these are at all
a little expensive but very good
this has been doing a great job at keeping my toilets clean my only complaint is that it has a bromine smell to it which reminds me of a public restroom at a swimming pool not a bad smell but definitely noticeable the time savings is worth it to me nothing an air freshener cant mask anyway
i do a lot of research before buying or trying products and its been a while since ive had a product that made me so happy  i think this is a great value productwhen i first started working with a personal trainer a few years ago one of the first things he made me buy was a foam roller34why34  i asked34so you can work out knots in your muscles  trust me youll want it34so i ordered one of those giant long big blue foam rollers that they have in gyms  it was cumbersome but it was effective  i didnt realize how tight my muscles were until i rolled on these rollers and let the weight of my body press against the roller  it was so good but so painful  and as much as i liked using it i hated storing it  i was living in a loft at the time and that thing was really unsightlythen i saw this 3 in 1 roller and was really excited to try it  the 3 in 1 roller has basically 3 rollers that stack neatly inside one another  theres the outer roller most similar to what i had before a gear shaped roller for more targeted pressure points and a rolling massage stick  its shorter but im still able to fit both legs on the roller  it also cost the same as my giant long blue tube roller  i like that its compact enough to hide from sight when not in use  i like the firmness of the large roller and small roller and the whole kit feels very sturdy and well constructed  the only slightly annoying thing is that the massage stick fits very snug into the gear roller so it takes a lot of effort to pull out and i worry whether the handle might break over time  better that than too loose and constantly falling out i guessfoam rolling works based on the idea that pressure applied to certain body parts helps to work out knots and relieve pain  until i started using foam rollers i didnt realize how many knots i had in my body  i do stretches regularly but you still dont get it all outthere are a number of great roller positions you can use  the ones i find most effective are for my quads and hamstring  you prop your roller onto your hamstrings or quads and hold a low plank with the weight centred over the roller  hold position for a few seconds at a time where you feel pain  discomfort and slowly roll up and down every part of your legs  the same concept works with calves and glutes  just roll slowly onto the roller putting as much weight as you can on the point of contact between the roller and your bodymy back and neck are often sore so ill lie on my back with the large roller tucked under my lower back and then arch backwards  with the gear roller i like propping it under my neck and pushing down on the pain pressure points  ive also run the massage stick up and down sore spots on my neck and along my shouldersoverall there are lots of uses and plenty of exercises you can look up online  its a great way to work out muscle knots and relieve soreness and tightness from exercise  it also loosens your muscles and prevents tearing  i received a review sample of this roller for my honest opinion and i wouldnt hesitate to purchase another if i were to misplace this one
grainy does not dissolve  its like sand in the bottom of a cup
just like the product from so many years ago great
srsly  im sure the buckets would be great if they were useable find a local dealer so this doesnt happen to you
i couldnt get this to spray nicely it started to spray in a stream not a mist
it works well and its aroma is for me quite pleasant follow the directions and your shoes will revive at least mine did
no complaints and no smell
as a fulltime caregiver of a person suffering the symptoms of alzheimers ive been struggling with finding good products for her dual incontinence issues  after finding a great adult diaper that holds her through the night weve noticed that the diapers have an unpleasant smell to them worth a bit of odor if i dont have to do laundry of the complete bedding 12x per day  my sister works as a medical assistant and she told me that this is what all the medical assistants keep at their desks to eliminate odors whenever an exam room needs it  i ordered this product as well as another one by a different manufacturer  hands down this is the far superiior product same as used at the hospital  while they both worked on the odor this one only takes 12 sprays in the room and the odors disappear and the best part is the small fragrance you smell once you spray goes away and it just smells fresh  i cannot recommend this product enough
my boy donut couldnt go a day without ferretone every ferret loves it
i like the price 62
i am so disappointed when i opened the package i saw these cute little purple sachets i wanted to put them in drawers and in my closet they are just that a cute sachet there is no scent whatsoever absolutely none
the ingredients in this tend to be difficult to notice as the effects arent really immediate but over time they are noticeable and offer a fantastic boost cordyceps has many benefits along with lions mane i really enjoy the full assortment in this blend and have made sure its added to my continuous use list of supplements
these are great although for tight spaces they will break off in your teeth and you have to be adventurous to get them out but otherwise they do the job they are intended to do
the brush fits perfect on my clarisonic the main reason i bought the brushes however i noticed a very strong stench coming from the brush after about 3 washes very disappointed i guess you do pay for what you get 
very big bigger than i thought it does hold a lot of oils but some of my bottles are bigger than doterra so the bigger bottles take up more space and the next area is not available therefore cutting down on the number of oils in the case i am also curious how the foam holds up or breaks down when oils get on it is there a replacement for the foam insert the case is sturdy and i appreciate the handle makes it a lot easier than the cardboard box i had them in 
not a bad pillow worth a try
this is a really nice size balloon  we didnt have any helium handy so we just filled it with air  inflates easy and held the air overnight so no issues there  great for kids birthday parties  i checked with a local store and they will fill the balloon for use for a nominal charge they said 199 same as if we bought the balloon at the store  great fun balloon
the item fit way too big and the item could not be returned to seller one hot mess

there are four black lanyards in this package the loop is too small to get my head through if i extend the pushbutton adjuster to the very end so that there is no loop meaning the inclusion of the mask on the ends will create the loop it is still too small also i cannot get any of the clasps to open to attach the masks i squeezed and squeezed and they barely budged this is complete garbage and that is where i put thisin the trash
it works
i dont know why people were complaining about set up i set my scale on a hard floor and it took me all of 10 seconds to connect it and then it told me to weigh myself it was absolutely easythe sleek design is so attractive the bottom of the scale is covered in a bubble look and it really does look futuristic this connected nicely to my fitbit and my fitness pal infact i weighed myself and it auto uploaded without me touching a button so that was niceim really glad i invested the money for this scale it seems to be accurate seeing as how i was just weighed at the doctors office 1 week ago and have lost a few lbs off that number which i am trying to do so as far as accuracy goes this seems to be right on keyi need to keep it hidden from my kids though because it says not to be used by anyone under 10 and the look is just too temptingthe display is nice it recognizes you by the account you set up and calls you by your initials you can also set up multiple users i am really happy with this purchase  so far update may 6 2014  got on the scale this morning and it read one weight  which i thought was impossible  so i got back on  it was 4 lbs down  huh  got on again 2 lbs up  got on again  12 lbs down  this scale is messed up and i am returning it  i know my body fluctuates but not like this and not in a 5 min time frame  the scale integrates nicely with mfp but make sure you watch it for inconsistencies mine is a white one  and i originally really liked it  however ive weighed myself only a handful of times since i got it and it fluctuates like mad
nice to have the different sizes it does crumble a pill with a heavy coating but you cant stop that the blade could be a little stronger
buy it great natural energy
i own and have been using straight razors for years i figured i would try a shavette for those times when i dont feel or have the time to strop or touch up the edge on the standard straight edge i bought two of them to see which one i would like both are the 34push type34this one is all coated metal and is heavier than my standard straights even heavier than my spartacus str8s but the main reason i am writing this review is how even the blade sits in this unit with this unit the blade fits perfectly even in the holder the heavier metal really holds the blade in place beautifully tight and perfectly exposed the other shavette i got was the cut throat with a multi colored wood handle from ebay for 15the handle was nice but the blade holder metal was quite a bit thinner and the edge of the blade was not evenly exposed that is because the two metal edges where the blade comes through are not even one edge is higher than the other and not parallel from one side to the other as the metal is thin i tried to bend the two edges so they would line up better no luck once metal is bent it is hardened summary this matte slide out is a higher quality unit with quality control that is necessary for the blade to be exposed evenly  fun to shave with and convenient
i bought these to wear when i take my contacts out  fyi they are a little wide  i am a girl and i think they are meant for big headed boys    all the same i love the style  just wish they were a little bit tighter at the temples  the appear to be good quality and i dont see any distortion in the lens
this beet root powder smells like dirt and the taste is very strong and not good  ive tried mixing it with other flavors but havent been able to mask the bad flavor  further  even though ive ingested it anyway  ive noticed no results as far as increased energy or anything else  will not purchase this ever again
received it the other day  wore it last night so many problems with it i have very sensitive skin  particularly the chin section created a rash on my chin  no matter what i did it would slip up over my mouth the openings for the ears were not even close to where my ears are it did keep my mouth closed because the chin material kept covering it but there was nothing there that i can rave about  waste of money  is now in the trash
great price for so many i love dreft use it on regular clothes not just the babies stuff it literally gets out most stains we have from wine to spaghetti sauce and everything kids can get into in between like slime and dirt
these storage containers are smaller than i expected but they still work well for bringing food to work or school in a lunch bag they work well for salads pasta rice and small quantities of other leftovers the lids fit securely but go on and off easily the containers are easy to clean since they are dishwasher safe on the top shelf this item comes with a total of thirty containers in six sets of five
great quality
i bought this for my granddaughter and my daughter gets stopped all the time asked where she got it  i fits her well and she looks darling in it
in theory i love this product however it really didnt work that well maybe its cuz i wear makeup but i feel like half the world words make up
bone marrow is a very good source of nutrition that most people no longer get me included  i didnt even know about the health benefits of bone marrow until a few short months ago  when i saw this supplement available for review i wanted to try it  i think its very good and very high quality  i just cant deal with taking 4 capsule of it each day  i will have to bust them open and pour the contents into soups or something  i have other forms of bone marrow supplements that i like better such as a thick gravy kind that is already seasoned and all i have to do is spoon it into a casserole meatloaf soup etc and stir it in before cooking it  and i have a bone marrow supplement thats chocolate flavored that i can mix up in a smoothie  all are good forms and if you have no trouble swallowing pills or capsules i think this would be a great choice
i was trying to find a basic sticker to put on my granddaughters books to say who they were from and when i do not know what i was thinking buying these they would be awesome for a invitation or something like that too fancy and pricey for a label my fault 
product well described by seller construction is sound with no nails protruding hinge works well this essential oil box is exactly what i needed to house my eo bottles ranging from 5 to 15 ml would recommend the purchase of this box to a friend
not as good as extra strength thoughi normally use the extra strengthand after taking thesei did notice they were not as good
best bug repellent especially great on sensitive skin with a pleasant oder
not the beat quality they were different sizes and thickness
great protein bars great flavor
run smaller than ad photo but works
the first issue was that the soap didnt come out of the wand easily solved by poking a larger hole in the soap wand using a paring knife second issue was that even after creating a larger opening for soap to come out the sponge was too thickdense for the soap to saturate sufficiently again an easy fix  i simply used my paring knife to make a small slit in the center of the sponge at this point despite having to make these minor adjustments i was still ok with the product because hey this scrubber is always in my sink and i always have a knife that needs cleaning so despite the fact that a product should perform as intended without the need for alterations the literal 5second investment was worth it in a world where scotchbrite refills have apparently gone the way of the dodo but i digress the real issue  and this one is insurmountable  is that the flipping sponge pops off of the little bracket that attaches it to the wandeverysingletime honestly i hate stinky sponges that sit in and around sinks so much that i actually thought about purchasing some sort of waterproof glue to reattach the sponges to the bracketsbut i mean cmon anyway total pass on this one
perfect for what i needed great price as well  i even ordered a second one after receiving the first one  pill cutter and grinder are very easy to use  and the travel case is perfect for keeping extra meds i may need in my car 
this gave me a swollen eye and ridiculous lashes that curled on themselves all the way back to my eyelidthe sticky rods tore my skin open there was a little piece of my skin stuck to the rod and a hole on my eyelid wtf removing the super sticky rods caused my lids to bruise all along the lashlinethen my eye swelled up either because of the trauma or because of product getting into the wound either way bad newseyes are delicate dont mess with thisno ingredients listed no brand to complain to this is imported from china with no consumer safety guarantees
i was very pleased with my order  i ordered this for a friend  my friend really liked the poster  my order arrived in a timely manner
the taste is good the ingredients are healthy and ketofriendly other than sucralose i have consumed bulletproof coffee regularly for years so i am used to this type of coffee one issue is the price which is currently 350 per cup if you have four cups per day that is 14 per day and this pack will only last five days you can make coffee at home add your own butter mct oil and collagen at a cost of 040  1 per cup where this product makes sense is when you are away from home such as in the office or while traveling for that use case this product is good spending 350 on a cup of coffee is too much thoughthe other issue is that this product is not ketofriendly since it has sucralose which will spike insulin the amount of sucralose in this is not disclosed
description was worded unclear product is of good quality and im assuming if i was pregnant would be helpful but for my situation was not applicable
wow cleaned my bbq so beautifully plus my two wood stoves and the bricks around them
this smells almost rotten like something in it has gone bad  i couldnt stand the smell so i threw it away and got a different brand
i thought maybe i goofed and these insoles were for a childs shoe  they are so narrow and smalli put my heel in and the front part barely comes to the ball of my foot  and so narrow that the edges are uncomfortable on the sides of my feetnot worth the effort to even peel and stick them into my shoe
this is a great pill container i have one and purchased another for a friend the look is very classy and great to throw in the suitcase or purse when traveling
love these  i am a nurse and my arms get cold but i am too hot with a full shirt  these r perfect  look really nice and well made  highly recommended
it is a strong astringent so is great for oral health tightening gums i dilute three drops in a teaspoon of water to swish and then dab a little on my deepest wrinkles it is reducing them a lot how funny it looks like blood and would stain but outside the dumb name it is great stuff
the jar is neutral in color and attractive but the best thing about it is that i dont have to strike repeatedly to get the matches to light the stickon paper is a surprisingly effective striking surface
great stuff for all stomach issues  works great on dogs as well healed my bulldogs stomach
i like using the heart rate monitor thats the only thing i liked its kinda bulky and only has time in military form the app sucks i didnt understand a thing on it just the settings that was the main reason why i didnt like it so i decided to just buy the new fitbit ulta im still keeping the morefit though because of the heart rate
glucosamine from viva labs is an excellent product with triple strength i am so happy i got this product at an excellent price of 299 and free shipping it is unbeatable try it and you will experience the difference
works well easy to setup very accurate use it with hoyer lift and sling to weigh wheelchair bound person that cant stand on a normal scale
i really really love it perfect  size and i love the color
discreet packaging padded envelope that makes it appear as toolsheads up if it gets hard to blow through its from overuse and it just needs to dry off
when i first got this gel i thought that there was no way it was going to work but it does and it is a large tube so you get your moneys worth i have spinal stenosis and the weather is changing which means that i have more pain than normal but this gel has eased my joint pain i recommend to everyone who suffers from arthritis joint pain stenosis or even fibromyalgia  i received this item either free or greatly discounted since i am a nation wide product tester and my testimony is true and unbiased
what i like about this gauze is that is is soft stretchy and goes on without much fuss unlike standard gauze which is not soft not stretchy and falls off while you are trying to wrap it and you cuss a lot as your wounds weep or worse bleed and you have to start all over again and then you just sit in a pile of crappy gauze crying in frustrationbut not this gauzealso very nicely priced
i should have read more reviews they dont come with instructions or ingredients or anything and look like someone took a larger pack and separated it into smaller ones manually previously wed gotten some from our dentist and the instructions were to chew one tablet she did  and it was terrible the taste almost made her throw up and then it stained her lips teeth tongue and our sink copious amounts of dye i did wash out the sink with soap eventually but i had to brush her teeth quite a bit to get the purple off and her tongue is still purple and she has purple spots on her face im now worried about an allergic reaction after reading the review where the child had breathing problems ill be watching her carefully tonight they did disclose plaque but for our needs they wont work 7 wasted very disappointed
i cannot use it its crammed into the case it came in and cannot be removed broke carry case to get i out i bought this for the carry casethe file is nice just the case is the issue
these gloves do exactly what theyre made to do protect your hands from dirt grime and water the gloves are comfortable however just a tad too big i have long fingers so the length is perfect but they are a little baggy no worries they still work well for washing dishes and general cleaning around the house be sure to note that only the teal gloves are flocked and the pink and white gloves are not im fine with either but that may cause an issue to others
back support
i like them so much that i got some for my kids and signif other  found that i really only need one per day though  great product
definitely dont drink it straight from the bottle burned my throat and it was sore for three days
i recently broke my left fibula and bought this to be able to put my shoes on and its one of the best amazon purchases i ever made i love how it is adjustable and it works perfectly then i twisted my right knee and had to get this back out now i keep it on a hook in a designated place because its that valuable to me now
do not play fetch with this as i can see it getting lodged in your dogs throat if caught wrongmy pups seem to enjoy chewing on this i have medium sized dogs they did however chew off a very small piece of this productmaking me reduce the stars any dig chew where the dog can easily chew off the product is not good as the dog will swallow it
just as pictured good quality
these lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck but they can only be hooked onto masks that have a very thin elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end the cord is sufficiently long and can be cinched tighter or looser around the neck if needed i felt it was roomy enough cinched partway downthe chains are colorful and work well the current price of 599 is excellent for this as it comes to 120 per lanyard i really like fun color of these chains however my absolute favorite mask chain is  which is more than 12 times the price but is also an eyeglass chain jewelry and a mask holder
i bought these for my daughter and her family i put their names in between the designs and it turned out so cute my son in law 2 granddaughters and my daughter wore their christmas hats all day on christmas day they loved them they are so different from the usual red christmas hats with the white trimming i had bought them another set but they liked these better i bought the lettering from amazon too so cute wish i knew how to take and photo and download to the section to add photos
this is something i have been adding to my smoothies and in that situation the flavor works fine i dont like the taste well enough to just mix with milk but in my vanilla yogurt frozen blackberries splash of apple juice smoothies it is just fineas far as pain relief i havent noticed any at all i have an autoimmune arthritis which the reason i tried this but havent had any reduction in pain this probably takes time to work like glucosamine does i intend to keep using it and will update
great bottles
this is much bigger than i thought it would be  it has held up pretty well
i love the colors and that we can store 4 batteries in each case and we can also attach them together i think this is a great buy if you need to take batteries with you or simply store them organized
i found method foaming body wash 2 years ago when i broke my wrist i had to use a plastic sleeve to shower and it was difficult to handle a bar of soap and washcloth with the other hand i read a suggestion about body wash and i found this in the grocery market the one i found was the green one and i really loved it  i cant find it anywhere now but found this orange one here on amazon the green was sold out but the orange was available i was happy to grab a couple of them because i dont know if or when ill see them again its really nice stuff
these worked great sturdy and inexpensive
ive only been taking these for a few days now  i have noticed that im not doing my usual afternoon snacking  just dont want anything in the afternoon anymorei do eat a light breakfast before i take the pillsit did take about 2 days before i started noticing my hunger going down a bitif you can easily swallow pills then youll have no problem with these  if you have a gag reflex then these might be a little problem  pills are a little bit in my opinionwill try to do an update in a month
i ordered several of these in different colors for review including the one in  and they are all junk and stick in place all had to be thrown outthis black one is as terrible a pill case as the other colors the door is difficult to open and the chamber was stuck on saturday and a half i cannot even use this not to mention if i could i would not be able to see the pills i threw this out avoid like the plague
sized for children or smaller adults durable for the price
these earplugs recommended by the wirecutter have a lot of potential  the design is functional and ascetically pleasing and there are several sizing options in both the rubber and foam tips which is great  im still working through the options to figure out what size is the best fit for my ears and i havent landed on the perfect solution yet but hopefully with all of the available options i should be able to find the right fit  given the variety im sure most people would be able to find an option that works well for their ears which is one of the nice benefits of this product over many of the competing options
this tens unit is by far the best i have terrible chronic pain and not much at all has helped me this helps me relax so much and gives me relief thank you so much for making this product i highly recommend it if you are looking for great quality and pain relief then this is your device
not just for kids i love these wont wipe my ass without them they are fragrance free and not harsh at all never have a problem with them flushing
these are too big to provide any compression ive also tried sbsox copper compression and roxofit all ordered based on their individual sizing recommendations for my 8 arches these by far fit the largest in size small they are designed more like the sbsox style which is longer and extends the length of the metatarsal region this is good for people with longer feet but these have a thick seem that looks like it would be uncomfortable too i ordered these because they came in flesh tone and had to return the copper compression flesh tone ones due to poor construction quality but i can not recommend these and they are going back immediately without me even trying to wear them to see if they are supportive
the locking mechanism gave way after first trip without it its just an expensive plastic bag i will not buy this again
very heavy i wouldnt wear these out of the house until i am able to keep them in for sure
very good price looks great  the round shape is of good size  vision is clear glasses look durable
this cavalier matches the one i have in real life  holds my glasses so i can find them easily its a good weight too it really is a cute art piece
packaged well great item for the price  arrived promptly
not bad but is slightly too low for me in lateral position the customer support seems helpful though and suggested to try two pillows on top of each other i will give it a try
use this in my bubble bars and it works great
the gel is really refreshing
i purchased these for the charcoal bristle brushes i received the package there are white bristle brushes and charcoal bristle brushes in the package they all have different letters but they dont tell you if the letters stand for the different softness levels of the brushes or what they represent the brushes loose their bristles after about the first 10 brushes so theyre definitely disposable i am keeping them for guests to use but not what i was hoping for
the smell is a bit weird however i am so fond of the fact that it is a silky lotion consistency and not a nasty stinging oil  this product is great but you may wish to wash your hands after using it  or add a medicinal therapeutic grade quality organic essential oil fragrance to it in order to mask the scent  over all though i highly recommend the product it works fast 
i like these containers and they did not leak when i filled them with my hippy sunblock brew  however only four stars because this set doesnt really screw back down
i didnt like the taste of this at all and ended up giving it away
nice on nose
i found these in my local grocers used them and fell in love i understand the negative reviews since in todays society faster and simpler is deemed better but i believe in working at least a little harder if you want the best results in any area of our lives the glue flap requires attention and care to close it properly and the results are excellent i just bought out one supplier here at amazon and ill be looking for more i love this quickasteam product and i thank the inventors and manufacturers who have made my dinnertimes much faster safer and more delicious
ive been watching a lot of kdramas lately and the characters often take these supplements in small pouches  i was interested in trying this calcium jelly supplement  the calcium supplement is expensive at around 2 per pouch but it is much tastier than the large calcium pills that i normally take  the supplement is a mix of jelly and fruit leather texture and has a sweet pomegranate taste  the supplement doesnt have sugar or water but it has a nice light burnt sugarcaramel and pomegranate taste
dont be afraid to switch hands if one eyes application gives you more trouble than the other
pros1 plenty of different strains of beneficial bacteria in adequate amountscons1 these supplements do not have an enteric coating in order to allow the probiotic bacteria to reach the colon alive2 this product is not listed on the companys website though it is promoted on their facebook page3 intestinal fortitude if was founded about eight years ago in williamsburg virginia it is a very small company whose supplements including this one are undoubtedly produced by a much larger company which specializes in manufacturing supplements unfortunately if has not openly disclosed on its website the name of the manufacturer of its products including this one4 if states on its website that their ingredients are sourced from around the world though their supplements are bottled in the usa
i wore these to work hoping they would provide my left ankle with the bracing it needs as i suffer from an old tendon tear that flares up when i do a great deal of walking andor when the weather is extremely hot or if there is a quick shift in the weather  i tore the tendon that runs along the outside of my left foot  and when i say tore i literally heard a crack when it tore  it was so loud and such a crisp sound i thought id broken a bone  anyway it took a very long time to heal and because it is a tendon it did not heal back the same as new  it hurts and feels as if it could give way when the weather is muggy hot and when ive walked quite a bit  i mention this because thats why i ordered this brace for my left ankle  and again i wore these to work and while they are like wearing compression socks which are better than nothing on my foot they have to bracing effect  i even had kinseology tape wrapped around that ankle as well  ah well  short compression socks with my toes free are fine
most ultra healthy foodstuffs do not taste good this powder is ok mainly because it blends in with whatever you choose to mix it with like tofu it is bland on its own but its fairly tasty when mixed with something else i appreciate the fact that its organic and nongmo but this is one of these superfood powders that best benefit those who dont eat enough fruits and vegetables i do so i dont feel im missing that much by not ingesting something with noni fruit in it its ok but i wouldnt order it again
and this wonderful stuff prevents rashes sores redness from her diaper undies i love that it has no petrol chemicals or other toxic garbage i thank god for the honest company
these are well flavored drops  i used it for vape juice flavoring and my husband enjoyed the flavor and had no complaints
i had high hopes for this product but alas i was dissatisfied i found it necessary to reapply the product every 4560 minutes i would not repurchase this product
this hibiclens hand pump took a ridiculously long time to arrive and the straw does not reach the bottom of the bottle while i was waiting for this to arrive i purchased two clear  pump dispenser bottles which arrived the following day they take up less space than a 32oz bottle cost less and are a more attractive option save your money
i nice love them
this has a very weird taste i like the chocolate and vanilla the company itself was great
seller is advertising product as easy to swallow they are not these capsules are almost an inch long and about 125 inches in circumference they are among the largest if not the largest capsules i have come across so i measured them many older people have trouble swallowing and these could very well be dangerous for them i have a smallish throat so i bought these believing the 34easy to swallow34 advertising which i find deceiving will not purchase again
marine collagen was better for me
i chose this because it is a dk combo and encapsulated in fat here is why   k helps you absorb the d and both d  k are fat soluble vitamins  for about a year now we have been using dk combos in our bulletproof coffee in the morning more fat for absorption  both my husband and i have had our d checked and we are both slightly over 100  with the present climate one wants to be over 75  if one has an autoimmune one wants to be as close to 100 without going over  when i first started last year i was tested at 41  which is normal but not high enough for certain things  that was considering i already took a standard d supplement and we were very much outdoorsy people  most people just do not not realize they are deficientso  all that said  i appreciate this product  we still use it in our coffee  it seems to work well and keeps out levels where we need  we have gotten our d checked about every 6 months  no regrets here
fantastic product  i have never had anything work faster or better
very good shisha first time trying fantasia love it especially the rainbow flavor
ive been through several nebulizers now this is the best so farcompletely silent works greati love it
i was looking a pair of calf compression sleeves for my running sessions and these ones are great id buy them again
this set of dental tools comes in a metal case and includes six different tools four of the six are scraping or pick tools one is a mirror and the other a large tweezers im not a dentist or hygienist and honestly i have no idea what to do with several of these tools including the tweezers but the scraping tools work very well for my intended purpose which is to clean my teeth between dentist visits i dont like the feel of plaque and tartar building up on my lower front teeth and with these tools i can gently remove some of it to keep my teeth feeling clean and healthy the tools are weighty made of quality stainless steel and for a nonprofessional like me are perfect especially given the low price
my dentist introduced me to this line of products some years back and i had been using the mouthwash and the oral irrigation rinse for use with my water pic ever since then but had never tried the breath spray or the toothpaste i also recently went on a vacation where i was not able to bring my mouthwash and i had really missed itthis was a wonderful way to get introduced to the other products in the line that i hadnt yet tried and to have some travel products available for the next time i go on vacation so that i dont have to do withoutthe packaging is excellent and seems very sturdy yet its easy to get into when i want to use and i really like the breath spray which seems to actually neutralize issues rather than just cover them up with a squirt of mint
dont go without it
this stuff works great on left on forever grease messes by the stove
i used crest for many many years  i was getting tired of it even though it is just toothpaste  i switched to colgate a few years ago and i find the taste is pleasant  the only issue is i think the tubes have really shrunk throughout the years
i bought this because i have arthritis in my right thumb and it hurts to use a regular fingernail clipper  i can effortlessly cup my nails  its such a relief  the only thing i didnt like is the size of the cutting mechanism  its a little large  its better suited  for clipping toenails than fingernails
i ordered this for my grandpa who moves around the house in his wheelchair this was great for transition in floor from hallway to kitchen as he had trouble moving on the threshold we liked it so much we are ordering another one for another area in the house
i used the whole bottle and didnt notice any change
i have owned many different pill cutters over the years and this is the best one ive ever used by far it is constructed of medicalgrade bpafree plastic and its stainlesssteel blade is thin and sharp this allows it to cut pills in half without turning them into crumbs and dust which happens all too often when such blades are too wide and too dullit is typical for pill cutters to have a vshape for holding pills of various sizes in place so that is not in itself a unique feature however what is a new feature to me at least is that this pill cutter provides a highly visible painted line running down the center of the v space this mark allows the user to accurately position pills which contain an indented break line in their center such that this break line is in alignment with the cutters blade this makes it additionally likely that this particular type of pill will be split cleanly in half with no wasted crumbsthis pill cutter is conveniently larger than any other pill cutter ive owned which are usually about 1inch x 25inch in size this one is 15inch x 35inch making it easier to handle for anyone who suffers from arthritisfinally as an extra little plus this handy device is surprisingly attractive due to its sleek design and the fact that it is a pleasing aqua colorall in all i find this to be an excellent product that i would not hesitate to recommend to family or friends
i got this for my toddler who sometimes have a hard time to self sooth  at bedtime this ball has a vibrating  press button that is removable it uses a battery it doesnt  come with one thou my baby is not fond of the vibration so i took it out we have been using it and he has been doing excellent  at bedtime i like iti will suggest  removing  the vibrating  button if you are not using it because  its heavy and if you have more than one kid using it as a play throw ball you dont want the vibrating  button  hitting  your kids its painful
anyone doing cancer therapy should drink this seriously check out their site online
did not fit the pedegg model i have the value and quality was great but sadly i had to return them
works okcould get the same product for cheaper price
this gat to be one of my favorites product for babies its easy to use and definitely gets the nasal passages open for baby i recommend it
i remembered this alcohol scent from when i was a kid our home was filled with extra stuff too much to fit in a medicine cabinet so this was on the 3 tier shelf just outside the bathroom this was a different alcohol with a great scent years later i found it again in a beauty supply store and still loved it and used it like i did regular alcohol id also apply to my underarms instead of deodorant when id be home to help keep me smelling fresh and feeling cool
just what i wanted
i purchased this as a gift for my daughtershe loves it and says it works great
maybe its just me but this makes a thick layer on the nails in one respect its good because i dont have to soak it off instead it peals off in one piece and doesnt last more than a day or two but since im not paying 6000 a pop to do my own nails i cant really complain you get what you pay for
this cushion is great and is made out of the same great material developed by purple for their purple bed i recommend their cushion as much as i recommend their bedthis cushion measures 1834x1634 it is perfect for smaller chairs in the kitchen or smaller computer chairs i personally am using mine in my car dodge durango for comfort i find that is is quite comfortable but i wish it was a little bit bigger i would recommend if you are using this for a bigger computer chair or vehicle seat get the cushion that is the next size up which would be the ultimate purple cushiondimensions are 1834x1634x234 inside of the included washable coverprosreally comfortable for 48 hours of sittingdoesnt smellincluded coverconskind of small made more for smaller chairs 12 a staradditional considerationstake a look at the purple bed and the other cushions they are great they also have a new kickstarter out for their purple pillow which i expect will also be greatoverall 455 stars 625 rounds up 605 rounds down 62 5 starsif you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and i will get back to you as soon as possible
these are made for the dallas cowboy fan but the star logo is a pretty design for a ziploc bag even if youre not a fan ziploc bags are so versatile  i use these to take snacks to work for freezing leftovers and as a disposable shake and bake bag just fill one with breadcrumbs and dump your eggsoaked pork chop or chicken leg shake then put the meat in the oven each bag is easy to seal and its hard to tear  the bags are neither too thick nor too thin which makes them ideal for storing food items overall im happy with it
this is very similar to every other collagen powder i have tried but it does have a hard time mixing in
easier to put on once on your feet get so hot i couldnt tolerate then and had to take them off a couple hours after putting them on
by far out of so many masks ive purchased the best mask ever i dont have an exceptionally large face but most others aside from the paper masks leaves my double chin  so obvious this tucks under goes high has the metal piece for the bridge of the nose and allows you to unfold as much or little as you want expensive but so worth it
ive bought others but this one fits hand better when applying vs those that feel like they are size of baseball mitt
took it once and made me very sick yuck and no returns
they work awesome doesnt pull on your nose hairs like some trimmers
great bath pillow never had any issues with suction cups like with previous pillows  its lasted for a few years and still going strong
i purchased 4 of these from amazon after i purchased one for our 4 month old at a boutique and our big kids fell in love with them and begged me to get them each one we have the pink purple tealgreen tealblue and the orangeyellow they are all so cute and feel so good also they work great for cradle cap
very little product not worth what i paid
i know pure coconut milk tends to clump but i would rather have clumping than have other ingredients included to prevent clumping my body doesnt like the starches added it adulterates the taste as well
i used it once and it worked fine i stored it outside in a storage bench and the next time i pulled it out the dustpan was completely warped and no longer usable what a waste it was brand new
no batteries to worry about
love these elderberry gummies whatever i can do to help my immune system during this pandemic is a plus the taste is pleasant vegetarian and gmo free is also a plus
too super long for it to arrive  i guess because it came directly from china  the case itself is ok  its not a solid hard case  it has the strength of lets say a shoe box that has been covered with material
keeping screens glasses and face shields is a never ending chorethese wipes do a through job without leaving streaks or filmso nice not to have to go back and try to polish again
very nice little organizer a bit bigger than i needed since i dont wear a lot of jewelry but will help me make sure my jewelry doesnt get lost in the bottom of my bag when i travel
this stuff is hot folks we were used to the regular green stuff and the max freeze this promixhas a lot of menthol in it my physical therapist recommended cutting it with some good lotion we did and it works great you can make 2 tubes out of one if you can stand it right out of the tube you are much tougher than we are lol
hard to tell if its actually working but from ask appearances its keeping my bathroom air clean of germs and mold spores it at least does a decent job of eliminating odors i think and its a comforting presence to know its always whirring away
