"I experienced vision loss and needed to cover up one of my eyes for the muscles to rest. I was so tired of wearing a different eyepatch that was very rough and uncomfortable on my eye.When I got these, it was a noticeable difference in comfort. These feel like silk on your eye. Even though my eye was protruding a little bit due to swelling, they fit comfortably over it and allowed me to function. I also liked that the strap around your head was not super tight. I would definitely recommend these over the harder plastic ones!",human
"Was hoping this would help with the pain in the ball of my foot, but it ended up hurting me more from the elastic around the pad. The pain from this overrode the pain in my foot and caused more pain for me. Very uncomfortable and will need to find something else. What a waste of money!",human
"I would like to order a corn bag with more ""pockets"".  This is  a little shorter than I expected.  I may contact seller to ask for a longer one.  These are very easy to warm in microwave and comfortable to use.",human
Always liked this brush,human
Wonderful Pink Floyd hat. My husband loves it! Perfect fit. Thank you.,human
Great!!,human
Best glass cleaner ever!,human
My naturopath recommended this for me. I put it in my morning smoothies and don’t taste it at all.,human
The brush heads don’t last for long. Get a new brush with the attachments or get the brush heads made by aquasonic.,human
This sleeve fits comfortably and provides plenty of support and compression to relieve my knee pain.  I've tried others that were not nearly as comfortable.,human
"I like the longer length, and I like the snap closure.  I would have prefered the old fashioned ties, but I do not like velcro, so I take whatever I can get.  lol The bibs are not absorbent much at all.  They do protect my clothing!",human
I really enjoy DripDrop when needed.  I can't locate this product in my area so I order from Drip Drop through Amazon.  It's purpose is to hydrate and  I think it works well.,human
"I just love these, I had water dripping down my arms and now this is no longer a problem. Washing my face ,hair ,and hands doesn't require a change of clothes. I gave one to a girlfriend and she just raves about them.",human
"We were given a jar of this, I didn't even think to check Amazon that it would be listed here. None the less, this works for us...for all that is mentioned on the jar. In the future we will order from Amazon, as it's cheaper on this site over ordering from the Amish orgin site, even the shipping is less too.We both have knee joint pain, this works to relive the discomfort from arthritis. Most all of the other aches and pains we come to have with age. We have also used this for colds and sore throats too.",human
"I added additional items to it , but they are so perfect & sturdy! Super light weight which I love !",human
"I read some great reviews about this product before I purchased it. Honestly, it's the only reason I was comfortable trying the product. I was excited to try it. I've been searching for a solution for my snoring. I've had several nasal surgeries and it has gotten pretty bad I must admit.First, it didn't fit in my nose, maybe my nostrils are too close together? I'm not sure. But when I did get it to fit, it was extremely uncomfortable.Full disclosure, I did not wear it to bed so I'm unsure if it would affect snoring or not. Sorry.",human
They made my stomach very upset & the pills were very dusty and chalky.,human
"I really liked this product because you can use it on ANY jewelry ( although I haven’t tried marcasite because of the liquid properties) so I bought it again. It is not chemical I believe and does not harm pearls or costume jewelry ( fashion) yet you can do gold and diamonds.  I clean quite a bit of jewelry. I still recommend a silver polishing cloth( jewelry polishing cloth) for most silver to keep the natural beauty of the oxidation, or “ tarnish” that is sometimes intentionally put there. This is very gentle on silver though, unlike the dips and cleaners that strip away the beauty of the silver.",human
The flavor and crunchiness is perfect! The price is also excellent for these. I will definitely order again.  I have not found anything at the store that compares.,human
"It was just too complex for me to figure out how to do. But, just because I couldn't figure it out, doesn't mean you won't. I give it a rating of  stars",human
"Junk. Didn't even last a year before it just randomly stopped workingwon't charge. Too bad, I actually liked it until this.",human
outstanding product if you have bp issues this will help you,human
I've already written reviews before on this product.  Stop asking for reviews.  If I order it more than once it must at the very least be OK.,human
Great Item,human
"I very rarely wore sneakers or athletic shoes prior to the pandemic as no matter what brand I bought (Dr. Scholl’s; Etnies; Reebok; Skechers) they hurt my feet. I even tried gel inserts – nothing would help.I often, and with great success, wore flip flops. I wore them at theme parks, at a racetrack, running errands.But, I still craved the security of a sneaker.I decided to get these, and thought they’d work.The BIGGEST issue – no guidelines to cut the insert. And, for what they’re charging paying customers (I got a complimentary review product) – that is really unacceptable. Even the cheap Dr. Scholl’s have guidelines.As far as comfort? These inserts were a tad too stiff and rough. With my feet already having issues – I didn’t want to wait a good two weeks to see how well they worked. Then again, due to the pandemic – that two weeks might be months as I don’t go out. I mostly due curbside, drive-thru, or delivery for what I need.Given the mixed reviews – I don’t think I’d get these again and I would caution against anyone I personally know, purchasing them.",human
Absolutely didn’t help or feel comfortable at all.,human
Over the course of a year I’ve purchased three different insoles with the main reason searching for  great arch support. These insoles are by far the best I’ve found for that reason. As a result of a back injury I developed a drop foot and have a fallen arch in my right foot. These insoles help with that problem better than any I’ve purchased yet. I will be buying more of these insoles now that I’ve found that they are the best for my situation.,human
"It works, but it leaves a film",human
"These are lightweight, comfortable and flexible.The perfect reading glasses.I am disappointed that they are difficult to find.",human
This product was very beneficial to me providing energy boost and decrease in physical pain I was experiencing. Great taste and convenient packaging.,human
Always leaves spots no matter how much I use.  I don’t like it but have to use the rest of it.  Won’t purchase again,human
Great idea! Would’ve given five stars if you could adjust size for the kids but keeps up w our goofy face masks!,human
I use these for my prenatal vitamins. I can tell such a huge difference with out them.,human
Smells great. Taste good. Works really well!,human
"Product is above average but all kits should include a ""includes checklist"".  Meaning that there's an inventory of things and an easy way to check off what has been used.",human
"It's very cushioning; however, it's very slippery, it made my heels slip out with every step I take.",human
"Love the size and convenience, don’t love that it shuts off randomly even when battery is charged",human
"These are really good probiotics. My GF has problems with acid-reflux and I suggested this to her. She felt improvement the first day! She had tried one other of my probiotics which I've reviewed (discounted purchase) and didn't like the other brand (made her feel constipated) but she is a convert to the Power Pearls. She forgot to take them for  days and her reflux symptoms returned.Best of the  we've tried, and easy to swallow.",human
Not worth the money they are like cardboard,human
Best dishwasher detergent on the market !,human
Awesome..blocks out all sounds and so comfortable..I don't even feel them in my ears.,human
"These bags rip open easily, either when trying to open them to put them in the compost can or when taking them back out, full of stuff. We use them in a  gallon can so they’re not overfull.",human
"The electric brush works surprisingly well.  And it does not burn hair or scalp.  The minor design flaw is that when using, it is easy to accidentally click on the optional mister.  But typically, a bit of mist is appreciated...",human
It works,human
"Great for a quick stretch. . Exactly what I was looking for. Only thing I could say that is in the neighborhood of bad is that I had to go out and buy eye hole screws.  Not a biggie, in no way was a surprise and in no way affects the product or its listing.",human
"Tasty, refreshing, fun, no stevia aftertaste.I am really enjoying the orange flavor; it reminds me of Tang. Just bought Blue Raspberry to try, too.I eat keto and find these drinks useful. Am using the mixed drink to make popsicles, granitaand gelatin squares, too.",human
It works!,human
transaction and product were perfect,human
If you're trying to turn your sink into a Jackson Pollock painting it's great; not so much for teeth.,human
Warning it's a chemical to be used by professionals,human
I got it for my mother in law and my self. We loved it because it's long and our sleeves don't get wet and it's comfortable.,human
Ginseng has delivered several beneficial results. Morning sickness? Pickled ginseng from the grocery refrigerated section and supplements keep it at bay. Monotonous low energy? Ginseng.Ginsenosides are a natural steroid group exclusive to the Panax genus of ginseng. It acts as an anti-inflammatory. -% concentrations are natural in Panax. % would be a 3x concentration.Always reliable. Nice value. Seems like a quality source.,human
The idea of being able to hang the readers on my neck without a chain caught my attention and this feature works really well. I also love that these readers are blue light blocking. Great value for quality!,human
These are great.  We use them in a ceiling fan.  They are standard base and are dimmable.,human
"I like this memory book.  It's got all the pages I'd hoped for and it's really cute.  The only drawback is that it begins to look full and bulging when items are added.  For instance, I've added ticket stubs, photos, etc. and it's now big.  My daughter is only four months old, and it's already looking overfilled.  I actually don't mind much, but if you're wanting a pristine-looking baby book AND want to add items and mementos, you're probably better off doing an actual scrapbook.",human
"I thought these bands were elastic. It is difficult to put it on alone as sometimes the metal part hits the mask where the earloop starts and may snap off the earloop. Once on, they do increase the sealing of the kn95 mask.",human
This stuff lasts forever!! Best part is you can refill the bottles too!!,human
"Collagen is a fantastic supplement for so many reasons! It's great for your hair, skin, nails, gut, immune system, and more! This powder is super easy to incorporate into your diet. My favorite way to take it is to blend it into my morning protein smoothie. It virtually disappears and you'd have no idea it was even there. You can also add it to both hot and cold drinks, sprinkle it on your yogurt, add it to soup, bake with it, etc... It's super easy to sneak into almost anything. This powder is nice and fine and seems to be nice quality. This is a little more expensive than other varieties I've seen though. Usually you can get a 1lb tub of collagen powder for about the same price as this and this is only  ounces, so it's not the best deal, but it does seem to be good quality.",human
"Good product, but the color of pills is different from the last bottle I got. Not sure why",human
Perfect little shovels as they are called in our house! Thank you for a good product,human
Best non greasy sun protection spray. Easy to apply and effective. Though expensive.,human
"These did not pop no matter what the kids tried.  They do have the strongest suction cups ever, so the kids had great fun sticking it to their faces and bodies.",human
"From performance to quality to color, I like them.Thank you.",human
It works in combination with other herbs I have managed to get hold of in my own country so very pleased.,human
It sucks that this doesn't suck enough to be effective. I'm so disappointed. And itchy.,human
I love it and have used it all over house and in car. Battery doesn't last as long as stated but several uses for sure. Great item,human
"This ice bag is both functional & cute.  I got one for myself, plus one for a girlfriend, who loved it!  The size is a little smaller than I expected, judging from the picture. But for a runner it's the perfect size to fit on a sore knee.",human
I HATE WASTING MONEY ON SUPPLEMENTS WONDERING IF THEY ARE DOING ANYTHING AT ALL.  WITH 17HD YOU CAN FEEL IT WORKING IN ABOUT  MINUTES.  IT IS AMAZING.  MY WORKOUTS ARE TRULY INTENSE AND IT IS HARD TO LEAVE THE GYM - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!,human
This wig has nappy roots. Its really poofy and the hair quality is very poor. It looked nothing like the picture. I would hope that my wig was just a defect and you receive a product that you're satisfied with. Not happy:(,human
I use it on my neck where I have some bone deterioration.  Wow it really feels good  and the relief from the discomfort in my neck lasts for at least a day and sometimes longer.  🥰,human
"Got the right stuff, on time in a right package.",human
"This is a great product if you do not have pets, or lint in your home. Not good for people with pets or lots of hairs laying around. It is a magnet that is hard to keep clean and fresh looking. Otherwise extremely comfortable and functional.",human
This is a product I've used for the last 8years. It's a very good product and was delivered right on time. Please continue this product. I would like to see the packages come in  ct and kind of case price for the amount of clothes in the future.Thank youShelly R.,human
"Aside from making you run to the bathroom all the time and your insides hurt, you gain weight instead of losing it.",human
These were ok. Served the purpose okay but not great.,human
"Product is super close to expiration date, not acceptable specially for a product that is for babies! Additionally seller did not even bother to answer my message! Don't buy anything from this seller!",human
Purchased for my two nephews! They are delighted with the fizzies at bath time.,human
Makes Mom feel special in the nursing home,human
Bought it for the girlfriend and she absolutely loved it. This is the bag we use when we go to bingo. We have had so many compliments.,human
"2nd unit we purchased. We run it   days. We change filter more often than they recommend. Complete filter kits are around $ plus shipping of $. Excellent filtration, very quiet. New unit has additional features.",human

"This is my 2nd Talley &amp; Twine watch. Great watch, I would give it  stars if it included the date. I work in a classified office and my cell phone can  not enter, I sometimes forget the date (getting old).  Great watch for the price. I added what I would call a classier leather band. The band that came with the watch was too long for me.",human
"Perfect I put one in my book bag, purse, car, etc ehrn. Need it it's there",human
Awesome for cleaning my sewing machine!,human
Great Scale,human
This product was exactly as described and performed perfectly in cleaning coins. Easy and safe to use and without a doubt the best I have seen in a long time. Will certainly buy again.,human
But it only have USB charging which is a downfall,human
The back brace works great if you need to do work around the house. It definitely gives you full support for your back. I like how you can adjust the shoulders to fit you properly and around the belly also. I wear mine over a light t-shirt and then put another shirt on top of it when going out of the house. Around the house I just put it on over my clothes and it works great either way.,human
This was perfect . Keeping it for all future eids,human
"Do not saw significant effect after whole bottle.For this price,do not recommend.",human
Very happy with this purchase. Dealer condition of item just as described. Hope to do business again.,human
I liked that they're transparent so I can see just how much water is in them. They don't leak and retain heat pretty well. Would buy again but they seem well made and I don't expect to have to.,human
it has thumb prints allover with strands of hair.,human
only  minutes run time...needed hours,human
Im glad I found this frames for my  year old son. It is cheaper from the optalmologist store!,human
"I purchased these glasses because I liked the style and the price seemed reasonable, and because it has become increasingly difficult to find non-prescription reader bifocals in stores like Walmart. My major beef with these glasses is that they regularly need to be tightened up--the little nuts holding them together keep loosening up, and I have to use a pair of needle-nosed pliers on them almost every day.",human
"the chain broke within the first  hours of wearing it :( :( the locket itself is cute and seems to be made well, its a shame",human
Wasn't as much in the bag for the price paid.,human
product wasn't  percent what I expected but sufficient,human
Not so rough. I want coarse,human
I am a teacher and bought these for my kid’s teachers after I received one of my own. I LOVE THIS! I use it more than I thought I would and it’s so nice to have all these emergency items on hand because there is no downtime in the classroom! Love it!,human
Seemed to really help my adrenal fatigue,human
Little pricey but t the worst thing is that it burned out in two weeks . I used it in my bandsaw .,human
Love it! The scent is perfect and the product truly performs better than expected.,human
"got it yesterday, I am so delighted with this product. I have kind of fine hair. After my hair was washed and dried. Within minutes as a first time user, My hair looked professionally done. Totally excellent, certainly worth the money. I am usually not handy with my kinky curly hair. And I dread washing as I will have to fix it again. (to look presentable) I would give this a  star if I could",human
Perfect size. Leaves residue on hands after handling.,human
The inserts don’t cover the entire sole of the shoe so the middle of my feet feel like they’re on hard jelly with nothing padding the rest of my foot.,human
These worked very well for my nighttime comfort.  They don't fall out like my previous pair and they are easy to put in and take out.,human
"The hair was ok, a bit larger than I needed. Puff sizes would've been great.",human
"Have only been taking it for a few days, so no real results as yet, but am willing to give more after a few weeks.  My only complaint is that there is only an half a bottle of pills in these larger bottles.. why?  I combined the two bottles into one, but such a waste of packaging really pisses me off.. there's just no reason for that.",human
"These stickers smell, for a few moments.  Alas, with the end of the ""matte"" scratch and sniff sticker, the era of a long-lasting smelling sticker has ended.  These stickers do contain a scent but the scents, so ethereal, last but a few fleeting moments, and not unlike the thunder (once you comment about it, it has already ended) these stickers lose their scents quickly.Shipping was a little high, as well.:",human
I have no idea how to use this. There’s no power button on the curler or any indicator on where to turn it on. The box it came in was a little smashed but the rest of the things are okay.,human
This glasses are for women only and they are pretty small.,human
This body wash smells wonderful. The foam makes it feel luxurious too.,human
"The Corner Smart Bath Basket is wonderful.  I found it extremely easy to install, and there is no sticky residue to deal with.When I first tried to install it, I couldn't get it to stay put, so I resorted to reading the directions.  You MUST clean your shower with soap (I used Palmolive Dishwashing Liquid), then rinsed and dried the area.  After that, there was absolutely no problem.  The basket has been in place with shampoo on it for  weeks now without any problems.  I would recommend this product to anyone.",human
Like this scent slot.,human
Cute and well made.,human
Love it!,human
Don’t fall for the false advertising,human

"Great gag gift, sure to upset all the other siblings.",human
This does the job!,human
"I have seen these at people’s houses and got mixed reviews. Not this brand just this product and I have seen them all over the Internet for sale. WouldHave killed for one of these in my teenage years but I will be honest, I didn’t expect itTo really work. I mean the concept seemed sound but what I thought to be common sense would tell you if it could pull a blackhead from under your skin it would pull to hard to not damageYour skin. Well common sense somehow got put to the side on this one bc I will tell you and everyone Including my mom if she asked this thing is fully legit. Luckily my skin these days isn’t just screaming with issues but for the first time in my life I was over the moon when i saw I had a blackhead. I pulled this sucker out and centered it over the spot and turned it on. I prob should have stayed on low but I clicked on the highest and I didn’t think it did anything significant. Felt the tug on my skin but clicked it right back off and looked at the little pad and saw this stuff in there and looked at my face. There was a ring that went away after like a minute and that sucker was all the way gone. It was amazing. I will vouch for this thing all day. Never bought anything that worked this good so fast. Amazing",human
Cheap quality. Plastic “toy.” Not worth it. I’ve been using it exactly as directed twice a day since I purchased it and have seen zero results.I don’t recommend it.,human
"These are likely expired? Product description states: ""Per GMP guidelines set forth by the FDA, most products are formulated for  months from the date of manufacture. Liquids and probiotics are formulated for  months.""What I received has a manufactured date of September 2016. Today is November 14th, 2018. These were ordered directly from Swanson.",human
My son liked it and it helps safety habits while promoting first aid. Enough room to add more stuff.,human
it’s narrower than expected. served my purpose well though.,human
Didn't notice any significant changes in my appetite.,human
"Misleading! Natural Armor essential oils do not have organic certification. Simply saying they are organic does not make it so. The company response to my query was, ""if you don’t feel comfortable with our company or our products, simply do not purchase them."" Buyer beware, if you truly want organic.",human
"I carry one in my backpack, and clean between my teeth after meals. It is so much gentler than using a toothpick and even gentler than using dental floss. I love the taste of the product--it refreshes your mouth after a meal. The fact that they help maintain tooth whitening is a huge bonus as well, especially because of how the brush gently squeezes between your teeth.",human
"I have really been enjoying these. Mine came very moist - Maybe even too moist in one of the tubes, and the toothpicks were very weak at first. After you open a tube the first time, they stay moist but dry enough to harden a bit, though they still won't be the most durable.The green flavor is a very different sweet spearmint, but I ended up really growing fond of it. Nice for when you don't want a full on energy drink but need a little pick me up.",human
"This stone has a fair clarity(not great), but an amazing energy.  This is one of the most energetic and uplifting stones I have encountered.  If you are a crystalworker, I recommend this wholeheartedly.This stone also pairs wonderfully with angelite.",human
Convenient and easy to use,human
These toothpicks are the shape and size I wanted and they are sturdy.,human
Really good shakey heads work well,human
"These insoles are comfortable but too narrow for my shoe which is size  D. The width of the insole is ."" at the widest part. That leaves a total gap of about half an inch between the insole and the sides of the shoe.",human
It helps my knees,human
"They do the trick, don’t get me wrong. However, I notice some differences in these compared to the original one that came with the pari nebulizer. First, they are misshapen and kind of flat. I figured over time and use, they would get their round shape back but they haven’t. Also, my daughter started to develop a little rash on both sides of her face just outside of her mouth, exactly where the plastic touches.  That never happened with months of use with the original.",human
"Three Stars for giving a replacement and wearing fairly comfortable, but I like my new Dockers better!Rarely have I any difficulty with sellers that go through Amazon, I guess it does happen. This time I received defectiivedamaged items. JiMarti guarantees a no questions asked, prompt replacement. Unfortunately, this was NOT the case. Trying to repeatedly send emails with delayed response. Finally, I got the replacement. Quite honestly, these Sunglasses ""are nothing to write home to mamma about."" as the saying goes. All in all, I am fairly satisfied and they wear comfortably numb. I wish they would have provided a self return paid label, gladly return the first ones. Even though they DO have a nice selection, I would not rely on this seller for sunglasses again. No Questions Asked Defective Item Policy hmm... Oh yeah we get lemons @x. funky merchant emails to boot ~~~~~~ maybe we all are having a blonde hair day LOL.P.S. I wound up buying Dockers Sunglasses at a little higher price with another merchant with prompt delivery, I am happy. :)",human
"Works well. But way too expensive. These are not expensive ingredients (ginkgo, PEA HCl, and caffeine). Was willing to pay $ per pill, even though that’s still a lot for these ingredients. At over $ per pill??  No thanks.",human
"Arrived with  of the prongs already having fallen out. The ones that remained in the device scratched my skin, they were not sanded properly and were not smooth. Don’t buy this item, buy higher quality.",human
"The brush heads are too soft. It is not meant for adults but for little kidstoddlers.Not worth the money, so i returned mine.",human
Very legit,human
I'm allergic to NSAIDS so I used this product for its Anti-Flamitory and wound care after my dog bit me and it worked great!  It also smells good which in my book is a plus.  There are so many essential oils out there that smell bad and that actually give me migraines because they smell so bad.  But this one doesn't do that so it's nice to come across ones that actually smell good.  I looked it up and discovered that Rosewood does other great things like helps with depression and boosts the immune system.  It can help the skin if you have sensitive or dry or oily skin.  It can also help as a nasal decongestant.  It works as a insect repellent which is great cause I don't like bugs!!! And it can be used as a perfume.  So its another essiential oil that has multiple purposes.  I highly recommend this product!,human
"Purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder.  It IS less messy than regular powder, however, it doesn't work as well.  And it is oddly... greasy?  He reports that it is lotiony in a weird way.  Since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry.  If it's lotiony or greasy, not so much.If you're hoping for a replacement for powder - this isn't it - at least in my husband's opinion.",human

"As soon as I attempted to insert a lock cylinder into the top hole and tighten down with the thumbscrews, the unusual alignment of the thumbscrews(weren't pointed directly at the side of the cylinder) kept causing the lock to twist and the thumbscrews kept slipping off the bottom of the lock. The plastic ring that reduces the hole size then cracked. I didn't even tighten the screws that tight. I ended up using a piece of leather as a shim to hold the lock cylinder in place. This is a kwickset lock cylinder and is the most common size. Too much work to set a cylinder.",human
"I ve tried other brands, this one does good brushing and clean my teeth. One tablet is a little too spare, two are perfect. Wish the peppermint is stronger though. Easy to use, and appreciated its friendly packaging.",human

Good enough for kids to play!!,human
This product supports my digestion very well.,human
"Update at bottom.......I like that it heats up fast, the size covers my entire back and heeling properties from the hot stones. It's much better than any regular heating pad. The plug could be in a better position other than that I love it. UPDATED 21222 Loved it until I plugged it in yesterday morning and it didn't heat up and it worked fine the day before. I broke my neck and back I use a heating pad most mornings to loosen my muscles and joints so I can move. It didn't get used everyday mainly since it got cold. Only had it for almost  months disappointed I have to spend more money on another heating pad and most likely won't get my money back for this. NOT HAPPY",human

Delicious and healthy,human

"I really like this pillbox.  It's large enough to fit many pills in each slot.  It stays closed.  Clock didn't work at first, however a coke got spilled on it and suddenly the clock started working.  Ha ha.... The pills remained dry.  I definitely would buy this again.",human
This was the first product that I purchased from this brand and I always have it in my house. Melatonin is not my jam but this supplement totally is. Not only does it taste like graham crackers and childhood Christmas but it actually works. My joints definitely let me know how unhappy they are in the morning if I didn’t have this the night before. I don’t go to sleep without it. Buy it!,human
To curl my lashes,human
Promptly sent and received.  It was exactly as described.,human
"This smells wonderful, but the scent does not last.  the wax only lasted for the day and the laundry detergent smelled great but didn't last.  You can tell this is a knockoff of the original.  I'm not bashing it, but you get what you pay for :)",human
"as far as removing old steps - this thing sucks..  unless you are only going to use this on NEW steps, get something else..  the opening in the socket is too small. any older steps with rust, and bends on them, will constantly get jammed inside this bit. unless you want a future filled with hammering steps out of this socket, move on.  i suggest trying the pole step driver from Reliable instead. and i am a huge, HUGE - Milwaukee fan..  this driver bit needs a redesign.  Sorry Milwaukee, but its the truth.As far as this new lime green model goes, we stumbled onto one of our newer guys called Go-Go mounting it into a hammer drill instead of the impact.  He swears the in and out motion works a lot better than just spinning in the seated position.",human

Nice and stretchy. Good amount of adhesive.,human
"This is my second time buying irish sea moss. The first go round was a definite bust not even knowing about it, it had a terrible chemical smell, it was moist and rubbery, plus the color was very pale. THIS IRISH MOSS HOWEVER; upon opening a very pleasant smell, the bag is stuffed, and it's not covered in unnatural salt. I soaked a pinch of  it for only  minutes and it expanded so big I had to add more water. Haven't blended it yet but I'm confident that it will hell perfectly. I recommend this. Thank you.",human
Sucked. Quality heat.  All of it,human
good quality very thick,human
"I've been using Bonapel for  months and am very happy with results. My tummy looks firmer and those baggy arms looking toned. I love the dimples on my face, however, the ones on my butt..had to go.

"The picture is a little prettier, but this is a very nice sized and uniquely shaped stone.

"these are U.S. - ..  they work the same, but they are not as soft as the originals + it keeps them from bunching up in heels, - they aren't as comfortable, they feel like a recycled plastic cloth product.. I'm thinking of putting thin liner socks over them .. but it's great having a thin option again!! .. even if I had to order it from the UK .. they arrived quickly though so don't worry about the long date they give. I got mine within a week",human

"The scrubber is great quality and easy to use. I am a rather small flexible human who doesn't have any issues situating the scrubber in order to scrub my back, however I'm sure those with low flexibility or a large backshoulders could still have some issues. The scrubber did come out of the package with a very strong perfume smell, thats rather nauseating, however it does fade considerably over a few washes.",human
"Wow, I love this reading glasses. It's the best reading glasses I've ever bought. It fits perfect like I was measured, light weight and I don't even feel it in my face. It also holds up in place when moving my head. I'm going to buy more other colors too.",human
Not as pliable as I expected,human
Nice but love the lemon scent better,human
Dislike the fact that first time using the handle broke off,human

"Not good for shorter hair. Curling iron says to hold the heating mechanism away from face but then it doesn't curl your hair at all, and when you hold the heat towards your face it works better, but still doesn't make a full curl. For how much I spent on this I would expect it to have better results.",human
Love it!,human
Great product but if you shop around you can get comparable products for less money.,human
"OMG!! This thing is amazing and I love it,works great !!!🙂🙂😍😍",human
"I was very impressed with this product as I have never used anything Like this before. The balls were comfortable, packaged discreetly and very easy to clean. I think its best with you start with the smallest and work your way up to the biggest one. I liked how comfortable they were as well. Totally Recommended!",human
I have bought these before.  They fit just like the other ones did.  They stay on tight and does not loose up.  Great product and great service.,human
"Stopped working JUST after the return window expired. Very disappointed!EDIT: Seller contacted me after original review was left and offered a replacement or refund. I opted for a replacement item, and I’m glad I did- I’ve had the replacement for several months and it’s working very well. Thank you! Great customer service from the seller!!!",human
Great bags and good size. Bought them for a craft market,human
Too short and the scrubbers on the side don't hold soap.  Needs to be at least a foot longer to make it easier to use.  Not worth the money back brush works easier.  Don't waste your money on these.,human
Came fast and works fine with my facial cleaner I bought from Walmart,human
"Gorgeous scent, Lasts through the day.",human
Great pump! So easy to use and has very strong suction features and modes. Love the fact that it’s made differently than other wearable pumps and it doesn’t make your boob look weird. It’s very natural looking. So far I haven’t found anything I disliked. I will definitely be adding this to my pumping routine,human
My wife had a severe burn from boiling liquid. This product was absolutely outstanding in protecting the area. It's now healed.,human

"The RV repair place where we had a new floor installed left a can of this in our RV.  They said it would remove any kind of stain from anything.  They are right!  I use this product on grease stains on my husband's clothes and to clean up the grease spots on my black kitchen appliances. It doesn't have a really heavy petroleum smell like bug & tar remover that I have used for these jobs before.  I haven't used it on my carpet yet but I'm sure I will. $ is plenty to pay, for sure, but a little of this goes a long way.",human
This really works to squeeze out the last drop of any tube. I use primarily with tubes of paint and only flaw is that sometimes the tube will split. I wish you could adjust the level of squeeze a bit.,human
Easy to use. I have developed warm feelingsfor this product.,human
"I just received this item and I hadn't even tried it on, but I could tell from the feel of it I made an excellent choice. If you need a head strap for plastic frames that slide down your nose (as mine always do), get this product! It is even better than I had hoped: the strap is very lightweight, you won't even know you have it on. I wear behind-the-ear hearing aids -- the pieces that attach to my frames are very thin and pliable and fit nicely in my crowded ear space! The part that goes behind your head has a velcro fastener with the very cool company name on it. The strap sits low on my neck and is hardly noticeable, even with a shaved head. This strap is well worth your money and will do the job perfectly! The only available color is black -- I would have preferred some other -- but because of how well it works, I can easily overlook the matter. Order today!",human
cheap price but not good. It doesn't hold the syringe securely. The MediCool ones which are priced high work much better. You get what you pay for.,human
Great! Came with zip up case and soft case + lens cloth!,human
toothbrush heads are super.,human
I love it they are perfect fit and as described are helpful,human
"I’m considering Palram roof panels for a shed I’m planning to build, but thought I’d give them a trial run on a dog house first. With a simple gabled roof, the ridge was the perfect finishing touch. They are pricey for what you’re getting (a ’ section when an ’ panel is half the price).",human
"How much do I LOVE this flat iron? So much that I bought a second one for my daughter less than a week after I purchased one for me! This flat iron heats up so fast (after the first use, I only heat to , it was that hot!) and the brush style bristles get hot, too, for an almost single pass through to achieve results. It gave us straight yet bouncy, sleek hair. My daughter and I have super thick, wavy hair and the heated teeth get every side of the hair was we pull through, every time. Be sure your hair is brushed prior to using as the teeth will snag a knot. I wish it had protective steam (like my last one) but with a lower temp, it hasn't damaged my hair yet. Love this and HIGHLY recommend!",human
Cool. No smell but you can use it as a car accessory,human
Awful way too small. I have a very large member but this feels awful and is very small. Not worth it .,human

"Bought this for my  year old mother who was using a traditional four leg walker. She was getting slower and stiffer. Now with the Winnie Go-Lite, she can move more freely and easily navigate anywhere. The breaking system is secure and she can operate it even with very arthritic hands.",human
"You can do much much better for this price.  However, I can get a decent shave from it if I need.  Workmanship is cheeeap, there are flaws and uneven surfaces.  It is on the aggressive side but it gets the job done.  It will test your skills.  I can't say I recommend it.",human
Fun design that went with out tie dye theme but the bags were really thin and they ripped easily.,human
Made my work day pain free and nighttime leg cramps almost disappear!,human
"This works great. Purchased for my autistic son.His grandpa made a platform for it based on the one found on www.autismfrog.com under the dyi bubble column platform link. I was able to purchase the wood for it in the value wood section at menards. Ours came with the colored balls, not the fish (we are happy with it regardless). There were no directions, but you just fill it with water to the max line, add the balls or fish, plug it in, and switch it at the bottom of the base. We plan to eventually add the non-breakable mirrors as shown on autismfrog.com as well.",human

"[[VIDEOID:8029a0208501abe359ec1ebab525d10b]] i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone in any way of my opinion of this product.This exfoliating hand and back loofah has a soft terry cloth material, they are not too harsh. This back scrubber is about  inches shorter than the one I just got and about   inch less in width. The rope handle on this one is also thinner than one I just got, But these still do the job.I love fact that I can reach my back without hurting myself. Both of my rotary cuffs are ripped, so these really come in handy. These are great for both men, women and children. My grand daughter is 8yo and she likes to use them. These help take off the dead skin for better, cleaner skin. Taking off the dead skin also helps so you don't break out.Another great idea to use the back scrubber: Lotion. Can never get that middle part of your back? Just dad a little lotion in the middle and use the back scrubber to apply the lotion. I do this all the time.",human
"There is nothing like a new clipper blade! Been grooming dogs for years, and I found this blade set worked great for me. Much better price than the brand name but works just as well. These are nicely packed. Super fast shipping! Fits my Andis and A5 Oysters clipper perfectly. Fits all my # guard combs perfectly. These are very sharp professional-grade blades. The blade cut smooths and even, without leaving any cut lines. I prefer this type of metal blade as it can be sharpened. Overall, they work great and would recommend them!",human

"I received my bracelet a couple of days ago and am pleased with it. It fits well, is obviously a medical ID bracelet that all medical personnel will instantly recognize, and the built-in software is basic, but serviceable.Downsides: If you are a large person with a bigger than normal wrist, this bracelet might be too small for you. I am a -pound male and it fits me perfectly. However, I know some people with bigger wrists who might have problems.The included software is a bit basic but seems to do the job. It has no built-in printing capability but I found it is easy to print: take a screenshot and print that. That takes a second or two and it works well. I'd prefer built-in printing, but this work around is simple and suffices. I suspect that all medical personnel and most everyone else can figure it out in a second or two. Then again, there isn't all THAT much information. I'm not sure anyone will really need to print it.I also copied a text file to the jump drive called EMERGENCY - READ ME.TXT that duplicates most of the information I entered into the bracelet's ID and then I added quite a bit more info besides. I gave the names and phone numbers of several next of kin, in case the two listed in the bracelet's software were both unavailable. I also added information about my medical insurance, car insurance (I am guessing this could be useful after an auto accident) and everything else I could think of. The EMERGENCY - READ ME.TXT file is easily printed.I am keeping the bracelet and plan to wear it all the time.",human
"This thing is amazing! It feels better on your scalp than you can put into words. I have a really dry but simultaneously insanely oily scalp. The result is that my scalp is always crazy itchy while my hair gets super oily really quickly. It's a nightmare. Since using this and other brushes like these, the itchiness has calmed down significantly and I'm able to spread my natural oils through my hair more evenly to prolong the time between washes. This is also amazing for deep conditionershair masks because it just really works the product in and moisturizes the scalp.I have tried several brushes like these but this one is by far my favorite because it is silicone all the way through vs plastic handle which just makes it easier and more comfortable to maneuver. Also because the tips provide a deeper, more comfortable massage than the brushes with solid tips.I love that you can use it on wet or dry hair. This is honestly such a great product that I wish I had been using for years past!",human
This product is amazing for cleaning the boat. It gets off any pesky spots and makes getting those tough spots clean a breeze. We will never use anything else.,human

"Amazon won't let me cuss in my review. But trust me I would love to cuss up a storm.I wish I could call the Better Business Buerau of China and make someone improve this product. Brand new arrays stop working RIDICULOUSLY quick. Some didn't work AT ALL. I have one left and feel like I might as well throw it away, as well. These are supposed to work AT LEAST  hours if you keep the machine at . amps (max). Good luck getting through  hour with it functioning. My 9th one stopped working after  minutes.  I think MAYBE two of them worked as much as  hours.VERY MUCH a waste of money. WHERE ARE THE GOOD ARRAYS?!?!?!?!?!! PLEASE SOMEONE tell me where to buy a functional product. I LOVE my ionic detox machine. I HATE how hard it is to find quality arrays. Zinger Electronics, I just left a  star review for the arm straps you sold me because they were the first to actually fit the socket. But now I'm wondering if that might be defective too.I Was REALLY looking forward to getting my complete detox on this February.

"They're simple, they work and they're reasonably small. They work on all masks that don't have ear loops that are super thick and they are even reusable if you're pairing them with disposable masks.",human
Smells very good & colors work in my bathroom.,human
"It's easily adjustable and easy to attach to mask's ear loops.  However, it'll keep sliding down from my head toward my neck.  Placing the mask loop above my ear helps but then it also puts some pressure to my ear.  Overall, it is better than wearing mask directly on my ears but doesn't work as well as I expected.",human

"If any wand developer has discovered nothing more than a way to detect and measure zero point energy it would be a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment. The ability to harness and control zero point energy, let alone all the profound benefits attributed to it, would be tantamount to harnessing and controlling gravity. It would be the single greatest scientific breakthrough in human history. And there would be at least one double-blinded, clinical study to validate it.According to Amega and other wand producers, ZPE somehow promotes cellular repair by ""reminding"" our cells to ""return to source"". That is, their original, undamaged, pristine state. This begs the question, why does Zero Point Energy only contribute to repairing cells we can't see? Why doesn't zero point energy repair skin cells of burn victims or those with eczema, psoriasis or acne? Why doesn't it reverse cataracts, or return the scalp cells of balding men back to ""source""? In fact, the only demonstrations we are ever presented are subjective, where the subject rates their pain from  to , and the injury is internal where we must only assume ""cellular repair"" actually took place. This is somewhat similar to charlatans like Peter Popoff and Benny Hinn who routinely heal trick hips and bad backs, but who can never seem to find any clinically blind, quadriplegic or stage- cancer patients in their audience, in spite of the hundreds that attended.Instead of demonstrating the miraculous powers of these wands on citrus fruits, old dogs or people with a headache, as you will find all over YouTube, why don't they send free wands to stage four cancer sufferers who are under hospice care and have ceased all anti-cancer treatment? That way there would be no doubt what caused their cancer to go into remission, they could save thousands of lives and end tremendous suffering, and these wand purveyors would heroically be front page news all over the world. And there would be a multi-billion dollar bidding war among pharmaceutical companies for the rights to this technology, and hundreds of new jobs created to dig the ten mile deep hole for them to bury it in.For the record, I have performed extensive research into ZPE wands, specifically Amega Global's AMWand, including blind field testing.

And it tastes great and easy to swallow, absorbs better than any other brand, is a good value compared with other options.And I have to say this vitamin b12 is liquid form that easily absorbed than pills or tablets and has a advanced technology of liposomal formula, that's something that other b12 doesn't have. This form could help to carry the vitamin B12 deliver deep into body for better absorption.I am really happy I found this one. I would recommend to anyone if you are in the market for B12.",human
I really like that I can add flavor to my daily water intake and get my collagen in at the same time. This has good ingredients and the flavor is pretty good.

Love these earmuffs. Sound quality is decent and I like that you can remove the cord if you want. Can't beat the price. I considered the UGGS headphone earmuffs but they were way more expensive and they weren't behind the ears. These fit fine.

"The three stars is not for the pool itself, which is pretty awesome, but since the company that sells it, Plumstruck, deserves zero stars, I compromised and used three.  Other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue, but since the description specifically mentions a ladder, I thought the problem was fixed. When Amazon and I both contacted Plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool, Plumstruck repeated ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included.  Since the pool is useless, even dangerous without the ladder, this issue must be addressed by the ad.  That being said, Amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price so if the company would just change their wording, people could figure all of this out in advance.  Amazon is investigating the company, so hopefully all of this will change.Some people mentioned a heater, but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description. I was actually worried it would only work with the heater and I didn't want to have to use a  outlet, so I was relieved that it doesn't have one. If I decide I need a heater later, I will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation. I will never order anything through Plumstuck again. They are a  horrible company. If you can find this pool through someone else, I recommend it. It is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage, but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workout.I also want to add that Amazon sells a salt water conversion system that my local pool store also sells (for a lot more money) that the pool representative says will work with this pool so I will soon be able to convert it to salt water.",human

"These are billed as 'medium' toothbrushes, they are super soft, like little kid toothbrushes.  I don't even feel like they are cleaning my teeth.  No bristle shedding observed (tried two of the pack so far).  The head and handle are a little rough, but I didn't not experience any splinters.  But if your mouth is so sensitive you need this level of softness in a bristle, the wood might be too much for you.",human
"I never thought I'd order a broom online....but years ago I bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom I had ever used. I have never found another since then that even comes close...I even replaced the old handle when it broke so I could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones I could find locally. So, I came online to see if I could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after YEARS of hard use...and low and behold...Amazon had one. I paid significantly more for this one than I did my original one and it's worth every penny. This one is bigger...I originally had the &#;. The reason I like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it. I'd re-purchase this several times over, happily. It has made me a broom snob, lol :)",human

These diapers if you get the bundle packs off of honest.com will cost you as much as the organuc diapers bought off the shelf. The difference is that these diapers hold sooo well. My son was breastfed the first  months and breastfed babies poo alot and its always runny. Never had a leak. Organic diapers aling with organic wipes n cremes have been the only thing that has helped my son and his super sensitive skin. I highly reccommend the whole honest baby line.,human

"This stuff is the absolute bees knees! I only couldn't give it  stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted so about  of it was already spilled out, so I had to clean it off and was left with what was still inside. The product itself..worked amazingly! My hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job. And even with gloves on the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands. This is the first thing I use as soon as I get home from a long day. The scrubber it comes with is stiff bristled so it holds up well. A little product on the nail scrubber, and its easily cleans all the grease and dirt right off. The product itself is a 1010, but they need to work on the packaging and getting it sent out in something more secure. I know delivery drivers smash up the boxes and so the original manufacturer can't be to blame. But if it were my product, I would put more filling or bubbles wrap the product to keep this from happening. I had a friend that had the exact same issue with this product arriving damaged. Solid product all in all.",human

"After reading many frustrated customer reviews, and having two separate personal experiences with what appears to be the current state of affairs with modern digital bathroom scales (for the majority of scales, you simple cannot get consistent repeat readings) this scale is the exception and just great.For some reason it seems to be really hard to design a digital scale that reads the same when you make multiple weighings one right after another. Whether the scale is too sensitive to subtle changes in the positioning of the feet, or it's some other factor entirely, I've found it's common to get over half a pound difference between repeat weighings.But not with this scale! The reading changes at most 0. lbs, and usually is exactly the same! Hallelujah.",human

I was surprised to find that not many brands offer a latex insole, and many advertise themselves as ""latex free"".  Too bad, because I find latex to be a very supportive and buoyant material and I went for a short walk with these insoles in my rykas yesterday and they were very comfortable.  The only downside is that there is not a good selection of sizes and I am a size  in shoe.  So my toes on my bigger foot could feel the bottom lining of my shoe, but the rest of my feet were comfortable on this insole.  I will definitely buy another pair, however.",human

"I hate the old fashioned squeezy lash curlers and had given up having curled lashes. When I saw that there were curling irons for lashes I was excited but was unwilling to shell out a lot of cash for something that might not work. This curler was really inexpensive and had no reviews, but it looked exactly like one that cost  times as much, so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm glad I did because it really works and has most of the features that the more expensive ones have - this is a win!Here's the rundown of what I like: It's rechargeable, so no batteries! it charges quickly and one charge lasts a couple of weeks. It has  heat settings. I've tried them all and even the lowest works well. It's easy to clean and has a cover to keep it protected when it's not in use. I do want to mention that the instructions advise you to put a coat of mascara on before you use the curler, and then to use another coat when you're finished curling. All of the curlers I looked at said this, but I've started just curling my lashes before putting any mascara on and it works just as well. Maybe better, because sometimes my mascara would clump when I did it the other way. It might just be me, but I like it better.This is a great curler at a great price - definitely worth it!.",human

First off, it had a weird strong scent, not a subtle neroli scent like the one I'm accustomed to. I sprayed some on my face anyway, and within seconds my face was itching like nobody's business.

"OK look - its advertised as a flame less candle. So, thus,  I foolishly expected it to look a LITTLE bit like a CANDLE.Much like other reviewers have stated, the biggest issue I have with this is the electric plug. I cant even create the illusion of a candle with that thing attached.The look is bad, the cord is a bad idea, and it in no way resembles a candle so much as a badly lit lamp of some sort.At least the smell is good, when you stand really close to it.Do NOT buy this if you value your money. Check out the other - ANY other version by any other company that does not have a cord attached. At least then you can pretend its a candle instead of some lame lamp that doesn't even light the area around itself enough to find the on and off switch.",human

"This is definitely not a high-quality set. However, it does give you an idea on how to set up and use a gun and use the practice skin. This comes with everything you need to learn how to start tattooing, including two guns, needles, bottle for sanitizing soap (soap not included), practice skin, power box, rubber bands, ink and more.This comes with no instructions on how to work these guns, so you have to Google how to set this up and how to work it. Which is not good if you have no idea what you're doing. I almost want to take this kit down to my local tattoo shop and ask them how to set this up just in case I've been doing it wrong, because honestly, I have zero clue. I figured out the general idea, but that was about it.Out of the two guns, one arrived broken and will not turn on when hooked up. The other one stops working randomly, and I did double check and make sure that the cables were inserted fully. The guns themselves feel pretty cheaply made but look kinda cool. I do like the &#;hardy&#; look they have going on.I haven't used this on actual skin yet, as I'm definitely not an expert, and really never touched a tattoo gun until now...but the ink didn't have great results on the practice skin, so I don't think I would even attempt it on real skin, even with practiceOverall, I think this would be an okay starter kit if you're just wanting to learn how to set up a tattoo gun, and maybe tattoo the practice skins, or some fruit...but you'll definitely want an upgrade if you want to tattoo skin. Also, keep your fingers crossed that the guns arrive in working condition.I received this item at a discount  in exchange for my honest  review. This had no effect on my opinion of this product, and i would have said the same thing if I had paid full price.",human
product was as described,human
"First the mat did not have a plastic cover over it, just mailed in a thin box, but no damage.  This is made in China if you want to know where.  It looks made well and strong. The brittles are firm but not going to hurt. But the suctions only half hold up. Probably good for feet not the back.",human
"Great for my toddler's eczema, very moisturizing and seems to soothe his flare ups. Works better than aveeno! Love it!",human
Great,human
The size and appearance are just as pictured. Suction works well. Stays on hands free and you have to really work to accidentally dislodge it.

"The five star rating is because they are so cute and a fun item to use on letters, packages, and the like.  I love to display my favorite animal on my cosrrrespondence to family and friends.  (Business correspondence - well, no.)  I'm an adult that has loved the panda since childhood and still collect figurines,  pictures, etc.  This tape is useable in any length of  tape or individuallly by cutting what is wanted.  Makes me smile when I see and use the tape. I definitely would recommend this prduct to anyone who loves pandas or just animals for a fun item to use.  I like the tape period.",human
My son’s feet hurt when wearing his baseball cleats .  After calling his pediatrician they suggested buying a pair of arch supports for plantar fasciitis.  I purchased these and they worked out for him.  No more pain.,human
This set has the perfect summer colors! I absolutely love and am a big fan of the glitter polished. Super halo and dimensional. Had a nice reflective. Others colors are bright and pigment. With one coat you’d be good to go!,human
"I looked for several weeks for this item in all the Grocery stores that I normally shop at. I live  miles from the nearest Walmart, so I was getting desperate for a replacement for the one that I did have. I had to keep sticking it back on whenever I tried to was something, and it was getting to be a real pain. I like and would recommend this item to make your cleaning easier.",human
I love this and will continue to order it.  I am new to this but so far so good!  Good !,human
"Given the opportunity to do it again, I would not have gotten the white cast iron enamel Kohler sink I always wanted, but too late. We got it and cleaning it is a pain in the neck. You need this special cleaner (though there are other brands of it) but you can't just use dish soap. This dissolves stains and metal pot marks. You cannot just wash the sink and you can scrub it. This is overpriced for what it is, and it is a downright shame you can't clean the sink traditionally with dish soap, sponge and water.",human
A great addition for usage in reusable face masks. I feel more protected and safe knowing I have these filters installed in my mask.,human

"update, now it won't even turn on. ugh....  Gave it a two because atleast it works when you put the battery in and turn it on. Most of the current is in your hand, not where you put the end of the pen. I put it all over my husbands neck and nothing, but I felt it in my hand and when he tried he felt it in his hand.  Cindy :(",human
"Came much later then expected, but it arrived.It's not very waterproof or smudge-proof, but its a pretty decent eyeliner for the price.",human

"I love this little fish. The purpose of the purchase was to have one place to put my glasses as I take them off to work at the computer, then &#;hunt&#; them down go elsewhere, to find them hidden somewhere, i.e. under papers, to the right... to the left etc; so this serves a great purpose. I am not an artist, but the paint quality seems good, the paint is thick and covers the fish well with no streaks and it is covered well, the ad's colors are accurate and perfect for me. Glossy but not overly, shiny. The colors are as depicted in the ad (see attached pics). The notch for the eyeglass frames is about &#; (0. mm) at the bottom and &#; ( mm), see pic with ruler, thus the fish can accommodate a wide variety of frame thicknesses. My frames a very thin and while the fish works well it does take a bit of placement to balance the eyeglasses more of an awareness than extra work. The fish also seems more stable with hisher nose to the desktabletop. I would guess this as well with thicker-heavier frames. I removed the bar code sticker between the fin-arms and there was a hole, I don't know if it could go on a stand of some sort, ceramic dust also came out of the hole, revealing that the fish is mad of ceramic and not wood or plastic. All in all very pleased with artisanship and functionality.",human

"While the color shown in the Amazon listing is what I was looking for, the vacuum-packed bag of chips that arrived appear &#;pulverized&#;. The item description is for -inch chips, but I'd say that perhaps % of them are that big, and certainly none bigger. The rest are - or -inch and even smaller ... down to &#;tan dust&#;. I'm not going to ruin the hard work on my epoxy floor with this.",human

"Here's a great ally in the battle against noise. Simple, yet very effective, earplugs. You can't go wrong with those. I've been using them along with my 3M Peltor earmuffs (full reviews of these on my Amazon profile) and the result is superb. When it comes to sleeping, there's no better friend. And because they come in a pack of  - yep, two cans full of earplugs! - you can rest assured they are going to stick around for a while.Great product indeed.",human

"PROS:Nice looking.Solidly built.CONS:Painful and unpleasant leg massage. It doesn't massage the feet with rollers like some other chairs, it only has a painful squeezing action using air bags. Even on the lowest setting, it was extremely painful.Feels ""low end"" in terms of features compared to other massage chairs in the 2k-3k price range.No memory feature - you have to recalibrate the massage heads for height and width each time you use it. It defaults to the original settings each time it turns off. Whenever you select a new massage setting, for a few moments you get a very uncomfortable massage while you have to wait to slowly move the massage heads to a comfortable position using the keypad.Shoulder and neck massage doesn't work well. Couldn't find a comfortable shoulder and neck setting and it felt weak.Faux Leather. But I think most massage chairs are using faux leather now.",human
"This face steamer worked well.  Fill it with water, turn it on and wait for the steam.  The steam took about  or  minutes to heat but after that the steamer worked well.  Easy set up and easy to use.",human

Got the wrong item. We got the white cheddar crisps instead but felt like it wasn’t worth it to exchange.,human
I paid a lot of money for something that broke within  months it breaking. And not just a cracked. It broke in half at the hinge. It is horribly designed. And isn’t compact at all.

It comes with soft brush, regular  brush and a polishing sponge, and every time I use it I feel like it really makes a difference for my normally greasy oily skin . I have less dirty clogged pores now and my skin is shiny and soft . It definitely helps get rid of bacteria and old skin.It’s a nice durable product.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a facial cleanser brush .",human

"Like many women out there, I have a husband with a terrible snoring problem. His snoring is so loud, he often makes it difficult for me to fall asleep, or will wake me up in the middle of the night.  I bought this product after trying other nasal strips, nose inserts, and other items recommended by friends and family.My husband is a good sport and happily put the device on before we went to bed.  After a few minutes, he quickly fell asleep and I didn’t hear a peep out of him!  I was so relieved!I tried the device on myself just to see if it was comfortable and would be easy to wear. The thing I noticed was that although the device was extremely comfortable, it would slide around a little on my head. Not a deal breaker, but thought I would mention it anyway.If you have a snoring problem or have a spouse that does – you should really consider purchasing one of these snoring straps. It was definitely the thing that helps me get the sleep I needed.When I purchase an item, I rely heavily on the customer reviews to verify the seller's claim.

"Well, it did keep me from rolling onto my back, but I did not use it per the horrible directions.  Directions are minimal.  It has a picture showing strap to chest not waist, but doesn't say what the benefit of chest vs waist is.  The strap is awful!  It is rigid and bulky and feels like sleeping on rocks for the most part.  First,  I am a woman and strapping this across my breasts was not appealing or comfortable.  I tried just below and the strap hurt my ribs, so I went with the obvious choice and strapped it to my waist (as directions said not to do).  Worked fine strapped around waist.  I was unable to roll to my back.  I will be changing out the straps as they are uncomfortable.  I want straps that have some flex and are thinner.  I don't understand how this would facilitate good breathing strapped tightly around the chest.  This was the only product I could find to keep me from rolling over, so I am grateful it was available.  However, it could be more comfortable with better straps.  The directions are probably vague to avoid making claims so the FDA doesn't shut this down, but a bit about what the benefit of chest vs waist would have been nice especially as it is uncomfortable as directed.  It is also darn hard to inflate.",human

"The problem is the packaging is over-the-top. Guys, I don't want to pay for fancy packaging. Just put it in a bag, seal it, and be done with it. Pass the savings on to your customers. It's seriously wasteful to put this tiny amount of powder into a fancy bottle and bag. I know I'm paying too much when I see that. I know I'm not getting a good value when I see that. I think it's probably a good product. I don't notice any effects, but yet I trust it's doing something. It's probably foolish but I keep buying it because it's one of the only dual water AND Alcohol extracts. I will switch as soon as another alcohol extract comes on the market that's focused on value.",human
"I initially got the liquid version of chanca piedra, because I was in pain and needed fast relief and the pill estimated delivery was further out than the liquid. After I found the liquid version worked and I was getting low, I ordered the pill version. The pill version worked just as good as the liquid version and was a little easier, because it didnt require 3x's daily dosage and didnt require all the water (don't get me wrong you def need water with kidney stones, but its hard to work and function in life when you are constantly going to the bathroom). Anyhow, this stuff is great. I'm so grateful it is available and enabled me to take care of my stones on my own rather than giving my hard earned dollars to docs who btw never mention this product's existence.",human

"While YMMV, I found this unpleasant to use and very irritating to my sensitive teeth. I've tried others and had a similar problem but this was almost right out of the gate. The pen is harder to use than a tray or strips because it's hard to get into nooks and crannies but they generally do work. I just couldn't deal with the sensitivity. A hard no for me!",human
"I do believe this product works. I bought it years ago, and I can't remember what I paid for it or what site I went through, but I didn't have any issues with being overcharged, nor did I continue to be charged. One thing I have to point out though, is that I used Crest Whitestrips shortly before using Celebrity Sexy Teeth. I didn't notice any change in the shade of my teeth with the Crest Whitestrips, so I started using Celebrity Sexy Teeth as soon as I finished up the Crest Whitestrips. I noticed really fast results using the Celebrity Sexy Teeth. The name itself sounds like a scam, and thinking back, I'm surprised I ever gave it a chance, but I'm glad I did. Many people say it doesn't work for them, but maybe using two products (one right after another) had something to do with it for me. Not to bash Crest Whitestrips, but I didn't notice a single improvement after using them, until I used this stuff right afterward. Huge improvement.",human

This one tastes like a fake matcha (is the best way for me to describe it, but in a good way). I feel the difference in my knees within  days. (I am , had a baby at  and was really feeling it!). This made me feel more mobile and I could feel the flexibility in my joints. I hope to find it at a Ross or Home goods again, but if not, for me it's worth paying double.",human

For the first night in weeks, I slept like a baby,  pain-free for eight hours straight. I woke up feeling wonderful.

Initially when I read the packaging, I was a bit confused as in one sentence it says, &#;Cools Hot Flashes & Promotes Perimenopausal and Menopausal health&#; I'm not sure if the word &#;Promotes&#; is the right word to describe someone going through Menopause would want to hear.  I would think words like Prevent or  Help Slow the Process, are words that sound more comforting and reliable.  Every woman with hormones will inevitably have to go through this process and they want something that will work well, quick and help to ease the symptoms.  Hopefully I can see more of a difference after I finish the entire bottle.",human

I looked all over camper web sites to find replacement clips for our RV sliding doors and here they were.  These are made of strong plastic but over time can get brittle and under pressure snap.  That's what happened to us and we were very happy to find them here at Amazon.  Good product and they keep our sliding doors closed when traveling.,human
I bought these for my nieces & nephews to have fun with since I enjoyed them in the 's.  The kids love them!,human

Pink zebra has been the worst experience for me that I’ve ever had when ordering things online. Not only does the stuff I ordered smell like vinegar and cheap dollar store spray but trying to get it returned has been the worst experience and still NOBODY has sent me a return label or contacted me back. I’ve had to handle a trouble ticket as if it’s my job but the companies own supervisor Tanisha doesn’t care and makes you feel wrong for calling the Office to get things taken care of! It’s going on a WEEK and I still have nothing resolved!!!!! I might have to just dispute the charge with my bank and call it good and NEVER order from pink zebra ever again,human
Exactly what I was looking for,human

Great energy pills. Can help you get stuff done or can help you get rock hard. This pill hasn't had any side effects and has been used a few times. Amazing price especially since they really work. They are not only for when you want them sexually but also work to boost your stigma and energy levels.,human
These capsules are not as large as some of the other brands.  These work great for me because they fit in my pillbox with my other pills.,human

"Updated:At first I really liked these sleep masks. I had to make a small adjustment, but they seemed to work well so I gave them four stars. Well, now that I have used it for a while, the red sleep mask leaves black marks from the strap all over my sheets. The black dye will not wash all the way out, so I have ruined a nice set of sheets. I don't know if this is the case with all the masks from this company or just mine. So beware when you purchase.These sleep masks are pretty good, especially for the price. You get two masks, two sets of foam ear plugs (which I don't use), and a carrying case. I really like that these are contoured over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyelid. The only reason they didn't get five stars is the nosepiece. I found it to be a little too wide. I had to perform minor surgery and cut out a small v-shaped piece of material from the nosepiece in order to make the mask block out more light from the bottom and take pressure off the bridge of my nose. Now they work great, but I probably decreased the lifespan of the masks. But for the price, I don't think that will be problem Time will tell.",human
This product did nothing for my back pain. Would not recommend.,human
"Has everything I could ask for in a hydrating drink with BCAAs. Flavor tastes more like a beverage than a supplement which is a good thing. Using the whole scoop may be a bit too strong for alot of people even when using a full sized blender bottle. If you were looking for more of an OG gatorade type vibe for your intra-workouts, I would recommend using a little less (which will also make it last longer).",human

It's not thick, heavy, or ""grainy"" either, just the right consistency.  Very nice flavor without being overpowering or lingering too long!  I can easily suggest it for both men and women since it's not a shiny gloss!  It stays on for quite a while but if I do need to reapply I purchased the  pack (GREAT DEAL...only $.00 per tube), so...I can do that freely, at will and as the mood strikes me with all I have to use...ha ha ha!

"I purchased these thinking they'd be like similar showershampoo brushes I've used in the past.  They're not.  These have more teeth, so when brushing your hair, the teeth don't slip through your hair quite as easily.  And they are not 'soft' plastic.Also, when using in the shower, I often clip the curved 'T' handle to the shower head spout.  Unfortunately, these won't stay put.  They slip off after a few seconds.  (The curved 'T' handle was the reason I purchased this model in the first place.  Most of the other models listed on Amazon have either loop or grip handles that can't be clipped to the shower downspout.)Lastly, I've noticed on one of these that the teeth shrank and deformed, apparently after prolonged exposure to my preferred hair care product.  This was a first for me, since I've used similar brushes for years without this happening (with others, you just had to live with the teeth falling out over time).  Apparently, the manufacturer felt that testing (or at least researching) the effects of different solvents commonly used in hair care products on the plastic used in these brush's manufacture was an unnecessary expense.  And that's entirely okay.  I'll just post a less-than-enthusiastic review and never buy these again.You'd think that something like a showershampoo brush would be easy to get right.  Apparently not.  Not recommended.",human
Absolutely trash. Looked and felt nothing like the photo. I even had to do a double take to see if I got the right item and that’s what it said it was. I’m shocked. This is the worst Amazon purchase I’ve ever made. Retuned immediately.,human
"This Vitamin C serum comes in a thick, milky gel formula that's odorless.  It glides over my skin effortlessly and absorbs instantly.  It's comprised of a premium formula that's so powerful, potent, clean and effective that you normally only find it in high-end spas.  This serum reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  The penetrating formula not only cleans and moisturizes your skin, it tightens ans smooths areas around your eyes, chin, neck and cheeks.  It works as a deep cleanser to clean out the oil, makeup and impurities from your pores so your skin reaches a healthier, more radiant look.  The hydrating formula allows your pores to 'breathe' by allowing refreshing oxygen to penetrate your skin.  It's a refreshing change from heavier creams and serums.If you read my reviews regularly, you know I've reviewed many serums, especially Vitamin C serums.  For this reason, I have chosen to use this review entry to share parts of an article that was published by My Awesome Beauty that's titled The Complete Guide to Vitamin C Serums.HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST VITAMIN C SERUM :  FACTORS FACTOR  - VITAMIN C FORMThere really isn’t a “best” form for Vitamin C because there hasn’t been that much research that shows which one is the most stable and still effective.When you are looking for Vitamin C, you should stick to the derivatives or actives that are tested and proven to work, like:ASCORBIC ACIDAscorbic acid has the most supporting research but it is also the most unstable and can be quite irritating at higher concentrations. However, if your skin can handle it, it is the go to active. Just make sure that the serum isn’t oxidized.Still, most companies prefer to use the derivatives because they definitely have longer shelf life, which is critical for a cosmetics company.MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATESODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATEMagnesium ascorbyl and Sodium (pretty much the same) are water-soluble derivatives of Vitamin C that many believe to be the best form of Vitamin C for use in skin care products.They believe this because it is less irritating and is more stable than Vitamin C. Even better, sodium ascorbyl (or magnesium) phosphate has the same potential as Vitamin C in helping with collagen synthesis while keeping the concentrations lower.In the end, for those who have sensitive skin or don’t want redness, sodium ascorbyl phosphate is probably a better choice than ascorbic acid.Still, sodium ascorbyl phosphate can still degrade when it isn’t stored properly or exposed to light and air. Following the “use by” dates on the packaging is a must to ensure your get a product that still “works”.ASCORBYL PALMITATEThis form is the most frequently used fat-soluble (soluble in oils) derivative of Vitamin C in skin products.It isn’t irritating to the skin and is far more stable than Vitamin C. Still, even if it has good antioxidant properties; it doesn’t boost collagen synthesis as much as other derivatives and Vitamin C does.So, if you are going to choose an oil-based product that contains Vitamin C, you want to make sure that it has ascorbyl palmitate.However, it won’t be nearly as effective as ascorbic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, or sodium ascorbyl phosphate.NEW DERIVATIVESThese derivatives are to be avoided because there hasn’t been enough study into their benefits.You might also find other derivatives such as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, which belong to the new derivatives that are slowly hitting the market.If you remember what we said about derivatives, (check the paragraphs above), most vitamin C derivatives on the market, including ascorbyl palmitate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, consist of the ascorbic acid fragment (ascorbyl) and a fragment of another acid (e.g. palmitate or phosphate).These new derivatives have multiple chemical fragments that are bound to a single ascorbic acid fragment that protect against the core Vitamin C.So, as you can guess, it is like having more bodyguards protecting the core vitamin C.They are said to be more stable compared to the other derivatives and Vitamin C itself. Some of these newer derivatives (particularly the tetrasubstituted lipophilic ascorbates) are also said to be more powerful in boosting collagen synthesis. However, you will need to put out a little more cash, which might not be worth it just yet as we still haven’t found enough evidence or studies backing up those new derivatives.TO SIMPLIFY IT, IF YOU HAVE:Normal or Oily Skin: use L-ascorbic acidDry or Sensitive Skin: Use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and redness.We will keep a close eye on the new derivatives and will update our article in 2016, so you can benefit from the most up to date information.NOTE: There are of course other derivatives such as a Ascorbyl Glucosamine, Ascorbyl Glucoside etc… but they really lack studies to warrant use so stay away from those forms for the time being.FACTOR  - WATER BASED SERUM OR OIL BASED SERUMIf your read carefully our previous paragraph, you should be able to answer this question.As you obviously want the most potent vitamin C serum, you will choose the most effective vitamin C forms : the oil soluble vitamin C derivative is not as effective as the water soluble ones, so you should stick with a water based vitamin C serum.You can also notice that all our top  vitC serums are water based because they definitely gave us better results. That is also why most vitaminC serums in the market are water based.The other advantage?These serums are much lighter and will be much easier to add in your skincare routine.As a reminder, apply the serum right after washing your face so to let the serum sink in and give you optimum results.FACTOR  - PERCENTAGE OF VITAMIN C IN THE PRODUCTThe percentage of vitamin C is a tricky factor for formulators (as was confirmed by our cosmetologist and formulator friend).You do need a high amount of Vitamin C to boost collagen production and help with hyperpigmentation but too much can actually cause irritation and redness – and you don’t want to make people have the catch- or being wrinkly or red.The goal is to find that just right spot – which can be harder than you think.The amount that you should look for depends on whether you have the Vitamin C form or the L-ascorbic acid or the derivatives:Ascorbic Acid: Look for -% in the productMagnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate or Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate: Percentages between %-% (remember that these derivatives are as effective in lower concentrations as ascorbic acid ).WORD TO THE WISEWhen you are using Vitamin C serums, and if your skin is pretty sensitive, you should consider starting at the lower end and work your way up to a higher concentration so that your skin isn’t put into shock. You could irritate your skin and make it red and inflamed. Your skin may dry out and peel, which is pretty much the opposite of what you want – dry skin can make you look wrinklier, as was the case for several of our readers and  of our testers with sensitive skins.Try to avoid pure Vitamin C form, like L-ascorbic acid, and work with a derivative around . or % for the first month. That was more than enough for their skin, which showed impressive results. Example here of vitamin c serum for sensitive skins.So the most important criteria is not the percentage but how much % of vitamin C your skin needs to get results and how much you skin can stand.This is a really personalized product and you need to find the right one for you – there is no “one size fits all” option.FACTOR  - PH LEVELSWhen trying to make a decision on what serum to buy, PH levels should be one of the most important things you consider. PH levels tell you how acidic the product is – the lower the pH, the more acidic the product is.Now, many people will believe that stronger concentrations of L-Ascorbic means that the product is superior to something with a lesser amount, but that isn’t necessarily the case. The serum should have a pH level of . max (preferably lower), or it won’t be able to penetrate the skin – which is why it needs to be acidic in order to be effective, but also why it can be an irritant for some people.Skinceuticals is the one that holds the patent for the lowest CE Ferulic serum available on the market, it has a pH between . and .0. Some of the more affordable brands aren’t that far above them though, with pH levels ranging from .0 to ..They can’t make it the same because it will violate the patent – but it is still low enough to be effective.As for the derivatives, the pH problem doesn’t hurt as much because they can go for a more neutral pH.For example, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate has an ideal pH around  or , which is the pH of our skin. This is why some serums that use Vitamin C derivatives will come with a sensitive skin label.Serums that have ascorbic acid: ideal pH of around .0 to .0, which can be irritating for those with sensitive skin.Serums that have sodium ascorbyl phosphate: ideal pH of around .0 to .0, which should not affect sensitive skin.Many brands have a problem with pH, it would seem in our testing. The products weren’t well formulated and the pH was not within the ideal range for the best penetration of ascorbic acid. That’s why some people find vitamin C serums ineffective; they probably came accross a bad formulated serum to start with. Obvioulsy, we did not keep those useless serums in our top .FACTOR  - BETTER INGREDIENTS FOR EFFECTIVE TEAM WORKVitamin C by itself can help your skin, but there is a reason that many of the best products have more than one thing in it.You can’t use one thing and expect miracles, just like you can’t eat a diet of only kale and expect to be healthy…or happy.You need a little more help, which is why it is good to go for a product that has other benefits or beneficial ingredients.Look for products that offer tons of antioxidants, especially if you are trying to avoid aging.In some combinations, antioxidants can strengthen each other and go above and beyond what they can do alone.One of those additions could be hyaluronic acid, which helps to deliver moisture, which can reduce wrinkles.You could also look for aloe vera, green tea, rosehip, andor ferulic acid.Having more won’t hurt your skin; at worst it just won’t help it, so look for a product that will be able to deliver on more than one front.Update: You can find serum with % of L-ascorbic acid,( the most irritant form) but the percentage of vitamin C is not the only criteria to check, I definitely prefer less vitamin C, like % of vitamin C if it means getting several other potent actives in the same serum that will boost the vitamin C action.Remember also as we mentionned it previously, the higher percentage of vitamin C ( L- ascorbic form), the more irritant it can be…. So I know we all want the most effective serum but if you burn your skin… it is not really what you want. So be moderate and build up from there.Keep in mind that usually,The more vitamin C in the serum, the less other actives manufacturers will add. (to keep the production cost moderate)The less vitamin C, the more other actives manufacturers will add. ( as they have more margin to add other pricey actives)Of course, the choice will depend on whether you use other serums or not in your skincare routine. If you only use one serum, it is usually a good move to use a serum with a blend of super actives (vitamin C, acid ferulic etc..). If you use other serums, you can pick the serum with % L-ascorbic acid as you will bring other actives in the battle against wrinkles with your other serumsFACTOR  - SKIN TYPESEveryone has different skin types, from oily to natural to dry – and many of us have all three types at once.Some people will have better results with Vitamin C derivatives while others will prefer to use the L ascorbic form – it is really a testing game until you find the one that works best for you.If you have sensitive skin, a product with a high level of ascorbic acid might harm your skin and you should aim to work with a milder option.Some people will be able to use only a little at a time and work up to the stronger levels, while others will be able to use the stronger products from the start. If you are having problems, a useful tip would be to start by applying the product every other day and work up from there.Go by this rule of thumb when you are just starting out:Normal or Oily Skin: use L-ascorbic acidDry or Sensitive Skin: Use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and redness.FACTOR  - AVOID COLORED PRODUCTSWhen you search for products that have Vitamin C or any derivatives, try to find a product that is white or colourless.Any colouring in the product could hide the signs of oxidation that render the product less effective.You want to be able to see a yellowish or brownish tint.Of course, a lack of tint does not guarantee that your product is free from oxidation as the early oxidation stages are colorless….Some unethical manufacturers (they do exist..) will even add colour to their products so that you can’t spot the oxidation status – so they can even sell oxidised products without you knowing it. ( and they can hide the ugly truth )However, some only do this for marketing reasons – people equate orange or yellow with Vitamin C, so they tint it that so it looks better.Still, we recommend you avoiding vitamin C products that aren’t colorless or white.That way, you will be able to check the degradation status and as a result the effectiveness of your antiaging – product.FACTOR  - PACKAGING & STORAGEProducts that contain Vitamin C and its derivatives have sensitivity to air andor light that makes their quality degrade at a faster rate if they are stored incorrectly.Companies do their best in trying to create packaging that helps keep the products fresher for a longer time, they use opaque tubes, pumps, or air restrictive bottles.You will usually find amber dropper bottle or blue colored dropper bottle, which enables to protect the serum from light. (For your information, amber colored glass is said to protect a little more from light than blue colored glass, but the difference is not that important).What you must remember is to avoid transparent bottles (they cost way less for the manufacturer but it means for your Vit C serum a shorter shelf life….)Yet, to get the best results out of your product, make sure that you close them tightly to reduce the amount of air that can get in and place them away from light.Try to avoid exposing them to humidity – which means you shouldn’t store it in your bathroom. Many people like to store anti-aging products with Vitamin C in the refrigerator! If that doesn’t sound appealing, wrapping them in aluminium foil can help.Once again, make sure that you note the “use by” date on the packaging – they will be your best indicator of whether or not the product still has a change of being effective.FACTOR  - BRAND REPUTATIONYep, would you buy a product from an unethical brand that does not take customer service seriously?Would you even think of spending your money on a company that don’t respect you as a customer?You should also definitely check the brand reputation, check whether the brand is known for selling scams or fake serums.There are unfortunately thousands of crappy brands in the Internet selling you bottles of water with a simple gelling agent to make a serum that they would market as vit C serum.When customers start to complain, they simply take the money and shut down everything. Then, They can create another brand and rinse and repeat….I know it sucks but that is the bad aspect of Internet. As we told you, you will find thousands of vit C serums brands on amazon or other big e commerce websites, they all claim to be the best serum on earthWe bought many serums to test, and were really shocked by some brands selling crap so the big lesson to remember is to be critical….Keep also in mind our reviews don’t necessarily mean, your will get the exact same results as our reviewers. We all have different skin. That’s why we usually like to give you the criteria and elements to know so you can better choose the most suited serum for your specific case.FACTOR  - PRICINGPricing of Vitamin C products can vary greatly.Some of the best products from Skinceuticals are a luxury item while other brands are far more affordable. Of course there are a ton of products that fall right in the middle.Skinceuticals products are great, but they might not be worth the money ( ml bottles for $-) unless you have tons to spend and use $ bills in the bathroom. You can definitely find cheaper serums that are as effective. )On the other side, you also have the serums that cost $ and swear to be the end of all your skin problems. Those brands are created everyday, which proposes serums for $  with % of vitamin C + % of hyaluronic acid, + many other actives that are priceyYou look at the ingredients and see all of the buzzwords, so you think it has to be a miracle.Well, just like fake designer bags on Canal Street, these products tend to fall apart at the seams and not offer the results you’ve been dreaming of. Some of those products might claim that they are % Vitamin C, when you open them up and get a ton of water, you will realize pretty quickly that it isn’t.To sum it up, you can definitely find a good serum that will deliver somewhere in the $-$ range. Take advantage of sales and seasonal deals, as they pop up quite frequently.I chose to share the  Simple Criteria involved in how to choose the best Vitamin C serum because I found it to be very information.  I hop you can too.  I like this serum featured in this entry because it contains Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate.  This is one reason why my extremely sensitive skin does not react to it.  It's also water soluble which makes it more effective and doesn't leave any nasty residue.  There are also other beneficial ingredients present such as Aloe Vera and green tea.  Really, I cannot say enough about this product.I'll sum it up by saying this...This serum is comparable to other better known brands as far as the ingredients and other factors.  Yet, it's available at an affordable price.  Why pay more for the same thing?  I also like the fact they back their product with a % money back guarantee.  If you're not satisfied within  days of purchase, return it for a no-questions asked, % refund.  That's a guarantee you can't really sneeze at.**I received this product at a reduced rate**",human

"Review of the FootSmart Carepeutic Foot and Calf Beauty Massager with Infrared Heated Therapy, model Kh383I, Black, purchased directly from FootSmart 26Nov2010 for $..Received this foot & calf massager as a Christmas present (2010).First Problem:The silver placard ""instrument panel"" had come off and was stuck on the side of the unit instead of over the lights on top of the middle section.  When placard was replaced to its proper position, it would again become unstuck after a day or so.Second Problem:The unit has a receptacle with two jack pins that the power cord plugs into.  The bases of the two jacks were not seated properly and prevented the power cord from being entirely inserted such that the plug itself would not seat properly.  When the unit was being used the vibration would cause the plug to fall out.Third Problem:When using the unit on my feet, the unit eventually damaged my left foot (rollers inside the unit squeeze the feet in an effort to massage them) causing pain for about a week.  A month later my left foot still feels sore on occasion.For the above three reasons I cannot recommend this product.  I am returning unit to FootSmart 18Jan2011 in hopes of getting a refund.TheShopper",human

They are super comfortable and converted a pretty horrible pair of shoes into a a super comfortable pair.  So far they are holding up very well and have not skid around at all.  It does take a couple hours of walking for these to ""mold"" to your foot shape, but once they are broken in they remain super comfortable.  Great inserts.",human
This product did what it advertised.  I purchased it to put medicated lotion on my back and it works.  Instead of having to deal with pads you apply the lotion directly on the end of the paddle and spread it around.  It is lightweight and easy to clean since the application part of the device is vinyl which wipes right off.  I would recommend it as a solution for those who live alone or need to be able to self applicate lotion or medication on areas that are impossible to reach on the back.  It also has a nice long handle which is a nice plus since you are able to reach all the way down your back with it.,human
"They work great. They're ear plugs. I got tired of using balled up Kleenex. The only issue is the vibration noise of the cord traveling into the ear canal when it moves around while trying to study.  I have used a pair of foam plugs from work that have a plastic cord and it's quieter.I like these, tho. I take the cord off to study for school. Doesn't matter as much if I'm doing yardwork or in a high noise environment.",human

I like it a lot.. it works perfect and the suction is excellent.. it cleaned a lot more than others and it is super easy to use and clean it.. if you leave more than  secs on the same spot it will bruise but if used properly it is really powerful..

"I have been on a ketogenic diet for  years. One of the problems is knowing what foods might throw you out of ketosis. There is so much conflicting information and of course each body is different. I have tried keto sticks but they are next to worthless. Although there is nothing better than a blood test to determine the level of ketones, the Ketone Breath Meter is the next best thing. You can't always believe the nutrients that are listed on a package. There are no regulations as to what constitutes net carbs. The only way that you can tell if the food you are eating is throwing you out of ketosis is by testing your ketone level about a half hour after you eat it. The Ketone Breath Meter is an easy, accurate way to do this. In that way you will know for sure.This little device is easy to use and seems to be consistent and accurate. Press a button to turn it on and wait for the  second countdown then blow into it for between  and  seconds. There is an audible beep which tells you when to begin blowing and another audible beep which tells you when to stop. It then displays your ketone level. A reading between . and .0 indicates that you are in ketosis. The first time that I used it I registered .. To me this seems to be very accurate since I rarely have more than 12g of carbs each day.If you have cheat day or days then you probably will be thrown out of ketosis because of the carbs that you ate.  The Ketone Breath Meter will let you know how many days it took to bring you back into ketosis.  In this way you can judge whether the cheat days are worth it.The readings on the meter are large and unambiguous. It comes with  attachable mouthpieces and everything can be stored in a small convenient pouch. If you are serious about a keto diet you need to know your numbers and have the proper information about the foods that you eat. And the Ketone Breath Meter is an economic and convenient way to track your ketone level.",human

Its not overly sweet because it has no added sweetners. Its not mixed with other fruit juices either. Just the red prickly pear fruit puree , citric acid andor ascorbic acid and less than 0.05% grapefruit seed for freshness. Very easy to drink alone or in another beverage.

"I just noticed this and some other brands of carbonated beverages at Whole Foods in the last weeks.  I stopped drinking Coke and other carbonated drinks because of the high fructose corn syrup and the dense concentration of empty calories as spoken about by .  This brands has smaller servings, and less calories. Coke has  calories per  ounce serving meaning almost  calories per ounce.

Ounces Q Kola  Calories8 Ounces Coke  CaloriesAn  ounce serving of Coke has  more calories than an  ounces serving of Q Kola.A  ounce serving of Coke has  more calories than an  ounces serving of Q Kola.3500 calories in a pound of fat, so that is about 1167 ounces more of Q Kola you would have to drink toTo gain a pound of fat you would need to drink  cans of Coke or  equivalent cans of Q Kola,that is you can drink more Q Kola for the same caloric ""price"".I'm just saying that Q Kola tastes pretty good, complex, spicy, sweet and refreshing ... like Cokewith about % of the calories.Plus you will drink less because the bottle aren't  ounces, they are  ounces, though you canget  ounces cans of Coke now and they are cheaper than Q Kola.I will stick with some of these new drinks like Q Kola put my money into more reasonable andhealthy alternatives.That said I am trying to cut down on all soft drinks, and even juice, except real fresh juiced fruitsand vegetables.  I find these smaller less calorie dense drinks a help in that effort, and I also donot like to contribute money to Coca-Cola that has been going on for decades knowing they aare contributing to the sickness and obesity of Americans.--- By the way Q also makes a very interesting tasting ginger ale.

"These types of pills are hit or miss.  They all depend on your body chemistry. I have friends that swear by Rhino brand and some by New Burro, Thumbs up (all the same company), and of course tadalafil and Sildenafil which NONE have worked for me. Unless the purpose was to make my sinuses feel clogged up and give me a headache.Fortunately after days of browsing I came upon AUXILIUM due to its introductory price, I didn't waste any time taking it and it didn't waste my time either. But like most supplements the claims are always a bit ""enhanced"" themselves. Sure I may have had an erection that happen at the wrong time for a long period of time however, these results are NOT consistent and what I experienced you may or may not. My body reacts well to the GoJi despite the risk of digestive discomfort. You can take one to two of these. WITH AT LEAST A 16oz BOTTLE of water. They tend to work better with water and less risk of head ache or that stuffy feeling which I didn't get from AUXILIUM. I wouldn't say I felt  star results but at least  stars. Which led me to try out the product that looks almost identical to AUXILIUM called ""LIFT ~ Rise to Your Potential"".  Slightly different ingredients and price. Same results",human

"I have tried a few different kinds of silicone loofah while trying to replace the classic pouf. This one by far comes closest to what I am looking for. It is not flimsy, the bristles are the right length to make suds and also be easy to clean off. The detachable handle reaches my back easily. It's the right density to scrub but not upset my sensitive skin. Easy to recharge and the battery lasts a while. Would recommend trying it if you're looking for something similar. Wait until it goes on sale and save some $.",human

Not using the crumb catch feature extends the length of the bib. The neck also has several snap closures so you can adjust neck size or how high you want the bib to sit.  Good product!",human
"Amazing, I simply love this mask. I went out looking for alternatives to treat my migraines, my fibro group suggested a migraine mask. I went on searching and can across this mask. I've used it about  plus times already within two weeks and honestly it helps me sleep and also helps with my migraine. Yes the print side where the words are, is definitely colder.Suggestion:  Grab , I should've done that from the beginning like the other reviewers siad, because now I have to wait for the next one to arrive.

"I've been sensitive to garlic for as long as I can remember:  I feel hungover the day after eating it.My Dad, and infectious disease doctor, hypothesized that I had desulfovibrio bacteria in my gut, which produce neurotoxins when given a supply of sulfur (garlic is high in sulfur.  He suggested that I try this product.After taking it daily for  weeks, I carefully ate a meal with a little garlic, and survived without symptoms.  I gradually ate more and more garlic at dinners over the next couple of months, and have never had a reaction.  I'm cured!I don't know if I will need to take this every day for the rest of my life, or if I have permanently changed my microbiome.  I should experiment by stop taking it and see if my cure is permanent, but I am reluctant because its not that expensive and I don't like the symptoms.Thanks Suntory!",human
I have a few problems that taking probiotics help.  I've been looking for an easy to swallow one per day pill.  This one is easy to swallow and has all I need in one pill for the whole day!  Ive had bad experiences with larger pills and on top of that I would need to take two or more a day. I noticed within a week of taking these that my bloating decreased and after a few more weeks completly gone.  Ive been on a healthy diet and the side effects is a bloated stomach which has been frustrating. I am so happy to be able to get rid of the gas and bloating in a one a day easy to swallow pill!,human

"[[VIDEOID:afd7efcc02fc31c5e2809800086f1e82]] This is more of a beard trimmer than hair clippers...My Wahl trimmer has seen it's better days so I thought I would try out this ""hair trimmer"". My first impression is that it isn't the same quality as the Whal. The base of the trimmer is all black plastic, I wish it had a little better grip... like rubber to keep it from slipping out of my hand. It seem to cut pretty good so far (anything is an improvement at this point with my old existing trimmer). It isn't terribly loud. It does not have a -defree turnable blade. Also, no comb, scissors or oil included. The guards are a little difficult to put on at first, but I think that is just because it is new & a little stiff. The guards are ,, & 12mm. It also come with a shaver attachment. The charging cable works with a USB type plug. It does included is a cleaning brush & velvet bag to store everything in. I will update with how well it holds up, but so far it is just an ok product.",human

"This spiked yoga mat for women was exactly what I needed for my back pain. At first, it was a little difficult to get used to the acupressure spikes because they are a bit sharp.

I used this therapeutic mat for my chair in the office and noticed it felt great on my lower back, relieved soreness, and helped with posture. Highly recommend!",human

I hope Spring Valley hasn’t decided not to manufacture this product.",human
Its good. But small.,human
"Very nice synthetic shaving brush, comes nicely packaged too. Would make a lovely gift. Using it with my scented bar soap in place of aerosol shaving creams.

"I bought this because it claimed to be organic and contain organic ingredients, but absolutely NOTHING on the bottle label supports those claims. The labeling shown in the ad that references organic is not any part of the product label. The narrative calls this organic bubble bath. Sadly, it doesn’t appear to be. Either the product descriptions need to be corrected or the product label does. This was a lot to pay for non organic bubble bath.",human
other brands are much better Quality,human
"Unless you have a really big head, i'd be mindful of buying these, as they are quite large. Also, the bifocal portion of the lenses wasn't the best. Product was returned",human
This was wobbly and not safe in my opinion.  I returned it and purchased a different brand that felt more secure.,human
Just what we wanted,human
What I was looking for,human
These are great glasses especially for the price. Clear at the top of the lens and a designated area for reading enlargement. They are also very stylish.,human
"These are by far the lightest pairs of glasses I've ever owned and I've been wearing glasses for + years.  The optics are great and due to their size it's super easy to just let them slide down your nose a bit so that you can look over them when needed.  The fact that they don't have a rim around the top makes 'em as easy to use as expensive progressive lenses.  I got mine for doing computer work.  My distance vision is fine so if I'm working at the computer and have the TV on, I can just turn my head, look over the top of the glasses and I've got the TV in focus without have to mess with the glasses.  Also great for reading and watching TV at the same time.  They are not blue light blocking which I consider a big plus.  I get tired of the tint on the blockers.  My only minor complaint involves the cases.  They're very light duty.  Even the cheapo plastic cases would have been better.  Again, a minor complaint.  Love 'em and highly recommend 'em.",human
These glasses fit my  year old boy perfectly. He does like them but I had to encourage him to use them every time he is looking at the screen. He has had them for about a month dropped them sat on them and still in perfect condition. A great inexpensive way to teach your kids how to care for eyeglasses in case they every need prescribed one’s which are far more expensive to practice on how to care for them with your kids! I tried them on myself and it immediately felt like my eyes were much more relaxed. This is very protective against harmful blue lights from long-term screen use but also if you suffer from headaches this is a good thing to try. I will be buying the adult version for myself !,human
Very poor quality and poor packaging. Ask did not include  of the attachments in the image,human
"I used it on my DRY hair and after one section, the light turned red again. So I had to wait for it to reheat. It happened after every single section. I guess the technology with the cordless flatirons is not where it needs to be yet.",human

"When I ordered these, they were color coded. They arrived with no color coding. These types of packs usually have separate compartments for morning, afternoon… well, the compartments are there, but backwards. They read right to left, not left to right. Evening is first, then afternoon…..moving to morning last. This is for a person with dementia that has different caregivers coming in to help with meds. The labeling is designed to cause confusion and subsequent mistakes in medicating the patient.",human

"I started using this after my doctor told me I needed a hip replacement.  I was in pain all the time, especially during sleep hours.  This unit is expensive but worth it.  Pain has been significantly reduced, and I postponed surgery.  I’m able to ride a bike and hike in the mountains.  What was once horrible pain is now just some discomfort.  My doctor thinks it is quack, but my results tell me otherwise.",human
Used them to fill up with stuff from the piñata.They are of cheap quality and ripped easily.,human
"I bought this item to use for wrinkle prevention. I saw the ingredient on the Dr. Oz show. I mix it with face cream after my sunscreen (or at night) and apply it to my current wrinkles and where wrinkles like to go, then let dry--forehead, nose, eye area, around mouth, cheeks, neck, chest. It does not sting. It's suppose to keep the skin healthier, thus preventing wrinkles--do some reseach on it. I guess the jury is still out because this product is suppose to help you over time, but I gave it  stars because I have hope!Cons: This product smells very bad! I mix it with face cream with a scent to cover up the smell.",human
It all arrived on time and I really like the product.,human
Berry good quality,human
It was the cheapest I could find. Works very well.,human
Great on my fine hair! Easy to use and fast!,human

"If you’re in the market for phytoceramides, look no further! I’ve tried several brands, but this one stands out as the best. My experience has shown that products from Utah tend to be of superior quality, and this one is no exception.",ai
"The instructions mention a “handle” multiple times but fail to clearly identify or illustrate it. Also, while it’s supposed to include two dental cases, mine only came with one. Still, the fit was adequate given the price.",ai
"Very poor quality. The material is itchy, and the craftsmanship is lacking. The item started falling apart almost immediately, and to make matters worse, it’s non-returnable. Strongly advise against purchasing.",ai
Works wonderfully for partials and performs equally well on full dentures. It lasts longer than typical store-bought options.,ai
"Update: This adapter isn’t compatible with brass knuckle round-tip or Stiiizy cartridges but works perfectly for flat-head cartridges. It’s user-friendly, though positioning sometimes requires a bit of adjustment. It enhances filtration, making live resin smoother on the throat. A great addition for anyone looking to upgrade their cartridge-to-water pipe experience.",ai
"I’ve been using this for three weeks, and while it functions adequately, it’s not rust-proof as advertised. Given the misleading claims, I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller.",ai

"Smells wonderful, and the colors complement my bathroom decor perfectly.",ai
"It’s adjustable and easy to attach to mask ear loops. However, it tends to slide down toward my neck, which can be frustrating. While it alleviates ear strain compared to wearing the mask directly, it doesn’t meet my expectations entirely.",ai
"My legally blind mom needed an address book to organize her contacts, and this was perfect. It provides ample space for names, addresses, and phone numbers.",ai
"This is so convenient to use! The wide opening makes it easy to fill with water, and the simple design lets you adjust the temperature quickly. Worked flawlessly right out of the box.",ai
"While harnessing zero-point energy would revolutionize science, the claims surrounding these products lack credible evidence. In-depth research suggests their efficacy remains unproven, and the demonstrations provided often fail to address serious or visible conditions. Proceed with skepticism.",ai
"This is the only product that works effectively for my baby girl, alongside their cream. I’ve used it since she was five months old, and now, at  months, it continues to deliver excellent results.",ai
"Perfect for adding a touch of flair. The material is durable, and the jumbo safety pin ensures it stays securely fastened.",ai
This was exactly as described. It fits my son’s PS Vita and games perfectly.,ai

"Disappointed that the liquid version of Mangosteen is no longer readily available, as the capsules don’t seem as effective.",ai
"After a week of use, I noticed a significant boost in energy and focus, making it ideal for long workdays. The liquid formula absorbs more efficiently than pills, thanks to advanced liposomal technology. Highly recommend it for anyone needing vitamin B12.",ai

"Unfortunately, after months of use, my hair loss remains an issue. Wouldn’t recommend.",ai
This is fantastic for keeping my floors clean and shiny. It’s easy to use and much more efficient than sweeping. A must-have!,ai

Promising so far—seems like a good purchase.,ai
These inserts are fantastic and enhance comfort in all my shoes.,ai
I can’t handle the chalky texture. Into the compost it goes.,ai
"These thongs fit snugly and provide firm support, ideal for special occasions. Sizing runs small, so consider ordering one size up.",ai
Cleans well but lacks a stronger fragrance that I prefer.,ai
"This book is fantastic—great condition, thoughtful prompts, and adorable design. However, completing it requires significant time and effort.",ai
"Not as durable as the original version. Still, it’s an acceptable alternative for those who prefer less height.",ai
My husband likes it—that’s all I know!,ai
"Purchased for my husband’s pain management, and it works wonders! It’s heavy enough for effective use and the strong setting suits our needs perfectly. Might get a backup!",ai
A delightful romantic comedy with a great soundtrack. Highly recommend for fans of lighthearted entertainment.,ai
Excellent product—couldn’t be happier!,ai
Absolutely love it—thank you!,ai
Works great,ai
"This was a sturdy ice scraper. Mine previously had a broken handle. So I was pretty happy with a new one. This was great because not only does it scrape ice off my car, but it also extends. Mine before hadnt done that. Overall, Im quite content with my purchase.",ai
Very unsatisfied with product no type of suction and it keeps cutting off. I will be returning it.,ai
"Cute cover, but as we found out - there are a lot of different Samsungs out there, so this didnt fit. Our fault. Find one for your specific model.",ai
"Its just not what it says it is, and that is all. Sadly and disappointing.",ai
"Bitter, bitter, bitter I still drank it in different ways, hot, cold, in different rooms, lol. I did not receive a relaxed feeling. I do not foresee me purchasing this product again.",ai
Could have sworn I could return this if I purchased through Amazon. Total waste of money Smells awful WASTE OF MONEY.,ai
I love these They are so much better than I anticipated,ai
"These are great 7day pill boxes. They come apart to fill with pills. Once back together, the button in the middle spins by one day with each press. The little dispenser drawer flips down so you can just dump the pills in your hand. Very nice. Lightweight plastic but good quality. Its a little thicker than I expected so my jewelry part use wont work, but I now have colorcoded pill boxes for family travel.",ai
Best glutamine product Mixes well into your favorite drinks Very affordable and great after a workout,ai
Great product at a good price,ai
"It is easy to use, and it works. I was thinking it is just another piece of but it really works.",ai
"SO MUCH SMALLER than what the size chart said, so I dont know where these are made, but they should check their size chart because Im VERY DISAPPOINTED GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER.",ai
Works great Keep them in the car for after car washes,ai
"The three stars are not for the pool itself, which is pretty awesome, but since the company that sells it, Plumstruck, deserves zero stars, I compromised and used three. Other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue, but since the description specifically mentions a ladder, I thought the problem was fixed. When Amazon and I both contacted Plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool, Plumstruck repeatedly ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included. Since the pool is useless, even dangerous without the ladder, this issue must be addressed by the ad. That being said, Amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price, so if the company would just change their wording, people could figure all of this out in advance. Amazon is investigating the company, so hopefully all of this will change. Some people mentioned a heater, but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description. I was actually worried it would only work with the heater and I didnt want to have to use a  outlet, so I was relieved that it doesnt have one. If I decide I need a heater later, I will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation. I will never order anything through Plumstruck again. They are a horrible company. If you can find this pool through someone else, I recommend it. It is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage, but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workout. I also want to add that Amazon sells a saltwater conversion system that my local pool store also sells for a lot more money that the pool representative says will work with this pool, so I will soon be able to convert it to saltwater.",ai
Perfect storage case to encase the massager and long plug,ai
"These are billed as medium toothbrushes. They are super soft, like little kid toothbrushes. I dont even feel like they are cleaning my teeth. No bristle shedding observed tried two of the pack so far. The head and handle are a little rough, but I didnt experience any splinters. But if your mouth is so sensitive you need this level of softness in a bristle, the wood might be too much for you.",ai
"I never thought Id order a broom online, but years ago I bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom I had ever used. I have never found another since then that even comes close. I even replaced the old handle when it broke so I could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones I could find locally. So, I came online to see if I could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after YEARS of hard use. And lo and behold... Amazon had one. I paid significantly more for this one than I did my original one and its worth every penny. This one is bigger... I originally had the . The reason I like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it. Id repurchase this several times over, happily. It has made me a broom snob, lol :)",ai
"I dont actually know if these work or not, because they are so thick that my feet wont fit into any of my shoes if I put these into them first.",ai
"These diapers, if you get the bundle packs off of honestcom, will cost you as much as the organic diapers bought off the shelf. The difference is that these diapers hold sooo well. My son was breastfed the first  months, and breastfed babies poo a lot and its always runny. Never had a leak. Organic diapers along with organic wipes and creams have been the only thing that has helped my son and his super sensitive skin. I highly recommend the whole Honest baby line.",ai
"Stands up great on solid floors. It is also flexible, making it very easy to use. Gives the added stability needed in a way that’s not as bulky as most. I love it!",ai
Loved these! They were perfect for my wedding pies and my guests loved them!,ai
I love it. Smells so earthly. This stuff gives me so much energy!! I recommend,ai
Good masks. Fit well. Liked the assurance of the filters.,ai
Dont think that they are real propolis or worth it.,ai
"I just saw that one of them is already expired. I purchased this on April , 2018. The box was expired on Jan 2018.",ai
Perfect size to grip. Its soft but not too soft. Easy to clean.,ai
Lot  has a funky mixture. Its different than the usual formula. I hope it is safe and as the label states The last shipments have had this lot so Im wondering if this is the last supply of this product since it seems to be out of stock most places,ai
"A little heavy, but its great.",ai
Gets bugs off easy and the bike stayed looking clean Very few bugs stuck after using it.,ai
"I really wanted this to work out, and I was originally excited when I first started using this. I was surprised after charging how quickly the battery died, and now it will not charge after only one use. My poor dog looks goofy because half their body was cut (fur was only a couple of inches and well brushed). I will be returning because I am very disappointed.",ai
"Been using this for a while on my daughter and no rash at all she can use this product without reacting, thank God. It’s the only thing with a scent that she can use.",ai
"Product is a little small, so if you order and want a snug fit, you might want to go up a size.",ai
Smells wonderful!!! This is our second bottle.,ai
"Large amount. Works great for saltwater fly patterns. Only thing Id like to see is a pure white color. Other than that, its perfect.",ai
"Collagen is a part of my daily routine, usually in coffee, since coffee is part of my daily routine. Each packet has  calories and 9g of protein, all from cow collagen peptides. Unflavored, so nothing to interfere or overly sweeten. Pricier than similar collagens, and the serving size is larger than some others as well. Still, these are convenient packets for on the go. The packets are thoughtfully designed, very easy to open. No scissors needed.",ai
Always disappointed when you find out they lie about their size lol. This is NOT  inches more like . This is definitely a mini massager.,ai
This battery is even better than the original batteries that came with my hearing amplifier So far lasting from  am to  pm. We’ll see how long it takes to start running down faster. Great buy.,ai
"This stuff is the absolute bees knees I only couldnt give it  stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted, so about  of it was already spilled out. The product itself worked amazingly! My hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job. And even with gloves on, the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands, nails, and nails bed area in filth! I always seem to get black stains stuck to my skin and the dirt and grime doesnt want to come off without a lot of scrubbing, but when I tried this product, I just applied a small amount to my hands, scrubbed, and it cleaned my hands right up without a lot of effort! The best hand cleaner I’ve used in a long time, and I’ve used a ton of them. Its got a pleasant scent too. Please don’t send out damaged containers again, though!",ai
"This seems like a nice product. However, as far as keeping it off my vanity - it is so large that it really takes up more space than expected. Still keeping it, though.",ai
"This small bottle has been a great help in easing my tension and nervousness. I appreciate that it's made from all-natural ingredients with no harmful chemicals or side effects. I'm a big fan of many Bach remedies, and this one is no exception.",ai
"The brush works well, though it's slightly shorter than expected. It was a bit messy at first with some fibers shedding, but overall, it's the best option for my needs. I needed something that could fit through a narrow bottleneck and preferred to avoid animal bristles for ethical reasons.",ai
These are definitely my go-to masks! They fit my face perfectly and are incredibly comfortable. Highly recommend.,ai
"Unfortunately, these didn’t work for me. They kept slipping off my face, which made them uncomfortable to wear.",ai
"I had to return these as they weren’t usable in the shower. The box clearly stated ""NOT WATERPROOF,"" which made them unsuitable for my needs.",ai
"This is, without a doubt, the best film Ving Rames has ever been a part of. His performance was extraordinary, totally out of the box compared to his usual roles. The way he portrayed a gay drag queen showed an incredible depth of empathy and understanding, deserving of recognition, even if this particular film doesn't qualify for an award.",ai
Absolutely love it!,ai
I bought this at Walmart for $. for a . oz bottle. Great price!,ai
"Unfortunately, I can't use the cover for storing or travel as it doesn't fit securely, and it doesn’t sit properly on the base. The bamboo-like popsicle stick is also a bit of a letdown. Might return it.",ai
"I love the design of the pouring spout – it’s easy to pour quickly, and the attached measuring cup is very convenient.",ai
"After reading numerous frustrated reviews about digital bathroom scales, I can confidently say this one is an exception. It provides consistent readings, varying by no more than 0. lbs, and often stays exactly the same each time. It's a reliable scale and worth the investment!",ai
"This card feels premium, perfect for professional settings. I will continue buying them, and the sympathy cards are a great value too.",ai
L-carnitine is an excellent supplement for overall health.,ai
"I was looking for latex insoles because I love the comfort of latex bed pillows and have used them in some Naot shoes before. These insoles were just as comfortable, but the size options were limited. My toes didn’t fit perfectly in my shoes, but the rest of my foot felt great. I would buy another pair.",ai
Great product and fast shipping. Thanks so much!,ai
"I love this leave-in treatment! I’ve been using it for years, and it smells amazing.",ai
Does exactly what it promises!,ai
"I had given up on curling lashes with old-fashioned curlers, but this rechargeable lash curler works wonders. It's easy to use, has four heat settings, and a cover to protect it when not in use. The best part? It’s rechargeable, so no batteries needed. I prefer curling my lashes before applying mascara to avoid clumping. At this price, it’s a steal!",ai
I’ve used a Genumedi knee support for over  years and was thrilled to find a replacement. It offers the same comfort and high quality as the original. Very pleased with this purchase.,ai
"A perfect large-print Bible for my wife, who is Korean. It’s easy to read and great for anyone who can read Korean.",ai
"Great product, helps with boosting energy levels.",ai
"I’ve been using neroli hydrosol for years and was excited to try this supposedly organic version. Unfortunately, it had an overpowering scent, unlike the mild one I’m used to, and caused irritation on my skin. I doubt it's pure neroli.",ai
This product does exactly what it’s supposed to. Very satisfied.,ai
It arrived earlier than expected!,ai
"I bought this flameless candle expecting it to resemble a real candle, but the cord and plug ruined the illusion. It looks more like a weirdly lit lamp. The scent is nice when you're close, but the overall design is a letdown. Not worth the price.",ai
"The product works well, though the inside finish is a little rougher than I expected. Still, it’s a good buy for the price.",ai
Simply the best out there!,ai
I like this product.,ai
"This breath analyzer is not entirely precise, but it’s great for tracking alcohol levels over time. It’s small enough to keep in your pocket or car key.",ai
"At first, I didn’t like this toothpaste due to its fruity taste, but after using it for two months, I’m hooked. It cleans well and brightens teeth without the grit that other products sometimes leave. The only downside was the long wait for delivery, but it was worth it.",ai
Purchased for my dog – works great.,ai
My wife loves it!,ai
Exactly what I wanted and received.,ai
"Very durable product, and I love that it doesn’t leave grease marks on the outside when food is stored.",ai
I really like these socks. They feel silky and are great for my swollen ankles. I just wish they were available in more colors.,ai
"High-quality part, but it turned out to be too big for my application.",ai
"After using Drip Drop to replace regular water during my dehydration treatment, I was able to remove my PICC line and return to normal activities. I just wish it were more affordable.",ai
As expected.,ai
"This product is uncomfortable, and I can’t fall asleep with it on.",ai
"I like the taste, but I’m not a fan of some of the ingredients.",ai
"There are only two bags in this order, not four as expected. They are very small, more like small and extra-small sizes. While well made and attractive, they aren’t worth the price.",ai
"Perfect product, just as expected. Would recommend.",ai
"These don’t work at all. I still see trails from whatever is digging in my yard, and one of them was even moved after just one night. A waste of money.",ai
"The tags are pretty, but keep in mind that you have to pay for returns.",ai
This product works well and I’m satisfied with it.,ai
"It’s okay, but I thought it would be a little sturdier.",ai
This brush feels great and glides easily through my fine hair. It’s also very comfortable to hold.,ai
"I bought these for facial pain relief, and they fit perfectly. I use flour sack cloths as covers, and they work wonders for my migraines. They have truly made a difference.",ai
Nice and comfortable.,ai
It was really convenient having everything in one package.,ai
These are perfect for my elderly grandmother. She can easily reach her back with them.,ai

"I’m focusing on making healthier choices, and this product is part of that journey.",ai
My holistic doctor recommended this to help absorb toxins. The method is to add - drops to hot water to neutralize harmful components in cilantro. I've been taking it alongside other detox products and herbs.,ai
"Dr. Mercola’s name guarantees quality, and I trust this filter wholeheartedly.",ai
"This kit is not top-tier quality, but it’s a good starting point for learning to tattoo. It includes everything you need to get started: two guns, needles, practice skin, and more. However, there are no instructions, so you’ll have to figure things out online. One of the guns arrived broken, and the other stops working randomly. While the quality isn’t great, this kit can be helpful for practicing on non-skin surfaces. But if you want to tattoo real skin, you’ll definitely need to upgrade.",ai
The product was exactly as described.,ai
"The mat arrived without a protective plastic cover, only shipped in a thin box, but thankfully, it wasn’t damaged. Made in China, it appears to be well-constructed and durable. The bristles are firm yet gentle enough not to cause discomfort. However, the suction cups hold only partially, making it better suited for use on feet rather than the back.",ai
This product has been a lifesaver for my toddler’s eczema! It’s incredibly moisturizing and seems to calm flare-ups effectively. It outperforms similar products like Aveeno. Highly recommend!,ai
Fantastic.,ai
"Exactly as described! The size and look match the listing, and the suction works perfectly—staying in place unless intentionally removed. It shipped in a bubble mailer, and the quality is solid. Great product!",ai
"A delightful addition to my stationery collection! The panda-themed tape is charming and practical for letters, packages, or personal correspondence (though not ideal for business use). As a lifelong panda enthusiast, this tape brings me joy and adds a playful touch to my communication. The ability to cut individual pieces or use it as a roll makes it versatile. Highly recommended for animal lovers!",ai
"My son was experiencing foot pain with his baseball cleats, so I tried these arch supports as recommended by his pediatrician. They worked perfectly—no more discomfort. A great solution!",ai
"This set is ideal for summer! The glitter polish has a beautiful, dimensional sparkle, while the other shades are bright and highly pigmented. You only need one coat for excellent coverage.",ai
"After weeks of searching local grocery stores, I finally found this item. It works wonderfully, making cleaning tasks so much easier. Highly recommend it!",ai
"I’m new to this product, but so far, I’m impressed. I plan to keep ordering—so good!",ai
"If I could go back, I wouldn’t choose the white enamel Kohler sink. Cleaning it is tedious; you need specialized cleaners for stains and marks. It’s overpriced for something that can’t be maintained with simple soap and water.",ai
These filters are a fantastic addition to reusable face masks. They provide an extra layer of safety and reassurance. Highly recommended!,ai
Don’t overlook this movie—it’s amazing!,ai
Thank you!,ai
I love the refreshing feel of Venus Aqua  Deep Moisturizing Cream on my skin. The scent is also fantastic!,ai
"Initially worked okay, but now it won’t even turn on. When it did work, the current was felt more in my hand than at the intended area. Very disappointing.",ai
"Although it arrived later than expected, the eyeliner is decent for the price. It’s not very waterproof or smudge-proof, but it works in a pinch.",ai
"The door operates very slowly and inconsistently. For the price, I wouldn’t recommend it.",ai
A great tool for adding fine details to woodworking projects.,ai
This bag is lightweight yet spacious. I can pack it to its full capacity without issues!,ai
This tonic has boosted my energy and made daily tasks around the house more manageable.,ai
"Great battery life and performance, although it’s slightly heavy.",ai
Excellent!,ai

This recovery drink is a perfect balance of natural nutrition and delicious flavor. It’s hard to believe it’s so healthy!,ai
This large pill organizer is a great value for anyone taking multiple daily medications. The smaller one is handy for travel or gifting.,ai
Simple and easy to use.,ai
I love these vibrant decorations—they’re perfect for entertaining and last a long time.,ai
The item didn’t meet expectations; the chips were mostly pulverized despite being advertised as large. Very disappointing.,ai
"The bag quality is good, but I received adult pandas instead of baby ones, which didn’t suit my crafting project.",ai
Super effective and tastes great!,ai
The detergent performs okay but lacks the minty freshness I was hoping for.,ai
This product is overly loud and ineffective. Save your money—it’s not worth it.,ai
I liked the product.,ai
Lightweight and convenient.,ai
"A reliable solution for noise reduction. Paired with earmuffs, it provides excellent results, especially for sleeping.",ai
Cheap and ineffective—it doesn’t clean well or leave clothes fresh.,ai
"Well-made and versatile sizes. I bought another set for my partner, and she loves it too!",ai
"These soaps are stunning, with beautifully balanced scents. My favorite is lemongrass, but all the varieties are lovely.",ai
This smells incredible—I love it!,ai
A practical solution to prevent scratches and keep glasses in one place.,ai
"While not as comfortable as prescription frames, these are good to have around the house for backup use.",ai
"I searched everywhere for these batteries, but Amazon came to the rescue—quick and reliable as always!",ai
"PROS: The chair has a sleek appearance and feels solidly built. CONS: The leg massage is painful and unpleasant, relying on airbag compression rather than rollers. Even on the lowest setting, it was highly uncomfortable. It lacks features expected in its price range, such as memory settings. Recalibrating the massage heads for height and width every time is tedious. The shoulder and neck massage is weak and difficult to adjust comfortably. The faux leather material is standard but doesn’t add any premium feel. Overall, it feels underwhelming compared to other options in the $,000–$,000 range.",ai
"This face steamer is simple and effective. Fill it with water, switch it on, and wait – minutes for the steam. Once ready, it works beautifully. Setup and operation are straightforward.",ai
I discovered this adhesive while on vacation in Australia and was impressed. It stayed firmly in place on my injured foot without leaving any sticky residue.,ai
A fantastic alternative to heated socks—definitely worth the investment.,ai
"Unfortunately, I received the wrong item: white cheddar crisps instead of my intended choice. Exchanging didn’t feel worth the hassle.",ai
I regret spending so much on this item. It broke completely at the hinge within three months—poor design and not compact. I recommend investing in a higher-quality option to avoid the frustration I experienced.,ai
The item arrived early and made for a wonderful gift—very pleased!,ai
"Perfectly simple and functional cups, great for party favors.",ai
These are adorable! My husband loves how they complement our RV decor.,ai
This product delivers great results for making smokes and saves a lot of money.,ai
Stylish and exactly what I was looking for—love it!,ai

Given as a gift and well-received! The recipient found it beautiful and was thrilled. Highly recommended for gifting.,ai
"While I couldn’t use this product due to my narrow feet, the company was kind enough to issue a full refund.",ai
"Not ideal for thick hair—it takes a long time and requires small sections. However, the curls are lovely if you have the patience.",ai
An excellent product that works just as expected!,ai
"The soft, colorful toothbrushes provide a deep clean while being gentle. Perfect for families, picnics, or everyday use.",ai
"A good brush that gets the job done, though it won’t replace a flat iron entirely.",ai
"Delivers a smooth, close cut—exactly what I needed!",ai
"Three stars because I’m unsure whether the sizing issue was my error or the product’s. It didn’t fit as expected, especially on the extended front piece shown in the product photo.",ai
Very satisfied with this purchase—would definitely buy again.,ai
"Nixoderm is amazing! It cleared my rashes in just a week. It’s been a family favorite for generations, dating back to my childhood in Jamaica.",ai
"I first bought this product in Australia and have been thrilled with the results. My nails, skin, and hair are healthier and grow faster. I highly recommend it over other products for hair, skin, and nails.",ai
Perfect in every way—couldn’t ask for more.,ai
These are well-made and comfortable—a great choice!,ai
"This facial cleansing brush is fantastic! I charged it once and have used it daily for a month. The charge holds well, and the included brush options cater to different needs. It’s been transformative for my oily skin, reducing clogged pores and leaving my face shiny and soft. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a durable and effective facial brush.",ai
"A bit too soft for my preference, but the toothbrush’s excellent features make up for it. I still use it regularly, so it must be doing something right!",ai
Excellent quality—a product worth every penny.,ai
A delicious and satisfying meal replacement option.,ai
"This aromatherapy necklace is stunning and functional. I love that the pads can be swapped for different colors or scents. Whether for personal use or in support of someone else, it’s a versatile and meaningful accessory.",ai
"Yellow readers are rare, but these are a gem! They fit well, the bamboo temples keep cords in place, and they don’t cause headaches. A fantastic find!",ai
"While it cancels some noise, this product didn’t meet my expectations.",ai
"My husband’s snoring was unbearable, but this snoring strap changed everything! It’s comfortable and effective, though it slides a bit during sleep. Overall, it’s a game-changer and worth considering if snoring is an issue in your household.",ai
Simple and reliable—it does exactly what it promises.,ai
The paper is charming and high-quality. Wrapping gifts with it was such an enjoyable experience.,ai
I appreciate the variety of sizes—very practical and convenient!,ai
Crispy with a delightful buckwheat flavor—truly satisfying.,ai
"As I mentioned earlier, this is an amazing deal! I started with this pack and later upgraded to the -pack (,000 papers) when I ran out.",ai
Works exactly as advertised.,ai
"While it kept me from rolling onto my back as intended, the directions were minimal and confusing. The strap is uncomfortable, rigid, and bulky—almost like sleeping on rocks. Strapping it across my chest wasn’t ideal as a woman, so I opted to wear it around my waist despite the directions advising against it. The waist placement worked fine, but I’ll replace the straps with thinner, more flexible ones. Although this was the only option I could find, it could be vastly improved with better design and clearer instructions. Inflating it was also a hassle.",ai
"This chin strap is a major upgrade! It’s strong, well-constructed, and simple to adjust and wear.",ai
"This writing guide has been a tremendous help for my dad and brother, who are losing their sight. It enables them to manage their finances independently, and I highly recommend it.",ai
"Easy to grip and versatile for both wet and dry use. It doesn’t take much effort to achieve a smooth finish, and the labeled design is a nice touch.",ai
"Unfortunately, my initial set arrived broken, and the replacement set broke as well. These are cheaply made and not worth the hassle.",ai
"The product itself is fine, but the packaging is excessive and wasteful. A simple sealed bag would suffice and save costs for both the company and customers. While I trust the product works, I’ll switch to a more affordable option as soon as one is available.",ai
"I first tried the liquid version of chanca piedra for fast relief and later switched to the pill form for convenience. Both worked equally well, but the pills are easier to manage since they require less frequent dosing. This product has been life-changing for managing kidney stones naturally without costly doctor visits.",ai
"This  lb. bag of Organic Whole Grain Hulled Barley is exactly what I expected. It’s decent as a breakfast option with potential blood sugar benefits, but preparation is time-consuming.",ai
Absolutely delicious!,ai
"The hard, round component that fits over the knee was uncomfortable and ended up causing more pain than relief.",ai
"After a long search, I finally found this simple cup with a simple lid at a reasonable price. It’s perfect for making shakes without any unnecessary features.",ai
"The seam along the bottom of the sock makes it uncomfortable to wear, and I noticed the sizing runs large.",ai
"My granddaughter adores her doll! She plays with it constantly, changes its clothes, and truly enjoys this wonderful gift.",ai
"This massage chair is my personal escape. While it doesn’t replace a professional massage, it outperforms the options available locally. A worthwhile investment that leaves me feeling rejuvenated.",ai
Thank you—it’s exactly what I needed!,ai
"This product never fails—I’ve successfully taken a deer every time I’ve used it. That said, it works best when deer are already in the area.",ai
"Delicious and filling, keeping me satisfied until my next meal.",ai
"A fantastic trimmer that effortlessly handles beards, mustaches, and even intricate hair designs.",ai
"After my son teased me about my smaller reading glasses, I switched to these, and they’re perfect! I love that each pair comes with a slim case.",ai
"Purchased these for my husband, and he’s very happy with them. The fact that they fold flat for easy storage in a drawer or under a chair is a great feature.",ai
"I expected this product to remove hair entirely, not just trim it down.",ai
"While results may vary, I found this product unpleasant and irritating to my sensitive teeth. The pen is harder to use than strips or trays because it’s difficult to get into tight spaces. Sensitivity became an issue almost immediately, making it a no-go for me.",ai
"I do think this product works. Years ago, I used it right after finishing a round of Crest Whitestrips, which didn’t show much effect on their own. With Celebrity Sexy Teeth, I saw quick and dramatic results. The name might seem questionable, but it truly delivered. Perhaps the combination of the two products made the difference.",ai
"Delivery was prompt, and the product matched the description perfectly.",ai
"Simply plug it in and enjoy a bubbling Jacuzzi-like experience in your tub. It can be a bit loud, but placing the canister outside the bathroom door helps. Ideal for small spaces and incredibly relaxing—hard to leave the tub!",ai
"A good idea in theory but unsafe in practice. The silicone tip detached and went down our dog’s throat on the second use. Thankfully, our dog is large and wasn’t harmed, but this could be dangerous for smaller pets. Not recommended.",ai
"Shipping was slow, but the quality of the image was good.",ai
The product does not hold up as shown in the pictures—quite disappointing.,ai
Beautifully crafted bags. I’ll definitely purchase them again.,ai
"Slightly smaller than expected, but still a good value overall.",ai
"I first found this product at HomeGoods for $.. After failing to locate it again, I paid double online, and it was worth every penny. The taste is pleasant, and I noticed improved joint flexibility within two days. I hope to find it in-store again, but I’m willing to pay more for the benefits.",ai
"My one-year-old grandson loves this little panda! He carries it everywhere, scribbles with it, and erases by pushing the nose. Such a cute and fun product.",ai
"A unique product with strong vibrations and several mode options. The tight rubber ring can stretch the skin when moved, but it adds to the experience.",ai
"Works only on hard surfaces due to the small rollers, which don’t lift properly on carpet.",ai
"With multiple pets, keeping the floors clean is a priority. My Swiffer does an okay job, but this mop and its reusable heads make my floors look spotless every time.",ai
"The koala cloth was lovely, but the leather cord had an overpowering chemical smell. Attempts to remove the smell made the leather stiff and unusable for now.",ai
"None of the instructions or details were in English, and the contents had a strong chemical odor.",ai
A straightforward and effective solution—very easy to use.,ai
"The package only included five items instead of the advertised six, but they work well.",ai
"The taste was unbearable, and even mixing it with juice didn’t help. The aftertaste was equally unpleasant.",ai
Exactly what I expected—always a reliable purchase that works perfectly.,ai
"Initially, I was upset because the product seemed like a cheap piece of styrofoam. However, after using it for back pain relief, I slept pain-free for the first time in weeks. It works as promised and deserves high praise.",ai
"If I could give zero stars, I would. This product is rigid, crinkles immediately, and is unusable for wrapping gifts. Avoid at all costs.",ai
"Using this device caused me immense pain. Despite the positive reviews, I can barely sit or stand after trying it.",ai
"As a professional nail technician, I love these nippers! They’re sharp, durable, and I’ll definitely repurchase regularly.",ai
One of my go-to tools for use while watching TV on the couch.,ai
"The scent doesn’t resemble sandalwood, and the lack of a plastic seal makes me suspect it was tampered with. Extremely dissatisfied.",ai
A great paint cleaner to use before waxing—it effectively removes dirt and swirl marks.,ai
"Replacing two smaller filters with this larger one was a smart choice. It’s easier to handle, and the spare ensures my furnace stays happy.",ai
These are surprisingly sharp—handle with care!,ai
"This product worked wonders for my husband, who was losing his voice due to throat muscle atrophy. After one month, his voice has fully recovered, and it’s been a cost-effective alternative to therapy.",ai
"Love the color! The tip is loose and needs occasional tightening, but it’s manageable. However, there’s no safety shutoff feature, so be cautious to avoid accidents like the one we had when it burned the carpet.",ai
"The variety box included only two flavors instead of the advertised selection, which was disappointing. While the taste was okay, the sunflower flavor had a slightly stale, oxidized quality.",ai
"Bought this as a gag gift, but it turned out to be incredibly useful. The recipient uses it all the time and loves it!",ai
A refreshing alternative to standard lemon cologne.,ai
"Fast shipping, no complaints.",ai
"Bought these for my mom, and she couldn’t be happier with them.",ai
Sturdy and sharp—excellent quality!,ai
"Just as described, very satisfied.",ai
"The directions were only in Chinese, and the packaging looked cheap, like something from a dollar store. Very disappointed.",ai
I was initially frustrated by the lack of product details but ended up delighted. It’s big enough for a large bulletin board and comes with a border and instructions for placement. The design is engaging for young children.,ai
"This product did not meet the manufacturer’s claims. While it provided minimal results, it didn’t live up to expectations. I wouldn’t recommend it.",ai
"My daughter has always struggled with swimmer’s ear, but this headband and ear plug set has been a game-changer. The silicone plugs are soft, moldable, and effective, while the band keeps them secure and prevents water entry. Fantastic product!",ai
"The floss is thin and harsh on gums, but I bought it for the reusable jar. I’ll use a different brand for refills.",ai
"These bags were a lifesaver during the holidays! Sturdy, cheerful, and available in various sizes, they made gift wrapping a breeze.",ai
I wish this product was still available. The white coating is helpful for those sensitive to red dye.,ai
"I love water transfers, but these were inflexible and tricky to apply. They also transfer incorrectly and require flipping over. An okay product, but I wouldn’t repurchase.",ai
"Lightweight and comfortable sunglasses perfect for everyday use and outdoor activities like hiking, biking, or golf. Great lenses and frames.",ai
I can’t sleep without this pillow! I don’t use it for my neck but between my elbows to keep my shoulders aligned. It prevents knots in my upper back—highly recommended.,ai
"This container is ideal for travel or everyday use! Whether it's medicine, earrings, or other small items, it provides an excellent way to keep them safe and organized.",ai
Just as described!,ai
"Unfortunately, this did not meet my expectations. The suction power was too weak to effectively pump, and anything beyond level  caused discomfort. Despite trying for over  minutes, I only collected a small amount of milk. When attempting to pour it into a bottle, the suction part detached, spilling the milk everywhere. Very disappointing.",ai
Good quality product.,ai
These work perfectly and fit the brush exactly as needed.,ai
"I’m giving this a shot, and since it contains mostly natural ingredients, I’m hopeful it won’t interact negatively with my other medications. Hot flashes and night sweats are a nightmare, and I’m really looking for something to help manage them. However, the word “promotes” in the product description feels a bit off. It would have been more reassuring if they used terms like “prevent” or “help ease.” I’ll see how it works after completing the full bottle.",ai
The odor is very strong. I need a few more weeks of use to provide a more thorough review.,ai
"These forms are great! They look and feel nice, and the price is affordable. The quality is excellent, and I’m very satisfied with my purchase. The seller’s service was great too.",ai
"Our dog has been using this for a year now, and it’s still going strong. We didn’t receive the soap, but we bought the On Guard soap separately, and it’s great. I’ll definitely purchase again.",ai
"Works decently well, but be cautious if you have sensitive skin.",ai
"This product doesn’t clump at all, which is fantastic. The flavor is amazing, and the Beta-Alanine kicks in gradually, which helps me feel it throughout my body, not just a quick burst. I would definitely repurchase.",ai
"After searching several RV websites for replacement clips for our sliding doors, I finally found these. They're made from strong plastic but can become brittle over time. These clips worked well and helped keep the doors secure while traveling.",ai
I bought these for my nieces and nephews because I loved them as a kid in the 70s. The kids enjoy them too!,ai
Great product!,ai
"This will not connect to a hose outdoors, so be aware of that.",ai
I go through gallons of this every year. I don’t leave home without it.,ai
This is all you need to clean anything and everything.,ai
"I purchased this for my blind brother, so I can’t speak much about its functionality. However, he mentioned that while the volume could be louder, he still likes it and finds it helpful.",ai
Super cute product!,ai
"My experience with Pink Zebra has been terrible. Not only did the items I ordered smell awful, but trying to return them has been an absolute nightmare. Customer service has been unresponsive, and I’m left with no resolution after nearly a week. I’ll never order from them again.",ai
This is exactly what I was searching for.,ai
"They look a little nerdy, but they work wonderfully. I use them for driving and walking in the sun.",ai
Loved it!,ai
Very comfortable and keeps sandals from sliding around.,ai
High-quality brass brad—just what I needed.,ai
"These energy pills are amazing! They help me stay focused and energized, and I’ve had no side effects. Great price for a product that works effectively.",ai
"These capsules are smaller than others I’ve used, but that’s actually great because they fit perfectly in my pillbox. They work well for me.",ai
"I have CKD and anemia, and these B12 capsules have been very helpful for my kidneys and hemoglobin levels.",ai
"I bought these in XXL for myself and was very happy with them. I ordered a smaller size for my grandson, but the quality didn’t meet the same standards. The socks are still comfortable, but I’m not sure I’ll be purchasing from this seller again.",ai
"I’ve been storing this in my skincare fridge and using it to apply serums in the morning. It feels amazing and helps reduce puffiness, especially on my jawline.",ai
This product truly works!,ai
Comfortable to wear with sandals—great addition to my wardrobe.,ai
"Update: I initially really liked these sleep masks, but after using them for a while, the red one left black marks on my sheets, which won’t wash out. The earplugs are a nice touch, and I like that there’s no pressure on the eyelids. However, I had to adjust the nosepiece to make it more comfortable, and I’m concerned about the longevity of the mask.",ai
"Unfortunately, this product didn’t help with my back pain. I would not recommend it.",ai
"This BCAA drink works well as a hydration supplement. The flavor tastes more like a beverage than a supplement, which is a plus. If you want a stronger flavor, you might need to use more, but I recommend using less to make it last longer.",ai
Excellent product with great flavor.,ai
"I love this laundry detergent! It cleans well and is eco-friendly. Plus, it smells wonderful. I’ve used several products from this company and have had a great experience every time.",ai
"This product has really helped with my back and rib cage pain. The only issue I had was that one of the straps dug into my shoulder, but that might just be a personal issue.",ai
We love this product!,ai
"I ordered this as an indoor mosquito repellent. It works well but not as effectively as the Vanilla #. If you come across it, please let me know!",ai
"These stockings are soft and comfortable. They stay in place all day, and they’ve been great after my sclerotherapy treatments.",ai
"I love this SPF  lip balm! It’s smooth, not greasy, and the flavor is subtle. I’m glad I got the -pack because now I can apply it freely without worrying about running out. Great deal!",ai
This is perfect for my little minion!,ai
"The fabric is very nice and easy to work with, plus it’s adorable.",ai
This product has an amazing smell! It’s wonderful for adding gloss to natural hair or braiding hair.,ai
"It was easy to assemble and such a great purchase. It’s not only a gift box for my daughter’s present but also perfect for storing her toys, drawings, and cards.",ai
This is perfect for my son with ADHD and my son with autism!,ai
They do exactly what they claim to do.,ai
"After removing my nails post-Covid, I found it hard to clean my scalp properly. This product works like a charm, massaging my scalp the way my nails used to.",ai
"I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this cast iron cleaner. It’s easy to use, and I’ve had no issues cleaning my pans or baking trays. Highly recommend this cleaner.",ai
"While I really like this product, the goggles are slightly small for a -year-old.",ai
"I have severe insomnia, and unfortunately, this product didn’t help me, even after taking more than the recommended dose. However, the company offered a % money-back guarantee, which I appreciate. So,  stars for the company, and  stars for the product itself—though it might work for others.",ai
This lash curler works wonderfully. It curls all lashes evenly and includes a light to help you see as you curl. The rubber changes color from red to white when it's ready to use. Keeping it clean ensures amazing results!,ai
"Cleans thoroughly, smells great, and is safe for cloth use.",ai
"We’ve been using these liners for our -month-old since birth, and they work great, even though he is a heavy wetter. They’re incredibly soft and fit perfectly into any cover, including our favorite, the Ramparooz covers, which don’t have snaps. These liners stay in place and do their job!",ai
"This is a quality piece for the price. It’s perfect for my PA, especially since I don’t like the large diameter rings.",ai
"This product works wonders for menstrual cramps and is incredibly effective. The only downside is that it’s quite expensive, and I tend to use a lot of it, so it doesn’t last as long. Nonetheless, I’m on my second bottle and plan to stick with this brand, as it’s much easier to ingest than other harsher options.",ai
This is perfect as a party favor!,ai
"Ted’s Pain Gel has been surprisingly effective for pain and discomfort. To get the best results, follow the instructions to use it - times a day for the first week.",ai
A great replacement part for the Decor SeaSprint throttle pin. Just make sure to observe how the old pin is installed before removing it.,ai
"This is very thin and too short for use on a thigh. Even on a calf, it doesn’t wrap well.",ai
"These are super cute and really soft. They’d make a great # present to accompany a # gift or could even stand alone as a # gift. I bought three of these heart pillows and gave one to my best friend's daughter, who absolutely loves it!",ai
I love it! It works exactly as expected.,ai
"I chose these because of their solid red and white colors, which is exactly what I wanted.",ai
"The quality of this eye mask is average, and the craftsmanship isn’t outstanding, but it’s okay for temporary use.",ai
"Works well! My wife used it to trim an ingrown toenail, and it did the job just fine. It’s very sharp and outperforms regular nail clippers.",ai
Great price and good quality—very satisfied!,ai
I like it a lot. It’s very convenient to use.,ai
"Unfortunately, it didn’t work the way I had hoped.",ai
"🌞🌞🥲 These do not darken as shown in the pictures. Instead, they only get a slight gray tint in direct sunlight. I should have returned them, as they don’t function like sunglasses at all. Very disappointing, especially since they didn’t offer much protection from the harsh Texas sun! 🌞🌞😎😎😎",ai
"We bought these for our guests at the wedding and reception, and they were perfect.",ai
"This product works better than anything I’ve tried, and it keeps working. I’ve used other energy supplements that stopped working after a while, but I’m on my second bottle of this one. Definitely sticking with it.",ai
"Not only was the product from a different brand, but the ad was misleading. It showed  boxes, but only one arrived, making this purchase overpriced. To top it off, the item is non-returnable.",ai
"I bought this for my wife after she gave birth. The binder is well-made and fits perfectly, although it’s a bit stiff, but it should soften over time. It provides great support and works as intended. Definitely recommend for anyone needing an abdominal binder. (I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.)",ai
"The distributor was easy to work with when I needed to return it, but the product seemed poorly manufactured. I ended up purchasing one from another site, although it was more expensive.",ai
"I ordered these after seeing them on TikTok for cleaning. When they arrived, I was surprised at how much larger they were than expected. The kids are excited to use them for outdoor fun this summer!",ai
"This is an excellent product. I bought it to help after knee and hip surgery, and I was impressed with the quality given its affordable price. It’s a great wheelchair and can even be used as a substitute for a walker. When you're up and about, you can use the seat to carry items like laundry or books. Highly recommend it.",ai
"Unfortunately, this product stopped working after the first use.",ai
"I don’t recommend this toothbrush. The heads fell off while brushing, there’s no timer, and no indicator light showing it’s charging. Waste of money!",ai
"These tissues are fine, but I needed them to be the size mentioned in the description ( x ). The packaging, however, states they’re ” x ”.",ai
"This product exceeded expectations! My daughter found Rocyalox simple to use and is thrilled she no longer needs to rely on rubber bands. Highly recommend this product, five stars all the way!",ai
It works wonderfully with dentures.,ai
"This is my first foam roller, and I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It's quite firm, which is expected, but it's smaller than I anticipated. I wish it were a bit bigger, but it still works well for stretching out my back. It took some getting used to, but overall, it's a solid product.",ai
"Small metal tray, exactly what I needed. I had been searching for a deep tray for some time. The artwork is sharp and clear, no pixelation. After a month of use, the graphics haven't worn or chipped. Easy to clean with rubbing alcohol. I'll likely buy again, especially if they offer a larger size.",ai
Immediate relief! Fantastic product.,ai
"I placed it on my desk on top of a notebook, and when I returned, it had left an oily stain on the paper. Not ideal.",ai
"These were perfect tablecloths for our sports-themed party. They look like grass, complementing the decorations beautifully. They're a bit thin, so they're really meant for one-time use.",ai
Excellent quality.,ai
"Perfect for parties, dinners, and more.",ai
"I bought these thinking they would be similar to other shower shampoo brushes I've used before, but they're not. These have thicker teeth, making it harder to brush through hair, and the plastic isn't soft. When using in the shower, I tried clipping the T-handle to the showerhead, but it constantly slips off after a few seconds. I also noticed that one of the brushes deformed after prolonged exposure to my hair products, which was disappointing. I won't be buying these again.",ai
"Absolutely terrible. The product looked and felt nothing like the picture. I had to double-check that I received the correct item. This has been my worst Amazon purchase, and I returned it immediately.",ai
"This Vitamin C serum comes in a smooth, odorless, milky gel that applies effortlessly and absorbs quickly. It features a high-quality formula that rivals those found in premium spas. The serum reduces fine lines and wrinkles, tightens, and hydrates the skin, giving it a fresh, radiant appearance. It works as a deep cleanser, removing impurities while promoting collagen production. The hydrating properties help skin ""breathe"" by allowing oxygen to penetrate. I've tried many Vitamin C serums, but this one stands out for its gentle yet powerful effects. It's ideal for normal to oily skin types.",ai
These wipes turned out to be too thin and not of great quality. They're only useful if you specifically need kosher wipes.,ai
Complete waste of money. This pump has absolutely no suction power. Very disappointing.,ai
Exactly as pictured.,ai
"Received this FootSmart Carepeutic Foot and Calf Massager with Infrared Heated Therapy as a Christmas gift in 2010. Unfortunately, there was an issue with the silver placard, which had come loose and was stuck on the side instead of being on the top as intended. While it was easily fixed, the product still works well for foot and calf relaxation.",ai
"While the idea behind this product is great, the material used does not hold up well. It feels flimsy and doesn't meet expectations for durability.",ai
"The product initially worked, but its power was weak from the start. It only functioned a few times before failing to recharge, which was disappointing since recharging was the key feature.",ai
"These compression socks are by far the most comfortable I've worn. With a variety of vibrant colors, they surpassed my expectations. I was so satisfied that I discarded all my old pairs. The price is excellent, and I’ve already ordered three more sets with plans to buy more in the future.",ai
"I really liked the design of this hookah, but unfortunately, it arrived damaged and sits crooked. Thankfully, I was able to get a refund and used glue to fix it. It still works, but the initial quality was a letdown.",ai
"The key I ordered worked perfectly for my toolbox that I had lost the original key to, so it solved my problem efficiently.",ai
The two people I bought this for absolutely loved it. They had a great time using it and have no complaints about its quality or performance.,ai
"Initially, this brush seemed impressive in both appearance and feel. However, after use, it didn’t do much to clean pores as promised. It's a nice-looking brush but falls short in performance.",ai
"This little box is exactly what I needed. It was easy to assemble, and the lid closes securely. Simple yet effective design.",ai
"The quality is excellent. I am very satisfied with this purchase, and it definitely met my expectations in terms of sturdiness and reliability.",ai
"I was disappointed to find that the set included soccer and basketball leis, which weren’t mentioned in the description. I was hoping for Hawaiian leis exclusively and have decided to return the item.",ai
"I used these insoles in a pair of cheap slip-on shoes, and they worked wonders. Easy to trim, and they fit perfectly. They’re incredibly comfortable and have turned my once uncomfortable shoes into a much better pair. After a few hours of walking, they molded to my foot shape and have held up well.",ai
"This tool did exactly what it was advertised to do. I bought it for applying medicated lotion to my back, and it works well. The vinyl end is easy to clean, and the long handle makes it convenient for reaching my back. Great for those who need help applying medication to hard-to-reach spots.",ai
"These earplugs work well, and I no longer need to use makeshift options like balled-up tissues. The only drawback is the noise from the cord when it moves around, which can be distracting during quiet study sessions. I don’t mind it for other activities like yard work, though.",ai
"The product met my needs, but I was disappointed to find that many were broken, and the plastic material was not as expected. The packaging did not include the description details, so I will not be ordering again.",ai
"This device works effectively and has strong suction power. It’s easy to use and clean, and it helped with blackheads after consistent use. If you leave it in one spot too long, it can bruise, but otherwise, it’s powerful and does the job well.",ai
My daughter loves this toothbrush. It’s the perfect size for her small mouth and makes brushing much more comfortable for her.,ai
"The taste is unpleasant, but I have to admit it helped me get pregnant! I just wish it came in tea bags rather than a powder form, as that would be more convenient.",ai
"After being on a ketogenic diet for two years, I found this Ketone Breath Meter to be the most accurate way to test my ketone levels. It’s easy to use and provides clear results. I can now better track whether certain foods throw me out of ketosis. It’s a great tool for anyone serious about keto.",ai
This product does exactly what it claims. Simple and effective.,ai
"The packaging was disappointing, very generic and small. It’s not something I would feel comfortable giving as a gift.",ai
"These shoes caused me a lot of discomfort, to the point where I couldn’t stand for long. Unfortunately, returning them cost me more than I paid for them in the first place.",ai
"The product works just as expected. It performs well and meets my needs, no surprises.",ai
"I was specifically looking for a long chain (around - inches), and this one is perfect. I bought two, and they arrived in - days. The copper-colored beads still look great after a month of use. However, it is currently unavailable.",ai
"This mop is hands down the best I’ve ever owned. The exchangeable pads are so convenient, and it’s super easy to wring out. It’s been a few months now, and it’s still holding up well. The quality is top-notch.",ai
"This product is fantastic, and I highly recommend trying it! I had a small issue, but the customer service team resolved it quickly and efficiently.",ai
"This is a great option for my mom, who is legally blind. She can easily check the time, and I'm especially happy that I found it in Spanish, which makes it even more useful for her.",ai
"I love these so much that I bought six! They are the perfect size for all the medications I'll need on my -week vacation. Easy to pack and I really enjoy the fun patterns. I had a similar product before, which worked great, and I expect the same quality from these.",ai
"Unfortunately, these don't stick very well and they are not anti-slip as advertised.",ai
"These socks are incredibly comfortable. The compression is just right, and they also look fantastic.",ai
"I was thrilled to receive my order in just  days! I have digestive issues (IBS-C), and this Nopal Eye Prickly Pear puree really helps with inflammation and pain relief. It’s not too sweet, and I appreciate that it contains no added sugars. This is a fantastic product, and I think it’s better than the more expensive alternatives I’ve tried.",ai
"This product is more of a gel than an oil, so I wouldn’t recommend it for massage since it absorbs too quickly. Additionally, it doesn't have a strong chocolate scent, which I was expecting.",ai
"This set is perfect for caring for a newborn puppy. Though it's single-use, you can still boil them to sterilize. It's essential to measure properly and watch tutorials for safe tube feeding, but it’s definitely a lifesaver.",ai
"The taste wasn't great, and it didn’t work as well as I had hoped.",ai
"This lash curler has silicon teeth that help separate lashes, especially after mascara, giving a more natural look. It's affordable and comes with several replacements, which I appreciate.",ai
This product fit perfectly as expected.,ai
"I wish it was clearer, and sometimes it slips off my vape. However, I dropped it once, and it protected my vape perfectly.",ai
"These brush heads are not as soft as I expected based on the description, which led me to think they would be gentle for sensitive teeth. However, they do fit properly.",ai
"Recommended by my doctor, and it works well for me.",ai
"I love the size and charging capabilities of this product! The sound quality is great, and I appreciate the multiple options available. The light changing feature is beautiful!",ai
"These bars are fantastic—low sugar, high protein, and full of probiotics! They keep me full, sometimes even to the point where I can’t finish the whole bar. My kids love the flavor too, and I prefer this one over the almond flavor. It's hard to find them in stores, though—I wish they were more widely available.",ai
"While the mint flavor is pleasant, this gum did nothing to curb my appetite, and it's a bit pricey. I would recommend saving your money.",ai
"These work well and do their job, although they’re a bit hard to breathe through. Honestly, this makes me feel like they’re effective, though!",ai
I’ll be making my next purchase soon!,ai
"The construction is sturdy, and it seems like it will last a long time.",ai
"I recently discovered this brand of carbonated drinks at Whole Foods, and I’m really impressed. After stopping my consumption of sodas like Coke due to their high fructose corn syrup and empty calories, I wanted a healthier alternative. This brand offers smaller servings with fewer calories. For example, an -ounce serving of Q Kola contains just  calories, compared to Coke’s  calories per  ounces. The taste is complex, spicy, and refreshing, offering a similar experience to Coke with about % of the calories. Plus, the smaller bottles help keep calorie intake lower. I prefer Q Kola as a healthier, more reasonable option over Coke and other sugary drinks. Additionally, Q makes a sharp, spicy ginger ale that’s surprisingly sophisticated, although a little strong for me to drink straight. It’s a great alternative if you’re looking to cut back on soft drinks and want something with fewer calories.",ai
"I was disappointed to find that there is no ginseng in this product—only benzocaine, which I can buy cheaply elsewhere. Not worth the price.",ai
"I had great results with the PMD Arsenal Elite Inferno, so I decided to try the PMD Arsenal X Inferno. After placing two orders, I found out that the product doesn’t even exist despite being listed and pictured online. Very frustrating!",ai
"These insoles are exactly what I was looking for! They're thin yet supportive, perfect for wearing in my sneakers. Very comfortable.",ai
Good product. I would recommend it.,ai
"The squirrel patrol needed a tail for their flag, and this one worked perfectly for the scouts. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a tail!",ai
"I bought these for a friend, and they absolutely love them. My friend says they work wonderfully.",ai
"I really like the design of this mask, and the fabric is comfortable. It has held up well to hand washing, though I haven’t tried machine washing it yet. I gave it  stars because the mask didn’t conform well to my face, and there were gaps that let allergens in. Since I can sew, I added a metal strip from a disposable surgical mask to improve the fit, and now it conforms much better. This should have been part of the original design.",ai
The product was too short for my needs.,ai
"I've been using this product for years to keep my feet smooth, and it’s been consistently effective.",ai
"This product has proven to be quite useless. All it does is poke a small hole in your filter, which is something I could easily do with a pin. Not worth the purchase.",ai
"I absolutely loved this book! It took me back to a simpler time, reminiscent of small-town life and the friends I’ve had over the years. The setting in the Smokies made it even more special, especially since I’m lucky to live here. If you want to take a nostalgic trip, this book is a great choice. Now, I'm craving some trout for dinner!",ai
"I’ve recently started using K-beauty products, and I’m really impressed. The only downside is the scent, which I didn’t love at first, but it fades quickly. Overall, it’s a great product.",ai
"This product is very noticeable and not the most flattering. It might work better with a different kind of frame, but overall, it didn’t meet my expectations.",ai
"I’m a big fan of patriotic items, and this pill box is exactly what I needed for a short trip. It’s both functional and has a great design.",ai
My boyfriend loved these for his terp slurper! Definitely a great purchase for him.,ai
"This product is excellent, and the customer service that came with it was top-notch. Highly recommend!",ai
"This is the only chapstick I can use without having an allergic reaction. All other brands cause rashes and blisters, but this one works perfectly for me. The only downside is that I can’t find it in any stores near me.",ai
"After taking supplements for  years, I’ve finally found an affordable multi that works great. I feel healthy, and even though my diet hasn’t always been perfect, I attribute this to my Vitalert. I’ll continue using it as long as I can!",ai
"These products look great! They’re strong and sturdy, just what I was looking for.",ai
"Honestly, these are no better than using a wet rag. Not very effective in my opinion.",ai
"I can’t recommend Splatt enough. I first tried it when exchange students left it at my house, and now I refuse to use traditional toothpaste. Since 2018, this product has helped with my cavities, sensitivity, and fresh breath. It’s cleaner, whiter, and just works better overall.",ai
"These weren’t the same ones I purchased before and felt poorly made. I’m glad there were three in the pack, but I’m not sure they’ll last long.",ai
"I love this room fragrance, especially the sandalwood scent. It’s pleasant without being overpowering, and my husband also enjoys it. It lasts for about six months and is a nice refresher when expecting guests. Given that it's imported, the price seems fair.",ai
"I received this product in poor condition. It was old, and some of the product had already leaked out of the packaging. Very disappointing.",ai
"I’ve been using this product for years, and it works great for keeping acne at bay. It doesn’t irritate my skin, either. Very satisfied with the results.",ai
This stash capsule is perfect for storing my meds for the day and some emergency cash. Great for on-the-go convenience.,ai
These are awesome! They really help keep my bubbler clean. Thanks for such a great product!,ai
"I had a total knee replacement five weeks ago and was advised to use ice as much as possible. I had a smaller version of this ice gel bag and loved it, so I upgraded to this larger one. It works perfectly for my needs.",ai
"This is the only Seriphos supplement I’ve found that actually works. It’s helped balance my serotonin levels, and eventually, I’ll be able to stop using it altogether. I’m really glad I found this product.",ai
"We’ve been using this product for our newborn, who is now  months old, and it has been amazing. It keeps him calm and happy. The battery life is great, and it’s durable enough to use for hours each day. We would definitely buy it again if anything happened to it.",ai
"Great product, good price, and it was delivered on time. Very happy with the purchase.",ai
These toe inserts didn’t return to their original shape and are not effective. They’re dried up and look like a cheap man-made substance.,ai
"This supplement has really helped with my digestion and fluid systems, including both saliva production and urinary fluidity. I take  tablets a day, six with breakfast and lunch, and it’s been very effective.",ai
Easy to use and works well. No complaints here!,ai
"I’ve noticed a slight improvement in my stream since taking this supplement. Not a huge difference, but it’s exactly what I was hoping for in just three weeks.",ai
"Supplements like this are hit or miss, as they depend on your body chemistry. I’ve tried several different brands, but AUXILIUM has been the most consistent for me. It did give me some unexpected results, but overall, I would say it’s worth trying, especially with the water intake. I’ve also tried a similar product, ""LIFT,"" which had very similar effects.",ai
I love it! Simple and effective.,ai
A great bargain for something so cute and useful!,ai
"I absolutely love this dish soap. It’s gentle on my hands, smells great, and cleans dishes perfectly. What more could I ask for?",ai
"I enjoyed the brush overall. It has nice firm bristles, and the long handle is beautiful. My only issue is that the handle doesn’t click into place like other brushes, so it falls off sometimes. But it hasn’t been a major problem once I get it in place.",ai
Love this product! Simple and effective.,ai
"The product quality is decent; it's not top-tier but certainly not subpar either. It includes a single device, one tube, and the head is fairly simple to assemble. With  adjustable speed settings, it provides a more powerful, hygienic, and comfortable experience for managing various types of nasal discharge.",ai
"These little fixes really do work! I tend to keep my door wall open often, even during winter, which exposes my vertical blinds to a lot of breezes and winds. This has caused some slats to break, but these devices are great for fixing those broken slats in seconds. I recommend buying the ten-pack to have extras on hand for future use. It’s an excellent product.",ai
"The thickness is perfect, and they look great on my Nike Air Max . It's a shame they no longer sell these black ones here.",ai
"This product is completely unreliable. I've used multiple breathalyzers, and the best one I've found is the Alcohawk, which I bought locally for about $. This device showed a reading of 0.08 after five shots of Fireball, four Jägerbombs, and five beers in three hours. Given my weight of  lbs, the expected BAC should have been around 0., but this device showed a much lower reading. After testing it with just a shot of alcohol, it displayed a reading of 0., which is clearly inaccurate.",ai
"I used these spoons for a cooking competition. I didn’t win, but these spoons were definitely winners in my book!",ai
"I’ve been using Chessex dice for over  years, and they’ve always been well-made. I’ve seen reviews suggesting that the slightly rounded edges make some dice ""lucky"" or ""unlucky,"" but I haven’t experienced that myself. I highly recommend them.",ai
"I don’t wear much makeup, just simple eye shadow, blush, and highlighter, but I do need to clean my brushes. This tool has significantly reduced the time I spend cleaning my brushes, which is invaluable since I’m in college and don’t have much free time. It cleans the product off the brushes, and they can be used again immediately since they don’t stay wet.",ai
"As expected, the product arrived fresh, and the date was perfect.",ai
"It’s a shaver, not a plucker. It doesn’t remove hair from the root, which is what I was hoping for. I intended to return it, but I missed the return deadline.",ai
Excellent product! I was really impressed with how well it worked.,ai
I love these! The flavor is fun and enjoyable.,ai
"This is a great hard case for travel. It also has room to store extra pads, which is a nice bonus.",ai
"These glasses distort colors, making them uncomfortable for movie watching. They were also hard to adjust to, and I ultimately returned them.",ai
"They’re cheaply made. The product arrived bent because it was shipped in an envelope, which was disappointing.",ai
"This product works exactly as expected. It’s perfect for catching milk when pumping from one side at a time. It’s easy to clean, and delivery was fast.",ai
These are great for people with flat feet.,ai
"They work okay, but they aren’t exceptional.",ai
Great product! I’m very pleased with it.,ai
"These clippers are sturdy, sharp, and strong, but they’re a bit tight to use. I don’t have much strength in my hands, so they’re a little difficult for me.",ai
"It falls apart easily, but for the price, it’s not too bad.",ai
"The attachments are amazing! They’re made from comfortable materials, easy to clean, and they stay securely attached to the machine. Very happy with this product.",ai
"I used this for keto cornbread, and it worked perfectly. Just six drops gave the bread the taste of regular cornbread.",ai
"The scent is very light, almost too subtle for my liking.",ai
"Initially, I had high hopes for this bunion corrector. I waited a full year of consistent daily use before writing this review to see if there would be any noticeable improvements. While the product is easy to use and seems well-made, after a year of use, I’ve seen no progress at all with my bunion. A year should be sufficient to notice at least some change, but unfortunately, there has been none. I have decided to stop using it.",ai
"I placed this product in a low airflow area of my apartment, not far from the front door. I can definitely notice a reduction in pollen and dust in the air. My black glass furniture is now much easier to maintain, as I don’t need to dust it as often.",ai
"I highly recommend these wipes. They’re thick enough to remove eye makeup, but also gentle enough for other personal needs. I would gladly go out of my way to buy these again.",ai
"These are toddler-sized glasses, which is not what I expected based on the website description. Additionally, they arrived scratched, which was disappointing.",ai
"This pre-workout would be better suited for younger individuals or those not looking for something too potent. The texture is gritty, and I had to combine it with other supplements to achieve the desired effect.",ai
"This crimper is very easy to use, and the LED display is a nice touch, indicating when it's heated to the right temperature. It heats up to °C (°F), and it even comes with a glove to prevent burns. My hair is generally difficult to style, and it takes hours to curl with my regular curling iron. However, with this crimper, it only took about - minutes, and the waves lasted the entire day without needing hairspray. A great value, especially compared to my $ curling iron.",ai
"If I could, I would place a copy of this book in every home around the world. It’s a fascinating short story that opens your mind to the wonders around us. If you're open to new ideas, this book will be a source of joy and inspiration.",ai
"This is the second set of these items I’ve received, and both had damaged sound quality. The manufacturer seems to have serious quality control issues. I would only recommend these if you carefully inspect each piece before accepting them. Make sure to check every detail under a bright light and clean them thoroughly.",ai
"The latest reviews are the ones to pay attention to! This product definitely has a noticeable turmeric and ginger flavor, as those ingredients are included. It’s not flavorless by any means. While it blends well, I can’t think of many uses for it aside from curry, and I’m not particularly fond of curry. Ugh.",ai
"I love the compact size of this box. The design is beautiful, which is why I chose it initially. I can only fit one type of pill in it, but that’s fine since I take a lot of different pills anyway. It fits easily in my purse, pocket, or hand due to its compact design.",ai
"I’ve been on the lookout for a good magnesium powder for nightly use, and this one comes in a glass jar and is well-packaged. I was a bit disappointed that the jar was only about two-thirds full. The powder itself is easy to prepare, dissolving quickly in warm water and then adding cool water to drink. The flavor is neutral, without any overwhelming sweetness from stevia, which I appreciate. It’s effective at helping me relax at night. Overall, this is a pleasant, simple product, though I wish the jar had a bit more product inside.",ai
"I purchased this as a gift for my nephew, who has been struggling with depression and health issues. The black tourmaline is perfect for cleansing negative energy from his space and promoting healing. He really enjoyed arranging the branches and leaves to his liking. This is a great gift, and the black tourmaline itself is beautiful.",ai
"This product is easy to use and does the job well. I no longer spill detergent or make a mess when doing laundry. The product is compact (about the size of a deck of cards), and it dissolves quickly in the wash. The scent is mild, which I don’t mind. The tweezers and packaging are flimsy, but overall, I’m impressed with the soap itself. I’ll buy it again.",ai
"I bought this as a gag gift for a bachelor party, and it was immediately thrown in the trash. It was not at all what I expected and didn’t make for a good gift.",ai
"While I feel the price was a bit high for this product, it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I found a better price elsewhere, but overall, it worked perfectly.",ai
I will definitely use this product again.,ai
"The product works well, but it doesn't cover the area as instructed—it’s about - times less than recommended. I used it on my countertop instead of the floor, though, so that may be why.",ai
"It’s just a filter, but it works well. Fast shipping and a great price. The seller did a great job.",ai
The product was easy to use but didn’t deliver the results I was hoping for. Both my dentist and I couldn’t notice a difference after using the whitening products. My dentist recommended a product with trays that is actually working for me.,ai
The product does exactly what it claims.,ai
It ripped after just a couple of weeks of use.,ai
This product is perfect for red accents.,ai
"Cheaply made plastic. The trigger heads barely work, and the spray is very weak.",ai
This Chinese herbal supplement has been helpful for relieving my -year-old daughter’s allergy symptoms. We will definitely purchase it again.,ai
"This was the worst $ I’ve ever spent. The bow ribbon (which was supposed to be a string, according to the directions) kept getting stuck and eventually broke. I had to open each section manually, and by the time I finished, one of the eyelets was broken and the bow looked terrible. Additionally, the product was supposed to arrive on Sunday, but it came on Monday, just before I was about to surprise my daughter. Very disappointing.",ai
I’m not sure what to say about this item.,ai
Soft and breathable – the quality is excellent!,ai
Well-designed and perfect! I can't wait to hang this up for my mom’s 70th birthday. Thanks for helping make COVID- a little more bearable.,ai
"These halogen bulbs are becoming harder to find, so I’m glad I was able to get them. They work well, and I’ve stored the extras for future use.",ai
This looks great as a present for my daughter.,ai
"While I appreciate that it fits either hand, I wish it came in different sizes. It’s a bit snug, and the strap could be longer to accommodate different wrist sizes. That being said, it’s a good product for support and pain relief.",ai
"These pants work well for overnight diaper changes. They’re affordable and a great addition to my diaper supply. They’re not a perfect fit, but they cover enough to prevent leaks.",ai
These inserts were far too small for my size  feet. They’re also paper-thin. I’d recommend spending a little extra for better quality inserts like Odoreaters.,ai
These battery organizers are great! They prevent the batteries from rolling around and also help prevent power loss. The glow-in-the-dark version is especially helpful during power outages. My only complaint is the lack of variety in colors for better organization.,ai
These work great.,ai
You can buy a bottle twice the size of this for just $ at your local grocery store. Not a great deal on Amazon compared to the local price.,ai
"The product works as advertised, though it’s a bit challenging to stretch over deep dishes.",ai
"My mother had CDIFF, and this probiotic, along with others, was recommended. We’ve been very pleased with the results so far.",ai
"This product was terrible. It doesn’t get hot, doesn’t have a cord or charger, and is only usable as a doll toy. I tried to return it, but the shipper wouldn’t accept it. Very disappointing.",ai
"These earplugs are soft, flexible, and odor-free. They do an excellent job of blocking out unnecessary noise. I highly recommend them to others.",ai
"Ginger root helps with my stomach issues, and this brand was recommended by my doctor.",ai
"This light has effective clamps and provides bright white light. While I used to buy only Ott-Lite, I’ve found Verilux to be a great alternative.",ai
I love these! The colors are exactly as bright as I wanted.,ai
"I’ve tried several silicone loofahs in my search for a replacement for my classic pouf, and this one is by far the best. It’s not flimsy, the bristles are just the right length, and it cleans easily. The detachable handle reaches my back without issue. The battery lasts a long time, and it’s gentle on my sensitive skin. I’d recommend it if you’re looking for something similar. Wait for a sale to save some money.",ai
"This makes scrubbing my back so much easier! I wish I had this years ago. Now, I can scrub my own back without asking my wife to help.",ai
Holds hair well and effectively.,ai
"I've trusted Neosporin for years as my go-to antiseptic. I now use the ointment exclusively because the cream contains PEG, which I'm allergic to after testing in 2015. It's convenient to buy the -pack at this price due to ulcerations on my lower leg. Thank you for offering this on Amazon!",ai
"Excellent ingredient profile. Personally, I enjoy the taste—it reminds me of taking a few Flintstone chewable vitamins! The energy boost is smooth and lasts a good while without any jitters.",ai
"I feel improvement with every use. However, please consult your doctor for advice on the safe duration of neck stretching, as it's very important. 😎",ai
"Works effectively! The terry cloth surface absorbs more liquids, and it's easy to machine wash, though I prefer to air dry it. The crumb catcher at the bottom is a nice touch that can be used or omitted. The adjustable neck snaps are great for customizing the fit. Overall, a solid product!",ai
"Amazing product! After hearing about it from a fibro group, I decided to try it for my migraines. After using it more than  times over two weeks, it really helps with sleep and alleviates migraine pain. The print side is noticeably cooler. A tip: get two to avoid waiting for delivery as others suggested. It’s truly a life-saver!",ai
"I’ve been using this for years and it's fantastic! It prevents razor bumps and keeps my skin smooth and soft. A little goes a long way, making it a great value.",ai
"While the product worked well initially, it only lasted two weeks before it stopped functioning.",ai
Love the design—great style!,ai
This product exceeded our expectations! I highly recommend it to any friends or anyone searching for a high-quality product for their infants.,ai

I'm cured! I’m not sure if I’ll need to continue the supplement, but I’m reluctant to stop as I feel great now. Thank you, Suntory!",ai
"I’ve been struggling with bloating for a while and found this easy-to-swallow probiotic pill. Within a week of using it, my bloating reduced significantly and eventually disappeared. It’s a relief to find a product that works without the hassle of multiple pills!",ai
Exactly what I ordered. Great product!,ai
"I’ve always liked Herbalife products. They are a bit pricey, but the taste makes them worth it.",ai
"A thrilling murder mystery disrupts a girl's Sweet  party. The first two issues promise an intriguing story—murder, police work, conspiracy, and a hint of vigilante justice. Mia Goodwin’s narrative is shaping up to be an underground hit. Definitely one to watch.",ai

"Great fit! My son uses them for knee issues, and they offer good support.",ai
Perfect for gift wrapping candies for parties.,ai
"The product arrived on time. Although it felt a bit expensive, especially with shipping, I didn’t notice any significant difference from other protein drinks. It did upset my stomach, so I probably won’t reorder unless I find it in a store.",ai
"Amazing! I was looking for something similar to Shakeology, but this product has better ingredients and smaller serving sizes. The taste is surprisingly good! It's easily the best meal replacement I’ve tried, and the Aztec chocolate flavor is excellent!",ai

"Wow! I'm impressed by this game! The graphics are fantastic on PS3, and I can only imagine how much better it would be on PS4. The gameplay is smooth, realistic, and very easy to pick up. It works seamlessly on a US Playstation. I’m surprised this game wasn’t released in the US earlier.",ai
Super delicious and the individual serving packaging is so convenient. Highly recommend.,ai
"This seems more like a beard trimmer than a hair clipper. It's not as high quality as my previous Wahl trimmer, which had a more ergonomic design. However, it does cut well and is quieter. The guards are a bit stiff at first, but I think they’ll loosen up with use. It includes a USB charging cable, cleaning brush, and a velvet bag for storage.",ai
"Great product idea! I found this accessory at a good price. The full price is quite high, but the seller’s quick delivery made up for it. Excellent service!",ai

The tablets are very large.,ai
"I gave this four stars because I wish it were more affordable. It smells great and I enjoy it, but I’m looking for a better value.",ai
This works great for someone who takes many pills regularly.,ai
The lids are bulky and feel cheap. The small side is incredibly small and hard to clean by hand.,ai

"Had an issue with this product, but customer service was quick to resolve it. Thank you for the great support!",ai
These socks are very thick and uncomfortable to walk in. The gel inside made me feel unbalanced. I wouldn’t recommend them unless you want a dizzy feeling when walking.,ai
These are well-made and should last for many years.,ai
"My kids and I take this for fibromyalgia, along with a protocol. It has truly improved our lives.",ai
"Not exactly what I expected, but they’ll do.",ai

The previous product looked darker.,ai
These don’t keep water out of your ears and fall out easily.,ai
"In several studies with beagles and aging rats, cognitive ability improved with this supplement. I’ve been taking it for years, and Walmart no longer stocks it. Buying them separately is more expensive, and some sellers carry only one of the two. I hope Spring Valley continues to produce this product.",ai
"It’s good, but small.",ai
"A lovely synthetic shaving brush, well-packaged, and would make a great gift. It works well with bar soap for smooth shaving. I prefer it over badger hair brushes due to animal cruelty concerns. Highly recommend this brush!",ai

This product works great! One of my kids gained  pounds of muscle in just two months using this protein. The results are impressive!,ai
"This container, originally designed for pills, works perfectly for holding my Fitbit Alta tracker during pool aerobics. It effectively prevents leakage, so your pills should stay dry. The included chain is a useful feature, allowing it to be worn around the neck. Very satisfied with this purchase.",ai
"I purchased this product with the expectation of receiving an organic bubble bath, but the label does not support the organic claims made in the description. The labeling on the product itself does not mention anything about being organic. This is misleading, and the product does not meet the advertised expectations. I believe the description or labeling needs to be updated.",ai
Other brands offer higher quality than this one.,ai

Exactly what I was looking for!,ai
Perfectly suited for my needs.,ai
"These glasses are great, especially considering the price. The upper part of the lens is clear, and the designated reading area works well. Plus, they’re stylish, which is a bonus.",ai
"These are by far the lightest glasses I've owned in over  years of wearing glasses. The optics are sharp, and the design makes it easy to glance over the top of the lenses when needed. The lack of a rim around the top adds to the ease of use, similar to expensive progressive lenses. The only downside is the flimsy case, but that’s a minor issue. Highly recommend them.",ai
"These glasses fit my -year-old son perfectly. Though he needed some encouragement to use them consistently, they’ve held up well despite being dropped and sat on. They’re great for reducing eye strain from screens and even helped my son with headaches. I’ll be buying a pair for myself too.",ai
The product’s quality and packaging were disappointing. The package was incomplete and lacked two key attachments that were shown in the images.,ai
"I tried using this flat iron on dry hair, but it kept overheating, causing the light to turn red after just one section. I had to wait for it to reheat every time. The technology behind cordless flat irons seems to need improvement.",ai
Perfect for my business needs.,ai
"The labeling on this pill organizer is confusing. The compartments are in reverse order (evening first, then afternoon, and morning last), which can cause medication errors, especially for individuals with dementia. The product needs clearer labeling to avoid mistakes.",ai
"The shoes were advertised to fit size , but they feel smaller than expected. They are very soft and cushioned, though, just wish they were closer to the stated size.",ai
I absolutely love this product!,ai
Excellent product at a great price. Works very effectively.,ai
"The massager is great, although it occasionally shuts off randomly. It gets a lot of use, so it may be a minor flaw.",ai
This is a refreshing alternative to sugary drinks like soda. It’s perfect for cooling off on a hot day.,ai
"I needed this to make wearing my standard surgical mask more comfortable. Unfortunately, it wasn’t effective for me; it would likely work better for children as it helps keep the mask in place around the ears.",ai
This automotive radiator cleaner works as expected. I received six bottles and am satisfied with the results. A reliable product overall.,ai
"I’ve been using this product to help lower my bad cholesterol, and it seems to be effective.",ai

It’s important to remove the battery when not in use as it drains quickly.,ai

"I used these bags for filling items from a piñata. Unfortunately, the bags are of low quality and tore easily.",ai
"I purchased this product for wrinkle prevention after seeing it recommended on the Dr. Oz show. I mix it with face cream and apply it to targeted areas. While the product doesn’t sting, it has a very unpleasant odor. I cover it with a scented cream. I’m hopeful it will work over time, so I’m giving it a -star rating for now.",ai
"The product arrived on time, and I’m very happy with it.",ai
The quality is great for the price.,ai
"This was the cheapest option I could find, and it works very well.",ai
Works great on my fine hair! It’s easy to use and quick.,ai
"As a woman experiencing the early stages of menopause, I decided to try this product. It’s marketed as an upper region enhancement pill, but it also helps with menopausal symptoms. It’s a small, easy-to-swallow capsule that I take once a day. I’ve noticed a positive change in my cycle. I highly recommend this product!",ai
It lasts for two years in my high-mineral-content water. I highly recommend it.,ai
"I used to buy this when I lived in Japan, and I’m so happy I found it again on Amazon. It’s my favorite scent, and I can’t wait to buy more.",ai
I was disappointed with this item as it did not resemble the stone in the picture. The one I received was muddy brown and did not have the red hue shown in the ad. Not as expected.,ai
This gives me that extra energy boost I need during my workouts.,ai
