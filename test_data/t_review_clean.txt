so sad i return it coz im not comfortable to ride im heavybad experience when i returned charged me  a have to shoulder this money for three months so i can pay amazon im scared to buy now
cant use  much too large my fault  didnt know  20mm would be so large
i experienced vision loss and needed to cover up one of my eyes for the muscles to rest i was so tired of wearing a different eyepatch that was very rough and uncomfortable on my eyewhen i got these it was a noticeable difference in comfort these feel like silk on your eye even though my eye was protruding a little bit due to swelling they fit comfortably over it and allowed me to function i also liked that the strap around your head was not super tight i would definitely recommend these over the harder plastic ones
was hoping this would help with the pain in the ball of my foot but it ended up hurting me more from the elastic around the pad the pain from this overrode the pain in my foot and caused more pain for me very uncomfortable and will need to find something else what a waste of money
i would like to order a corn bag with more pockets  this is  a little shorter than i expected  i may contact seller to ask for a longer one  these are very easy to warm in microwave and comfortable to use
always liked this brush
wonderful pink floyd hat my husband loves it perfect fit thank you
great
best glass cleaner ever
my naturopath recommended this for me i put it in my morning smoothies and dont taste it at all
the brush heads dont last for long get a new brush with the attachments or get the brush heads made by aquasonic
this sleeve fits comfortably and provides plenty of support and compression to relieve my knee pain  ive tried others that were not nearly as comfortable
i like the longer length and i like the snap closure  i would have prefered the old fashioned ties but i do not like velcro so i take whatever i can get  lol the bibs are not absorbent much at all  they do protect my clothing
i really enjoy dripdrop when needed  i cant locate this product in my area so i order from drip drop through amazon  its purpose is to hydrate and  i think it works well
i just love these i had water dripping down my arms and now this is no longer a problem washing my face hair and hands doesnt require a change of clothes i gave one to a girlfriend and she just raves about them
we were given a jar of this i didnt even think to check amazon that it would be listed here none the less this works for usfor all that is mentioned on the jar in the future we will order from amazon as its cheaper on this site over ordering from the amish orgin site even the shipping is less toowe both have knee joint pain this works to relive the discomfort from arthritis most all of the other aches and pains we come to have with age we have also used this for colds and sore throats too
i added additional items to it  but they are so perfect  sturdy super light weight which i love 
i read some great reviews about this product before i purchased it honestly its the only reason i was comfortable trying the product i was excited to try it ive been searching for a solution for my snoring ive had several nasal surgeries and it has gotten pretty bad i must admitfirst it didnt fit in my nose maybe my nostrils are too close together im not sure but when i did get it to fit it was extremely uncomfortablefull disclosure i did not wear it to bed so im unsure if it would affect snoring or not sorry
they made my stomach very upset  the pills were very dusty and chalky
i really liked this product because you can use it on any jewelry  although i havent tried marcasite because of the liquid properties so i bought it again it is not chemical i believe and does not harm pearls or costume jewelry  fashion yet you can do gold and diamonds  i clean quite a bit of jewelry i still recommend a silver polishing cloth jewelry polishing cloth for most silver to keep the natural beauty of the oxidation or  tarnish that is sometimes intentionally put there this is very gentle on silver though unlike the dips and cleaners that strip away the beauty of the silver
the flavor and crunchiness is perfect the price is also excellent for these i will definitely order again  i have not found anything at the store that compares
it was just too complex for me to figure out how to do but just because i couldnt figure it out doesnt mean you wont i give it a rating of  stars
junk didnt even last a year before it just randomly stopped workingwont charge too bad i actually liked it until this
outstanding product if you have bp issues this will help you
ive already written reviews before on this product  stop asking for reviews  if i order it more than once it must at the very least be ok
great item
i very rarely wore sneakers or athletic shoes prior to the pandemic as no matter what brand i bought dr scholls etnies reebok skechers they hurt my feet i even tried gel inserts  nothing would helpi often and with great success wore flip flops i wore them at theme parks at a racetrack running errandsbut i still craved the security of a sneakeri decided to get these and thought theyd workthe biggest issue  no guidelines to cut the insert and for what theyre charging paying customers i got a complimentary review product  that is really unacceptable even the cheap dr scholls have guidelinesas far as comfort these inserts were a tad too stiff and rough with my feet already having issues  i didnt want to wait a good two weeks to see how well they worked then again due to the pandemic  that two weeks might be months as i dont go out i mostly due curbside drivethru or delivery for what i needgiven the mixed reviews  i dont think id get these again and i would caution against anyone i personally know purchasing them
absolutely didnt help or feel comfortable at all
over the course of a year ive purchased three different insoles with the main reason searching for  great arch support these insoles are by far the best ive found for that reason as a result of a back injury i developed a drop foot and have a fallen arch in my right foot these insoles help with that problem better than any ive purchased yet i will be buying more of these insoles now that ive found that they are the best for my situation
it works but it leaves a film
these are lightweight comfortable and flexiblethe perfect reading glassesi am disappointed that they are difficult to find
this product was very beneficial to me providing energy boost and decrease in physical pain i was experiencing great taste and convenient packaging
always leaves spots no matter how much i use  i dont like it but have to use the rest of it  wont purchase again
great idea wouldve given five stars if you could adjust size for the kids but keeps up w our goofy face masks
i use these for my prenatal vitamins i can tell such a huge difference with out them
smells great taste good works really well
product is above average but all kits should include a includes checklist  meaning that theres an inventory of things and an easy way to check off what has been used
its very cushioning however its very slippery it made my heels slip out with every step i take
love the size and convenience dont love that it shuts off randomly even when battery is charged
these are really good probiotics my gf has problems with acidreflux and i suggested this to her she felt improvement the first day she had tried one other of my probiotics which ive reviewed discounted purchase and didnt like the other brand made her feel constipated but she is a convert to the power pearls she forgot to take them for  days and her reflux symptoms returnedbest of the  weve tried and easy to swallow
not worth the money they are like cardboard
best dishwasher detergent on the market 
awesomeblocks out all sounds and so comfortablei dont even feel them in my ears
these bags rip open easily either when trying to open them to put them in the compost can or when taking them back out full of stuff we use them in a  gallon can so theyre not overfull
the electric brush works surprisingly well  and it does not burn hair or scalp  the minor design flaw is that when using it is easy to accidentally click on the optional mister  but typically a bit of mist is appreciated
it works
great for a quick stretch  exactly what i was looking for only thing i could say that is in the neighborhood of bad is that i had to go out and buy eye hole screws  not a biggie in no way was a surprise and in no way affects the product or its listing
tasty refreshing fun no stevia aftertastei am really enjoying the orange flavor it reminds me of tang just bought blue raspberry to try tooi eat keto and find these drinks useful am using the mixed drink to make popsicles granitaand gelatin squares too
it works
transaction and product were perfect
if youre trying to turn your sink into a jackson pollock painting its great not so much for teeth

i got it for my mother in law and my self we loved it because its long and our sleeves dont get wet and its comfortable
ginseng has delivered several beneficial results morning sickness pickled ginseng from the grocery refrigerated section and supplements keep it at bay monotonous low energy ginsengginsenosides are a natural steroid group exclusive to the panax genus of ginseng it acts as an antiinflammatory  concentrations are natural in panax  would be a 3x concentrationalways reliable nice value seems like a quality source
the idea of being able to hang the readers on my neck without a chain caught my attention and this feature works really well i also love that these readers are blue light blocking great value for quality
these are great  we use them in a ceiling fan  they are standard base and are dimmable
i like this memory book  its got all the pages id hoped for and its really cute  the only drawback is that it begins to look full and bulging when items are added  for instance ive added ticket stubs photos etc and its now big  my daughter is only four months old and its already looking overfilled  i actually dont mind much but if youre wanting a pristinelooking baby book and want to add items and mementos youre probably better off doing an actual scrapbook
i thought these bands were elastic it is difficult to put it on alone as sometimes the metal part hits the mask where the earloop starts and may snap off the earloop once on they do increase the sealing of the kn95 mask
this stuff lasts forever best part is you can refill the bottles too
collagen is a fantastic supplement for so many reasons its great for your hair skin nails gut immune system and more this powder is super easy to incorporate into your diet my favorite way to take it is to blend it into my morning protein smoothie it virtually disappears and youd have no idea it was even there you can also add it to both hot and cold drinks sprinkle it on your yogurt add it to soup bake with it etc its super easy to sneak into almost anything this powder is nice and fine and seems to be nice quality this is a little more expensive than other varieties ive seen though usually you can get a 1lb tub of collagen powder for about the same price as this and this is only  ounces so its not the best deal but it does seem to be good quality
good product but the color of pills is different from the last bottle i got not sure why
perfect little shovels as they are called in our house thank you for a good product
best non greasy sun protection spray easy to apply and effective though expensive
these did not pop no matter what the kids tried  they do have the strongest suction cups ever so the kids had great fun sticking it to their faces and bodies
from performance to quality to color i like themthank you
it works in combination with other herbs i have managed to get hold of in my own country so very pleased
it sucks that this doesnt suck enough to be effective im so disappointed and itchy
i love it and have used it all over house and in car battery doesnt last as long as stated but several uses for sure great item
this ice bag is both functional  cute  i got one for myself plus one for a girlfriend who loved it  the size is a little smaller than i expected judging from the picture but for a runner its the perfect size to fit on a sore knee
i hate wasting money on supplements wondering if they are doing anything at all  with 17hd you can feel it working in about  minutes  it is amazing  my workouts are truly intense and it is hard to leave the gym  i highly recommend this product
this wig has nappy roots its really poofy and the hair quality is very poor it looked nothing like the picture i would hope that my wig was just a defect and you receive a product that youre satisfied with not happy
i use it on my neck where i have some bone deterioration  wow it really feels good  and the relief from the discomfort in my neck lasts for at least a day and sometimes longer  
got the right stuff on time in a right package
this is a great product if you do not have pets or lint in your home not good for people with pets or lots of hairs laying around it is a magnet that is hard to keep clean and fresh looking otherwise extremely comfortable and functional
this is a product ive used for the last 8years its a very good product and was delivered right on time please continue this product i would like to see the packages come in  ct and kind of case price for the amount of clothes in the futurethank youshelly r
aside from making you run to the bathroom all the time and your insides hurt you gain weight instead of losing it
these were ok served the purpose okay but not great
product is super close to expiration date not acceptable specially for a product that is for babies additionally seller did not even bother to answer my message dont buy anything from this seller
purchased for my two nephews they are delighted with the fizzies at bath time
makes mom feel special in the nursing home
bought it for the girlfriend and she absolutely loved it this is the bag we use when we go to bingo we have had so many compliments
2nd unit we purchased we run it   days we change filter more often than they recommend complete filter kits are around  plus shipping of  excellent filtration very quiet new unit has additional features
have been to hatch they live peppershatch peppers are more than a notch above
this is my 2nd talley amp twine watch great watch i would give it  stars if it included the date i work in a classified office and my cell phone can  not enter i sometimes forget the date getting old  great watch for the price i added what i would call a classier leather band the band that came with the watch was too long for me
perfect i put one in my book bag purse car etc ehrn need it its there
awesome for cleaning my sewing machine
great scale
this product was exactly as described and performed perfectly in cleaning coins easy and safe to use and without a doubt the best i have seen in a long time will certainly buy again
but it only have usb charging which is a downfall
the back brace works great if you need to do work around the house it definitely gives you full support for your back i like how you can adjust the shoulders to fit you properly and around the belly also i wear mine over a light tshirt and then put another shirt on top of it when going out of the house around the house i just put it on over my clothes and it works great either way
this was perfect  keeping it for all future eids
do not saw significant effect after whole bottlefor this pricedo not recommend
very happy with this purchase dealer condition of item just as described hope to do business again
i liked that theyre transparent so i can see just how much water is in them they dont leak and retain heat pretty well would buy again but they seem well made and i dont expect to have to
it has thumb prints allover with strands of hair
only  minutes run timeneeded hours
im glad i found this frames for my  year old son it is cheaper from the optalmologist store
i purchased these glasses because i liked the style and the price seemed reasonable and because it has become increasingly difficult to find nonprescription reader bifocals in stores like walmart my major beef with these glasses is that they regularly need to be tightened upthe little nuts holding them together keep loosening up and i have to use a pair of needlenosed pliers on them almost every day
the chain broke within the first  hours of wearing it   the locket itself is cute and seems to be made well its a shame
wasnt as much in the bag for the price paid
product wasnt  percent what i expected but sufficient
not so rough i want coarse
i am a teacher and bought these for my kids teachers after i received one of my own i love this i use it more than i thought i would and its so nice to have all these emergency items on hand because there is no downtime in the classroom love it
seemed to really help my adrenal fatigue
little pricey but t the worst thing is that it burned out in two weeks  i used it in my bandsaw 
love it the scent is perfect and the product truly performs better than expected
got it yesterday i am so delighted with this product i have kind of fine hair after my hair was washed and dried within minutes as a first time user my hair looked professionally done totally excellent certainly worth the money i am usually not handy with my kinky curly hair and i dread washing as i will have to fix it again to look presentable i would give this a  star if i could
perfect size leaves residue on hands after handling
the inserts dont cover the entire sole of the shoe so the middle of my feet feel like theyre on hard jelly with nothing padding the rest of my foot
these worked very well for my nighttime comfort  they dont fall out like my previous pair and they are easy to put in and take out
the hair was ok a bit larger than i needed puff sizes wouldve been great
have only been taking it for a few days so no real results as yet but am willing to give more after a few weeks  my only complaint is that there is only an half a bottle of pills in these larger bottles why  i combined the two bottles into one but such a waste of packaging really pisses me off theres just no reason for that
these stickers smell for a few moments  alas with the end of the matte scratch and sniff sticker the era of a longlasting smelling sticker has ended  these stickers do contain a scent but the scents so ethereal last but a few fleeting moments and not unlike the thunder once you comment about it it has already ended these stickers lose their scents quicklyshipping was a little high as well
i have no idea how to use this theres no power button on the curler or any indicator on where to turn it on the box it came in was a little smashed but the rest of the things are okay
this glasses are for women only and they are pretty small
this body wash smells wonderful the foam makes it feel luxurious too
the corner smart bath basket is wonderful  i found it extremely easy to install and there is no sticky residue to deal withwhen i first tried to install it i couldnt get it to stay put so i resorted to reading the directions  you must clean your shower with soap i used palmolive dishwashing liquid then rinsed and dried the area  after that there was absolutely no problem  the basket has been in place with shampoo on it for  weeks now without any problems  i would recommend this product to anyone
like this scent slot
cute and well made
love it
dont fall for the false advertising
good product add it to my yogurt
great gag gift sure to upset all the other siblings
this does the job
i have seen these at peoples houses and got mixed reviews not this brand just this product and i have seen them all over the internet for sale wouldhave killed for one of these in my teenage years but i will be honest i didnt expect itto really work i mean the concept seemed sound but what i thought to be common sense would tell you if it could pull a blackhead from under your skin it would pull to hard to not damageyour skin well common sense somehow got put to the side on this one bc i will tell you and everyone including my mom if she asked this thing is fully legit luckily my skin these days isnt just screaming with issues but for the first time in my life i was over the moon when i saw i had a blackhead i pulled this sucker out and centered it over the spot and turned it on i prob should have stayed on low but i clicked on the highest and i didnt think it did anything significant felt the tug on my skin but clicked it right back off and looked at the little pad and saw this stuff in there and looked at my face there was a ring that went away after like a minute and that sucker was all the way gone it was amazing i will vouch for this thing all day never bought anything that worked this good so fast amazing
cheap quality plastic toy not worth it ive been using it exactly as directed twice a day since i purchased it and have seen zero resultsi dont recommend it
these are likely expired product description states per gmp guidelines set forth by the fda most products are formulated for  months from the date of manufacture liquids and probiotics are formulated for  monthswhat i received has a manufactured date of september 2016 today is november 14th 2018 these were ordered directly from swanson
my son liked it and it helps safety habits while promoting first aid enough room to add more stuff
its narrower than expected served my purpose well though
didnt notice any significant changes in my appetite
misleading natural armor essential oils do not have organic certification simply saying they are organic does not make it so the company response to my query was if you dont feel comfortable with our company or our products simply do not purchase them buyer beware if you truly want organic
i carry one in my backpack and clean between my teeth after meals it is so much gentler than using a toothpick and even gentler than using dental floss i love the taste of the productit refreshes your mouth after a meal the fact that they help maintain tooth whitening is a huge bonus as well especially because of how the brush gently squeezes between your teeth
i have really been enjoying these mine came very moist  maybe even too moist in one of the tubes and the toothpicks were very weak at first after you open a tube the first time they stay moist but dry enough to harden a bit though they still wont be the most durablethe green flavor is a very different sweet spearmint but i ended up really growing fond of it nice for when you dont want a full on energy drink but need a little pick me up
this stone has a fair claritynot great but an amazing energy  this is one of the most energetic and uplifting stones i have encountered  if you are a crystalworker i recommend this wholeheartedlythis stone also pairs wonderfully with angelite
convenient and easy to use
these toothpicks are the shape and size i wanted and they are sturdy
really good shakey heads work well
these insoles are comfortable but too narrow for my shoe which is size  d the width of the insole is  at the widest part that leaves a total gap of about half an inch between the insole and the sides of the shoe
it helps my knees
they do the trick dont get me wrong however i notice some differences in these compared to the original one that came with the pari nebulizer first they are misshapen and kind of flat i figured over time and use they would get their round shape back but they havent also my daughter started to develop a little rash on both sides of her face just outside of her mouth exactly where the plastic touches  that never happened with months of use with the original
three stars for giving a replacement and wearing fairly comfortable but i like my new dockers betterrarely have i any difficulty with sellers that go through amazon i guess it does happen this time i received defectiivedamaged items jimarti guarantees a no questions asked prompt replacement unfortunately this was not the case trying to repeatedly send emails with delayed response finally i got the replacement quite honestly these sunglasses are nothing to write home to mamma about as the saying goes all in all i am fairly satisfied and they wear comfortably numb i wish they would have provided a self return paid label gladly return the first ones even though they do have a nice selection i would not rely on this seller for sunglasses again no questions asked defective item policy hmm oh yeah we get lemons x funky merchant emails to boot  maybe we all are having a blonde hair day lolps i wound up buying dockers sunglasses at a little higher price with another merchant with prompt delivery i am happy 
works well but way too expensive these are not expensive ingredients ginkgo pea hcl and caffeine was willing to pay  per pill even though thats still a lot for these ingredients at over  per pill  no thanks
arrived with  of the prongs already having fallen out the ones that remained in the device scratched my skin they were not sanded properly and were not smooth dont buy this item buy higher quality
the brush heads are too soft it is not meant for adults but for little kidstoddlersnot worth the money so i returned mine
very legit
im allergic to nsaids so i used this product for its antiflamitory and wound care after my dog bit me and it worked great  it also smells good which in my book is a plus  there are so many essential oils out there that smell bad and that actually give me migraines because they smell so bad  but this one doesnt do that so its nice to come across ones that actually smell good  i looked it up and discovered that rosewood does other great things like helps with depression and boosts the immune system  it can help the skin if you have sensitive or dry or oily skin  it can also help as a nasal decongestant  it works as a insect repellent which is great cause i dont like bugs and it can be used as a perfume  so its another essiential oil that has multiple purposes  i highly recommend this product
purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder  it is less messy than regular powder however it doesnt work as well  and it is oddly greasy  he reports that it is lotiony in a weird way  since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry  if its lotiony or greasy not so muchif youre hoping for a replacement for powder  this isnt it  at least in my husbands opinion
bought to protect comics and thats what they do best dont forget the backboards and scotch tape
this house is very well made everything is rounded and no rough surfaces real wood and smells very nice the bottom is removable and not needed for hamsters my hamster loves sleeping in this house and chewing it many thanks to the seller for excellent product good price and fast delivery
good quality and work as well as name brand
let me put it this way if i need another one i will save myself the search that went into this one for example this thing was way cheaper then similar ones and was the only one in its price range that had all of these features
lovely fragrance and helps with pain control
a little more cutesy in the decoration than i entirely like but the fleece is lovely the water bottle is sturdy enough and kept my bed warm all through the night and into the day
this is 6th pair of eyekeppers im a loyal customer great value comfortable and beautiful the computer tint is perfect for work and just everyday use
as soon as i attempted to insert a lock cylinder into the top hole and tighten down with the thumbscrews the unusual alignment of the thumbscrewswerent pointed directly at the side of the cylinder kept causing the lock to twist and the thumbscrews kept slipping off the bottom of the lock the plastic ring that reduces the hole size then cracked i didnt even tighten the screws that tight i ended up using a piece of leather as a shim to hold the lock cylinder in place this is a kwickset lock cylinder and is the most common size too much work to set a cylinder
i ve tried other brands this one does good brushing and clean my teeth one tablet is a little too spare two are perfect wish the peppermint is stronger though easy to use and appreciated its friendly packaging
didnt seem to do anything for me
good enough for kids to play
this product supports my digestion very well
update at bottomi like that it heats up fast the size covers my entire back and heeling properties from the hot stones its much better than any regular heating pad the plug could be in a better position other than that i love it updated 21222 loved it until i plugged it in yesterday morning and it didnt heat up and it worked fine the day before i broke my neck and back i use a heating pad most mornings to loosen my muscles and joints so i can move it didnt get used everyday mainly since it got cold only had it for almost  months disappointed i have to spend more money on another heating pad and most likely wont get my money back for this not happy
nice tea good quality i would order this again
i purchased the mop and bucket and tried to use the refill mop heads and these dont fit my mop head
i love that tyhis product is natural and contains miswak and olives

my husband needed this for a necknerve problem and its been helping a lot  he is so much better
dont waste your money just buy some apple cider vinegar it works much better
useless the spring is bigger and coarser than other brands ive tried and didnt even epilate  i felt nothing pulling or epilating when i used it but did when i  immediately tried  my older wand from another company  i threw these  away  thankfully they were not expensive  ive learned bellabe is worth the extra money
great bulk price  cant seem to find this scent in stores anymore so amazon is my go to  arrived as described
no idea what floral and zesty is supposed to smell like the scent is strong but pleasant and it fills my bathroom and bedroom well and its not terrible and way better than cat box smell just wish it said what im supposed to be smelling because my nose is confused
see above comments
delicious and healthy
we bought this ladder  years ago and it is the best investment i have ever made light and easy to move and can be stored anywhere simply the best step ladder on the market
i really like this pillbox  its large enough to fit many pills in each slot  it stays closed  clock didnt work at first however a coke got spilled on it and suddenly the clock started working  ha ha the pills remained dry  i definitely would buy this again
this was the first product that i purchased from this brand and i always have it in my house melatonin is not my jam but this supplement totally is not only does it taste like graham crackers and childhood christmas but it actually works my joints definitely let me know how unhappy they are in the morning if i didnt have this the night before i dont go to sleep without it buy it
to curl my lashes
promptly sent and received  it was exactly as described
this smells wonderful but the scent does not last  the wax only lasted for the day and the laundry detergent smelled great but didnt last  you can tell this is a knockoff of the original  im not bashing it but you get what you pay for 
as far as removing old steps  this thing sucks  unless you are only going to use this on new steps get something else  the opening in the socket is too small any older steps with rust and bends on them will constantly get jammed inside this bit unless you want a future filled with hammering steps out of this socket move on  i suggest trying the pole step driver from reliable instead and i am a huge huge  milwaukee fan  this driver bit needs a redesign  sorry milwaukee but its the truthas far as this new lime green model goes we stumbled onto one of our newer guys called gogo mounting it into a hammer drill instead of the impact  he swears the in and out motion works a lot better than just spinning in the seated position
very nice heavy bags
nice and stretchy good amount of adhesive
this is my second time buying irish sea moss the first go round was a definite bust not even knowing about it it had a terrible chemical smell it was moist and rubbery plus the color was very pale this irish moss however upon opening a very pleasant smell the bag is stuffed and its not covered in unnatural salt i soaked a pinch of  it for only  minutes and it expanded so big i had to add more water havent blended it yet but im confident that it will hell perfectly i recommend this thank you
sucked quality heat  all of it
good quality very thick
ive been using bonapel for  months and am very happy with results my tummy looks firmer and those baggy arms looking toned i love the dimples on my face however the ones on my butthad to go working great for that problem area use prior to workouts which i think my enhance the results
awesome product i love it
will not adjust to the opening of the tub
the clippers are great i like the longer handles and the nail storage area
the picture is a little prettier but this is a very nice sized and uniquely shaped stone the only thing i didnt like is the hints of brown in the stone but there wasnt enough of it to ruin the overall look of the stone this is my secobd purchase from this seller and would buy again  nice that they include a small free gift
very cute perfect to use as santa bags in a sleigh for decoration
the perfect supplement for a diabetic
really cute and everything came in great condition
these are us    they work the same but they are not as soft as the originals  it keeps them from bunching up in heels  they arent as comfortable they feel like a recycled plastic cloth product im thinking of putting thin liner socks over them  but its great having a thin option again  even if i had to order it from the uk  they arrived quickly though so dont worry about the long date they give i got mine within a week
cool little lighter set had to fiddle with the plug for a second before it starts charging but once the light comes on it will stay charging
like optiks sunglasses good lenses these were not as comfortable as some others i have so  star
the scrubber is great quality and easy to use i am a rather small flexible human who doesnt have any issues situating the scrubber in order to scrub my back however im sure those with low flexibility or a large backshoulders could still have some issues the scrubber did come out of the package with a very strong perfume smell thats rather nauseating however it does fade considerably over a few washes
wow i love this reading glasses its the best reading glasses ive ever bought it fits perfect like i was measured light weight and i dont even feel it in my face it also holds up in place when moving my head im going to buy more other colors too
not as pliable as i expected
nice but love the lemon scent better
dislike the fact that first time using the handle broke off
this product works just as expected  i will purchase it again soon  if you use tape of glue with your lace front this is a good one to try
i started taking floraq after my gi doctor recommended it two years ago  i had a history of diverticulitis attacks and ibs which i am now basically free of  i dont know how much floraq has contributed to my health but i wouldnt give it up despite the cost which is rather high
i do not like that it has a  degree angle because it is painful when putting in and taking out
this is a great alternative to medications if you need something to calm you  it really does work quickly with no side effects
not good for shorter hair curling iron says to hold the heating mechanism away from face but then it doesnt curl your hair at all and when you hold the heat towards your face it works better but still doesnt make a full curl for how much i spent on this i would expect it to have better results
love it
great product but if you shop around you can get comparable products for less money
omg this thing is amazing and i love itworks great 
i was very impressed with this product as i have never used anything like this before the balls were comfortable packaged discreetly and very easy to clean i think its best with you start with the smallest and work your way up to the biggest one i liked how comfortable they were as well totally recommended
i have bought these before  they fit just like the other ones did  they stay on tight and does not loose up  great product and great service
stopped working just after the return window expired very disappointededit seller contacted me after original review was left and offered a replacement or refund i opted for a replacement item and im glad i did ive had the replacement for several months and its working very well thank you great customer service from the seller
great bags and good size bought them for a craft market
too short and the scrubbers on the side dont hold soap  needs to be at least a foot longer to make it easier to use  not worth the money back brush works easier  dont waste your money on these
came fast and works fine with my facial cleaner i bought from walmart
gorgeous scent lasts through the day
great pump so easy to use and has very strong suction features and modes love the fact that its made differently than other wearable pumps and it doesnt make your boob look weird its very natural looking so far i havent found anything i disliked i will definitely be adding this to my pumping routine
my wife had a severe burn from boiling liquid this product was absolutely outstanding in protecting the area its now healed
there is nothing actually wrong with the product it does exactly like its supposed to i just hate knee scooters in fact i used it one time and i havent used in since
the rv repair place where we had a new floor installed left a can of this in our rv  they said it would remove any kind of stain from anything  they are right  i use this product on grease stains on my husbands clothes and to clean up the grease spots on my black kitchen appliances it doesnt have a really heavy petroleum smell like bug  tar remover that i have used for these jobs before  i havent used it on my carpet yet but im sure i will  is plenty to pay for sure but a little of this goes a long way
this really works to squeeze out the last drop of any tube i use primarily with tubes of paint and only flaw is that sometimes the tube will split i wish you could adjust the level of squeeze a bit
easy to use i have developed warm feelingsfor this product
i just received this item and i hadnt even tried it on but i could tell from the feel of it i made an excellent choice if you need a head strap for plastic frames that slide down your nose as mine always do get this product it is even better than i had hoped the strap is very lightweight you wont even know you have it on i wear behindtheear hearing aids  the pieces that attach to my frames are very thin and pliable and fit nicely in my crowded ear space the part that goes behind your head has a velcro fastener with the very cool company name on it the strap sits low on my neck and is hardly noticeable even with a shaved head this strap is well worth your money and will do the job perfectly the only available color is black  i would have preferred some other  but because of how well it works i can easily overlook the matter order today
cheap price but not good it doesnt hold the syringe securely the medicool ones which are priced high work much better you get what you pay for
great came with zip up case and soft case  lens cloth
toothbrush heads are super
i love it they are perfect fit and as described are helpful
im considering palram roof panels for a shed im planning to build but thought id give them a trial run on a dog house first with a simple gabled roof the ridge was the perfect finishing touch they are pricey for what youre getting a  section when an  panel is half the price
how much do i love this flat iron so much that i bought a second one for my daughter less than a week after i purchased one for me this flat iron heats up so fast after the first use i only heat to  it was that hot and the brush style bristles get hot too for an almost single pass through to achieve results it gave us straight yet bouncy sleek hair my daughter and i have super thick wavy hair and the heated teeth get every side of the hair was we pull through every time be sure your hair is brushed prior to using as the teeth will snag a knot i wish it had protective steam like my last one but with a lower temp it hasnt damaged my hair yet love this and highly recommend
cool no smell but you can use it as a car accessory
awful way too small i have a very large member but this feels awful and is very small not worth it 
love it
great product works well
absolutely as shown in the picture arrived  weeks early packed well no damages loved it
bought this for my  year old mother who was using a traditional four leg walker she was getting slower and stiffer now with the winnie golite she can move more freely and easily navigate anywhere the breaking system is secure and she can operate it even with very arthritic hands
you can do much much better for this price  however i can get a decent shave from it if i need  workmanship is cheeeap there are flaws and uneven surfaces  it is on the aggressive side but it gets the job done  it will test your skills  i cant say i recommend it
fun design that went with out tie dye theme but the bags were really thin and they ripped easily
made my work day pain free and nighttime leg cramps almost disappear
this works great purchased for my autistic sonhis grandpa made a platform for it based on the one found on wwwautismfrogcom under the dyi bubble column platform link i was able to purchase the wood for it in the value wood section at menards ours came with the colored balls not the fish we are happy with it regardless there were no directions but you just fill it with water to the max line add the balls or fish plug it in and switch it at the bottom of the base we plan to eventually add the nonbreakable mirrors as shown on autismfrogcom as well
poor quality doesnt stay where you put it
excellent quality for an affordable price comfortable and looks great very happy
videoid8029a0208501abe359ec1ebab525d10b i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review i was not influenced by anyone in any way of my opinion of this productthis exfoliating hand and back loofah has a soft terry cloth material they are not too harsh this back scrubber is about  inches shorter than the one i just got and about   inch less in width the rope handle on this one is also thinner than one i just got but these still do the jobi love fact that i can reach my back without hurting myself both of my rotary cuffs are ripped so these really come in handy these are great for both men women and children my grand daughter is 8yo and she likes to use them these help take off the dead skin for better cleaner skin taking off the dead skin also helps so you dont break outanother great idea to use the back scrubber lotion can never get that middle part of your back just dad a little lotion in the middle and use the back scrubber to apply the lotion i do this all the time
there is nothing like a new clipper blade been grooming dogs for years and i found this blade set worked great for me much better price than the brand name but works just as well these are nicely packed super fast shipping fits my andis and a5 oysters clipper perfectly fits all my  guard combs perfectly these are very sharp professionalgrade blades the blade cut smooths and even without leaving any cut lines i prefer this type of metal blade as it can be sharpened overall they work great and would recommend them
constantly shuts off doesnt work well
these bags are sturdy and can be used after the gift is taken out as an overnight bag for children  double duty

its a great product we think it is better than miralax arrived  day early thanks amazon for going over and above to carry great products
i like watermelon taste but this one seems a little bit too much you should probably dissolve a portion in a gallon of water to have a good taste overall
i love it this product has helped restore my dry ends i use it 2xs a week a little goes a long way not heavy at all and smells good
good  arrived timely in good shape and as described
great value for the

i get nauseous every time i take one i have taken other probiotics and this has never happened before i have tried drinking lots of water but i still feel nauseous all day
toothbrush head wears out quickly battery lasts very long between charging i guees thats why  heads comes in the pack 
these are very awkward they need to be constantly molded  and are very stiff not worth the money sending back
cute quality product
stylish glassses that give me sharp vision
one pair actually went too far into my ear was able to get it out with tweezer the bigger set does not block out most noise
the baby shower recipient was very happy with this product because it had it all a place for guests to sign and put their addresses a place to write the gifts received a place for photos a place for babys first year milestones and photos it even came with a pen great gift idea for a shower
if you are an average male this is way too large it wont stay on  at all
they all meet my need and help keep my gum healthy and clean i use them almost every single day
worked great and as advertised
cant beat the price
they were what they were supposed to beyou dont always get that so its saying a lot in a simple way
unless your vehicle is dirty these are not what you want to use  light dust and water spots and these are very good  i have gone through about  boxes of these  i have not yet tried the wax wipes  i suspect they wont replace a good wax job but will most likely be good for between 
quality
beautiful pattern love the square shape and seem a little sturdier than many paper plates  nice that there are matching napkins and cups too
i received my bracelet a couple of days ago and am pleased with it it fits well is obviously a medical id bracelet that all medical personnel will instantly recognize and the builtin software is basic but serviceabledownsides if you are a large person with a bigger than normal wrist this bracelet might be too small for you i am a pound male and it fits me perfectly however i know some people with bigger wrists who might have problemsthe included software is a bit basic but seems to do the job it has no builtin printing capability but i found it is easy to print take a screenshot and print that that takes a second or two and it works well id prefer builtin printing but this work around is simple and suffices i suspect that all medical personnel and most everyone else can figure it out in a second or two then again there isnt all that much information im not sure anyone will really need to print iti also copied a text file to the jump drive called emergency  read metxt that duplicates most of the information i entered into the bracelets id and then i added quite a bit more info besides i gave the names and phone numbers of several next of kin in case the two listed in the bracelets software were both unavailable i also added information about my medical insurance car insurance i am guessing this could be useful after an auto accident and everything else i could think of the emergency  read metxt file is easily printedi am keeping the bracelet and plan to wear it all the time
this thing is amazing it feels better on your scalp than you can put into words i have a really dry but simultaneously insanely oily scalp the result is that my scalp is always crazy itchy while my hair gets super oily really quickly its a nightmare since using this and other brushes like these the itchiness has calmed down significantly and im able to spread my natural oils through my hair more evenly to prolong the time between washes this is also amazing for deep conditionershair masks because it just really works the product in and moisturizes the scalpi have tried several brushes like these but this one is by far my favorite because it is silicone all the way through vs plastic handle which just makes it easier and more comfortable to maneuver also because the tips provide a deeper more comfortable massage than the brushes with solid tipsi love that you can use it on wet or dry hair this is honestly such a great product that i wish i had been using for years past
this product is amazing for cleaning the boat it gets off any pesky spots and makes getting those tough spots clean a breeze we will never use anything else
very poor communication with seller waited for product in the mail never came over several weeks  contacted seller and finally sent product  would not order from them again  pillows okay they are stuffed will small light weight pellets not the most comfortable after breast surgery  i believe a softer material for fill in the pillows would be more comfortable
soft and keeps me dry i live in a tropical climate smells great and does keep my clothes free from white marks
works
hard to swallowthe pills are not big but are not coated
does it job nicely
amazon wont let me cuss in my review but trust me i would love to cuss up a stormi wish i could call the better business buerau of china and make someone improve this product brand new arrays stop working ridiculously quick some didnt work at all i have one left and feel like i might as well throw it away as well these are supposed to work at least  hours if you keep the machine at  amps max good luck getting through  hour with it functioning my 9th one stopped working after  minutes  i think maybe two of them worked as much as  hoursvery much a waste of money where are the good arrays please someone tell me where to buy a functional product i love my ionic detox machine i hate how hard it is to find quality arrays zinger electronics i just left a  star review for the arm straps you sold me because they were the first to actually fit the socket but now im wondering if that might be defective tooi was really looking forward to getting my complete detox on this february now im back spending time and money praying to find a decent producttotal waste of plastic metal energy and money i feel so bad throwing these in the trash even if recyclable total waste
sturdy tools nice hard case with built in mirror

i am very satisfied with this kaywoodie rusticated bulldog styled pipe elegant design and fits comfortably in your hand cant beat it for the price as i have recently preferred kaywoodie over the dr grabow line of the entry level tobacco pipes it was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner
love this product it really works
great nail dryer
this product is worthless this back scrubber would only be suitable for a  year old boy or girl this is not even close to being suitable for an adult with an adult back and an adult body this is way to short like a childs tinker toy you have been warned look else where
the most popular ball at our lunchtime pickup game  plays better than oo balls  holds up well to astroturf  you can pound it and it doesnt hurt your feet
i really like being able to soak my bite guard in this container good quality
this does not work at all dont buy barley heats up 
not worth the money  i was looking for disposable dishcloths not just the old handiwipes from the 1970s  these were costly and basically just junk maybe good for a mechanic checking the oil dip stick
okay that just dont work at all ive tried them several times cause i thought maybe i was doing it wrong but they just dont catch any hair whatsoever i wouldnt buy it not worth it
tastes like chemicals
i am vegetarian since birth finding non fishmeat based products is difficult this one worked fine for my needsi ordered several months worth to save waiting for delivery product sent and received as promised
perfect size for everything when traveling  i especially like the back pocket that slips over the handle of my luggage with wheels

perfect

i was a little skeptical but ive used this after overdoing a run and even for a sinus headache that neither naproxen or ibuprofen relieved it really works well and doesnt upset my stomach
love it 
taste gross but does give you a lil boost of energy i used it right before a run or workut

i took these on a vacation to costa rica rain forest and also to alaska  they are very convenient to use and worked
i got half of my order but so glad i got a refund the rolls are very small and not soft
my husband and son prefer wearing the disposable masks whereas my daughter and i like the cloth ones after months and months of wearing the blue disposable ones my son was actually pleased to have a different color these are more of a dark grey than black but its something different the mask quality seems to be comparable to other disposable masks one thing that i really like is that these are packaged in small quantities so theyre more likely to stay sterile until use
it doesnt do much yes it foams and vibrates a little but certainly doesnt exfoliate returned
hoped to feel better  maybe more time needed
i wouldnt have believed it if i didnt try it myselfit works  butit is temporaryget the adhesive spray as well for knees elbows joint areas that will stretch the tape
i purchased this for my fur baby  so far hes not scared of the little sound it makes great buy
very disappointed bottle was not full box looked as if it had been on a shelf for years next purchase will be direct
these batteries last long charge well and i think theyre better than the bunnycopper brands by far

cant put my left sock on after back fusion this is a god send
easy to assemble very cute
i so wanted these to fit my existing blow dryer but  they didnt
expiration date was  years prior
the repositioning of the hose attachment is an excellent design i wish it was quieter though
this product was fantastic it had all the right ingredients and so far it has helped me immensely
good product
thank you 
no more kidney stones in two years  worth a thousand doctors
the parts fit the lactina pump at work
we use this for a dogs very complicated medication regimen  makes it easy when two of us are involved in dosing and we know exactly whats been given and what needs to be given  convenient to set out a whole weeks pills at one time  no evidence of moisture so it seems to be moistureproof as advertised
i placed it on the mattress and my families have less itchy after  it shipped from japan and it took a long time to wait
love the variety  little large but good
very cute i just wish there was a little more color variety the quality was good though
my mother blood pressure went up in this bad supplement i will never buy this vitamin k2 product again 
worked good in drone i got  min flytime
i wore this navel ring for a couple days before it started to crack and completely broke apart cheap and a waste of time better to spend a couple dollars extra and get one that lasts over a week
i was looking for something quick and easy to use on customers vehicles when they brought their vehicle in to get work done we like to return the customers vehicles better than when they dropped them off so we wash windows vacuum the floors and we thought wiping he dash down would be nice it definitely worked for that purpose of a free added service the customer wasnt expecting i liked that they were individual so we didnt need to worry about wipes drying out or someone leaving the lid off
if you have a hard time hearing  see a professional this thing is a complete waste of money it just does not have any amplification power none as little as this works you can just turn the tv up one  click instead this has no noise filtering or other sound enhancing that are included in all modern hearing aids imo this is just a pump and dump scam to get a few quick bucks before it dissapears from sale
i love these body scrubs  they are great for removing dead skin and leaving me feeling clean
doesnt make my eyes itchy and it works
works wonderful on sore tired feet
my gua sha is the best i love how my face feels when i massage it with my gua sha
it was okay
nothing worse than broken glasses this is a great kit lots of needed pieces of course they are very small it is very difficult to fix your glasses that you need to see through in order to fix your glassesthe case makes it very easy to keep track of those small pieces and the mini screwdriver needed to make repairs
does what it says but just not fast enough for me i was looking for a product that would soften nails in a few hours instead of overnight i guess patience is a virtue
im a hand therapist and this is by far the best delivery system for dexamethisone 4mgml solution  does not sting the patient and it really gets the med to go through the skin wonderfully  nothing better out there
i didnt read the done print photo gives the impression that you are purchasing a box of bandages but only one arrived  for one bandage is a bit steep for my wallet
very deceptive these were originally titled as large stones when they arrived i thought surely there was an error these would maybe be suitable to use in between toes maybe as a professional licensed massage therapist and business owner these are a total waste of money
the straws used to blow then up were just a bit too short and  of the  i ordered did not hold their air
very cute with a whimsical saying  most laundry room signs are funny and this one is no exception
i used this when i wasnt feeling well and within  days i was better it also helps when i need to make a bm the taste is just right
still in the trial phase will follow up with a final review
i love this brand  their products are trustworthy and effective  this supplement works exactly as described  i love the easy to swallow vegetarian capsules and that this is made in a certified us factory  i would recommend this product to others and will be purchasing again in the future
very happy with this product
not powerful enough wish i could return it
if you need phytoceramides this is the one  i tried several brands before this one this was the best for medown thru the years i have learnedif its coming out of utah its good stuff  it certainly bears true with this product
the brief instruction mentions a handle  times buy never described or illustrated which part is the handle  also it said it comes with  dental cases but there was only  the fit was well enough for what you paid for
very poor quality itchy and not finished properly  all i did was take it off the paper hand it was on and the thumb holes started to come apart  worse this item isnt returnable  do not buy
great for partials and works great on full dentures toolasts longer than regular store bought for full dentures
update this does not fit brass knuckle round tip carts does not fit stizzy cartsperfect adapter for flat head cartridges this is easy to use sometimes need abit of hand movement to get the head on just right for a powerful pull perfect for users wanting to change up cartridgewater pipe routine also very happy to get extra filteration of live resin that is rough on the throat
i bought this item and been using it for  weeks and its seems everything okay but it is not rust proofand seller has been advertising as rust proof caddyi would say dont bother buying with this sellerif you want to waste your money you can try this seller
theyre simple they work and theyre reasonably small they work on all masks that dont have ear loops that are super thick and they are even reusable if youre pairing them with disposable masks
smells very good  colors work in my bathroom
its easily adjustable and easy to attach to masks ear loops  however itll keep sliding down from my head toward my neck  placing the mask loop above my ear helps but then it also puts some pressure to my ear  overall it is better than wearing mask directly on my ears but doesnt work as well as i expected
mom is legally blind and needs to have an address book listing her friends and family in one place  this is the perfect book to have a listing with plenty of places to write names addresses and telephone numbers
this easily twists open and has a large opening to fill with water i like it because you can quickly choose the water temperature from the faucet fill and use it worked perfectly right out of the box

this is the only thing that works on my baby girl along with their cream no other products work like this one ive been using this stuff since she was about  months and shes about to be  months

the first two came with plugs for europe not the us and i returned each in turn to amazon they had me order from a different vendor and while it came with the right plug it didnt work amazon let me return it and try again after four tries because amazon is wonderful none of them worked t is a great idea but not if it doesnt work
disappointed with the comparison of using the liquid format of mangosteen  sad that its getting so hard to find but the capsule format is not as effective as the liquid
after about a week of taking it i noticed a huge differencei felt an in instant boost in energy and focus which helps me prepare for a full day of working off of a computer literally saves me from falling asleep at my desk and it tastes great and easy to swallow absorbs better than any other brand is a good value compared with other optionsand i have to say this vitamin b12 is liquid form that easily absorbed than pills or tablets and has a advanced technology of liposomal formula thats something that other b12 doesnt have this form could help to carry the vitamin b12 deliver deep into body for better absorptioni am really happy i found this one i would recommend to anyone if you are in the market for b12
i really like that i can add flavor to my daily water intake and get my collagen in at the same time this has good ingredients and the flavor is pretty good it was a little thicker in consistency than i was anticipating  but it still blended well  just something i had to get used to overall  i really like this
i have been using this product for months and my hair loss is still a problem do not recommend

not much to say a nice retrospective of some of the most beautiful pmoysmost likely wont become a collectors item unless you get it signed by a few of the ladies
so this is a very economical heating pad  it works very well the construction could be better  for less than  it really is worth the money  unfortunately i turned my chair too fast and too far and broke the cord in half at the power button  ill be ordering another as its the only usb heating pad ive been able to find  however i would be willing to pay more for a better design
this sponge is perfect for my sensitive skin works great when used with a body scrub too highly recommended
its a cute bulldog it shouldnt be considered a stress ball as it is really hard plastic and not that flexible
very high quality easy to use
the style is nice really liked itbut the chain kept flipping over and the length should of been shorter i returned it back
so far so goodi think ill like them
i use these all the time put them in all my shoes and they are absolutely great
uck i cant deal with this chalky stuff it will go into the compost
these thongs really fit with firm support i only wear them for special occasions but they could be worn as every day underwear the size does run small and i would recommend ordering one size larger
good for cleaning however i like a stronger smell
im not going to lie this book is perfect came in great condition has great prompts and is adorable butttt it takes a considerable amount of time to complete worth it but wow
not as tough or as strong as the original as seen on tv product goes flat faster good price the originals last forever these will last a while they still help with plantar fasciitis will opt for originals from now on if you find the originals have too much height for you then these would be a great alternative option seems to be a different type of filler material for pad i would give originals  stars plus these i would give a 
hubby likes it  thats all i know

this was a sturdy ice scraper mine perviously had a broken handle so i was pretty happy with a new one this was great because not only does it scrape ice off my car but it also extends mine before hadnt done that overall im quite content with my purchase
very unsatisfied with product no type of suction an it keeps cutting off i will be returning it
cute cover but as we found out  there are a lot of different samsungs out there so this didnt fit our fault  find one for your specific model 
its just not what it says it is and that is all sadly and disappointing
bitter bitter bitter i still drank it in different ways hot cold in different rooms lol  i did not receive a relaxed feeling i do not foresee me purchasing this product again
could have sworn i could return this if i purchased through amazon total waste of money smells awful waste of money
i love these they are so much better than i anticipated
these are great  day pill boxes they come apart to fill with pills  once back together the button in the middle spins by one day with each press the little dispenser drawer flips down so you can just dump the pills in your hand very nice lightweight plastic but good quality its a little thicker than i expected so my jewelry part use wont work but i now have color coded pill boxes for family travel
best glutamine product mixes well into your favorite drinks very affordable and great after a workout
great product at a good price
it is easy to use and it works i was thinking it is just an other peace of  but it really works
so much smaller than what the size chart said so i dont know where these are made but they should check their size chart because im very disappointed gave it to my daughter
works great keep them in the car for after car washes
the three stars is not for the pool itself which is pretty awesome but since the company that sells it plumstruck deserves zero stars i compromised and used three  other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue but since the description specifically mentions a ladder i thought the problem was fixed when amazon and i both contacted plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool plumstruck repeated ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included  since the pool is useless even dangerous without the ladder this issue must be addressed by the ad  that being said amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price so if the company would just change their wording people could figure all of this out in advance  amazon is investigating the company so hopefully all of this will changesome people mentioned a heater but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description i was actually worried it would only work with the heater and i didnt want to have to use a  outlet so i was relieved that it doesnt have one if i decide i need a heater later i will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation i will never order anything through plumstuck again they are a  horrible company if you can find this pool through someone else i recommend it it is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workouti also want to add that amazon sells a salt water conversion system that my local pool store also sells for a lot more money that the pool representative says will work with this pool so i will soon be able to convert it to salt water
perfect storage case to encase the massager and long plug
these are billed as medium toothbrushes they are super soft like little kid toothbrushes  i dont even feel like they are cleaning my teeth  no bristle shedding observed tried two of the pack so far  the head and handle are a little rough but i didnt not experience any splinters  but if your mouth is so sensitive you need this level of softness in a bristle the wood might be too much for you
i never thought id order a broom onlinebut years ago i bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom i had ever used i have never found another since then that even comes closei even replaced the old handle when it broke so i could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones i could find locally so i came online to see if i could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after years of hard useand low and beholdamazon had one i paid significantly more for this one than i did my original one and its worth every penny this one is biggeri originally had the  the reason i like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it id repurchase this several times over happily it has made me a broom snob lol 
i dont actually know if these work or not because they are so thick that my feet wont fit into any of my shoes if i put these into them first
these diapers if you get the bundle packs off of honestcom will cost you as much as the organuc diapers bought off the shelf the difference is that these diapers hold sooo well my son was breastfed the first  months and breastfed babies poo alot and its always runny never had a leak organic diapers aling with organic wipes n cremes have been the only thing that has helped my son and his super sensitive skin i highly reccommend the whole honest baby line
stands up great on solid floors it is also flexible making it very easy to use gives the added stability needed in a way thats not as bulky as most i love it
loved these  they were perfect for my wedding pies and my guests loved them
i love it smell so earthly this stuff make me so much energii recommend 
good masks fit well liked the assurance of the filters
dont think that they are real propolis or worth it
i just saw that one of them is already expired i purchased this on april  2018 the box was expired on jan 2018
perfect size to grip its soft but not too soft easy to clean
lot  has a funky mixture its different than the usual formulai hope it is safe and as the label statesthe last shipments have had this lot so im wondering if this is the last supply of this product since it seems to be out of stock most places
a little heavy but its great
gets bugs off easy and the bike stayed looking clean  very few bugs stuck after using it
i really wanted this to work out and i was originally excited when i first stated using this i was surprised after charging how quickly the battery died and now it will not charge after only one use my poor dog looks goofy because half their body was cut fur was only a couple of inches and well brushed i will be returning because i am very disappointed
been using dr a while on my daughter and no rash at all she can use this product without reacting thank god and its the y thing with a scent that she can use
product is a little small so if you order and snug fit might want to go up a size
smells wonderful  this is our second bottle
large amount works great for salt water fly patterns only thing id like to see is a pure white color other than that its perfect
collagen is a part of my daily routine usually in coffee since coffee is part of my daily routineeach packet has  calories and  g of protein all from cow collagen peptidesunflavored so nothing to interfere or overly sweetenpricier than similar collagens and the serving size is larger than some others as wellstill these are convenient packets for on the go the packets are thoughtfully designed very easy to open no scissors needed
always disappointed when you find out they lie about their size  lol  this is not  inches more like   this is definitely a mini massager
this battery is even better than the original batteries that came with my hearing amplifier so far lasting from 30am to 7pm well see how long it takes to start running down faster great buy
this stuff is the absolute bees knees i only couldnt give it  stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted so about  of it was already spilled out so i had to clean it off and was left with what was still inside the product itselfworked amazingly my hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job and even with gloves on the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands this is the first thing i use as soon as i get home from a long day the scrubber it comes with is stiff bristled so it holds up well a little product on the nail scrubber and its easily cleans all the grease and dirt right off the product itself is a 1010 but they need to work on the packaging and getting it sent out in something more secure i know delivery drivers smash up the boxes and so the original manufacturer cant be to blame but if it were my product i would put more filling or bubbles wrap the product to keep this from happening i had a friend that had the exact same issue with this product arriving damaged solid product all in all
this product lasted about a week before getting a hole in it even when it was just out of the box and blown up properly it fails to aid in much of anything and is loud when moving your partner around on it picture the sound of scraping your hand over a taught balloonyeah thats sexynot next time i get the real deala liberator product
this little bottle helps me take the edge off when i am a bit tense or nervous and its all natural  no side effects or harmful chemicals in the body  i love many of the bach remedies
good brush but slightly too short also a bit messy with the fibers coming off in the beginning but it was the best option for me as i needed something that could fit through a narrow bottleneck and didnt want something made of animal bristles for ethical reasons
these are my favorite masks they fit my face well  are comfortable
i did not like these they kept slipping off
returning started in big bold print on the box not waterproof so cant use in a shower
this is absolutely the very best film that ving rames has ever made his performance was amazing totally outside of his expected roles his portrait of a gay drag queen is exquisite it shows a depth of understanding and empathy which has not been seen is years his performance is more than deserving of an academy award not withstandinq  that this offering does not qualify for such an award
love it
i just bought this item at walmart  oz bottle for  
i am not able to use the cover for storing  travel  it also does not sit down to the base not a major issue but want to share this maybe a return also dont care for the bamboo like popsicle stick thank you
i like the easy and quick pouring sprout the attach measuring cup is easy and good
after reading many frustrated customer reviews and having two separate personal experiences with what appears to be the current state of affairs with modern digital bathroom scales for the majority of scales you simple cannot get consistent repeat readings this scale is the exception and just greatfor some reason it seems to be really hard to design a digital scale that reads the same when you make multiple weighings one right after another whether the scale is too sensitive to subtle changes in the positioning of the feet or its some other factor entirely ive found its common to get over half a pound difference between repeat weighingsbut not with this scale the reading changes at most 0 lbs and usually is exactly the same hallelujah
great feel of card for professional environment  i will continue to purchase  the sympathy cards are also a great deal
lcarnitine is an excellent
i was looking for a latex insole as i have some in some naot shoes that i find comfortable and love the comfort of latex bed pillows  i was surprised to find that not many brands offer a latex insole and many advertise themselves as latex free  too bad because i find latex to be a very supportive and buoyant material and i went for a short walk with these insoles in my rykas yesterday and they were very comfortable  the only downside is that there is not a good selection of sizes and i am a size  in shoe  so my toes on my bigger foot could feel the bottom lining of my shoe but the rest of my feet were comfortable on this insole  i will definitely buy another pair however
great product and fast shipping  thank you
i love the smell and everything about this leave in treatment i have used it for years
does what it says it will
i hate the old fashioned squeezy lash curlers and had given up having curled lashes when i saw that there were curling irons for lashes i was excited but was unwilling to shell out a lot of cash for something that might not work this curler was really inexpensive and had no reviews but it looked exactly like one that cost  times as much so i thought id give it a go im glad i did because it really works and has most of the features that the more expensive ones have  this is a winheres the rundown of what i like its rechargeable so no batteries it charges quickly and one charge lasts a couple of weeks it has  heat settings ive tried them all and even the lowest works well its easy to clean and has a cover to keep it protected when its not in use i do want to mention that the instructions advise you to put a coat of mascara on before you use the curler and then to use another coat when youre finished curling all of the curlers i looked at said this but ive started just curling my lashes before putting any mascara on and it works just as well maybe better because sometimes my mascara would clump when i did it the other way it might just be me but i like it betterthis is a great curler at a great price  definitely worth it
at least  years ago an orthopedist gave me a genumedi knee support when i was experiencing knee problems from a car accident ive used it on an interim basis since then and its worked very very well its finally showing wear and i was delighted to find a new one on the net it offers the same comfort and quality as the old one has
large print very easy to use and just a great bible for my wife who is korean  would recommend this to any person who can read korean
test booster
ive been using neroli hydrosol on my face for years  i saw this one for considerably less that my usual brand and it was supposedly organic so i figured id give it a try big mistake first off it had a weird strong scent not a subtle neroli scent like the one im accustomed to i sprayed some on my face anyway and within seconds my face was itching like nobodys business i find it hard to believe that this is pure organic neroli hydrosol
does the job like it
came early
ok look  its advertised as a flame less candle so thus  i foolishly expected it to look a little bit like a candlemuch like other reviewers have stated the biggest issue i have with this is the electric plug i cant even create the illusion of a candle with that thing attachedthe look is bad the cord is a bad idea and it in no way resembles a candle so much as a badly lit lamp of some sortat least the smell is good when you stand really close to itdo not buy this if you value your money check out the other  any other version by any other company that does not have a cord attached at least then you can pretend its a candle instead of some lame lamp that doesnt even light the area around itself enough to find the on and off switch
works well inside finish is a little rougher than i would have hoped for but a good buy for the price
best out there
i like the product
this breath analyzer is not fully precise but it is very good to follow the alcohol level trending upwards or downwardsthe size is good to keep with you in the pocket or even in the car key
i was so disappointed when colgate weekly clean was discontinued  i loved that productat first i really did not care for this product  i was put off by the fruity rather than minty taste but after using this for two months i am a convert  it cleans really well and  brightens really well without the grit factor of the colgate product  the tube size is generous and the price excellentbe prepared to wait a long time for the arrival  it took a month and the package was completely open and the product just laying inside upon arrival
purchased for dog
wife loves it
just what i wanted and received
very heavy duty product loved that there was no grease marks that showed through outside when food was stored in there
i like it useful for my swollen ankles very silky feel to the socks just wish that it was available in other colors as well
as described high quality part just too big for my application
after being on an iv to control dehydration due to high output ostomy for several months adding drip drop to replace regular drinking water enabled us to remove the picc line and resume a more normal activity level  just wish it was more affordable
as expected
uncomfortablecant fall asleep with it on
i like the taste but not some of the ingredients
there are only  bags in this order  i read as   they are very small  i would call them small and extra small  they are well made and the pictures on them are good  but not worth 
perfect product came as expected would recommend
these do not work at all i still have trails in my yard from whatever it is digging and it even took one of these out of the location after the 1st night another location where i placed this now has a fresh trail running underneath it waste of money
pretty tags but you have to pay if returning
good product works well
ok but thought they would be a little stronger
it feels really nice and it glides through my fine hair fairly easily its pretty easy to hold too
i bought this for facial pain and these are a super fit i use flour sack clothes as a cover for these they are super soft and the clothes provide a long length to wrap around my head to hold the cold pack in place i have migraines and these make my life so much better im glad i bought these
nice and comfortable
it was great having it all together
these are great for my elderly grandmother  she can reach her back easily
i have a  year old boy need i say more  i use these all of the time for him and myself diyer
lost  lbs in  days never happen with me before love it order few more already will post the next results thanks 
good material used for my my cat who loves it
this works wonders if youre wondering if youre going to buy this do it helped so much with my hormones despite having hormone issues
making healthy choices
this was recommended to me by my alternative holistic doctor for absorbing toxins he told me to put  drops in a cup of hot water so that something that is in the cilantro that is not good is nuetralized by the heat of the water wait  minutes then drink i am taking it with chlorella another toxin absorbant and herbs he has also prescribed for me
dr mercola wouldnt put his name on something he wouldnt think is a great product so i think you can buy this filter with confidence
this is definitely not a highquality set however it does give you an idea on how to set up and use a gun and use the practice skin this comes with everything you need to learn how to start tattooing including two guns needles bottle for sanitizing soap soap not included practice skin power box rubber bands ink and morethis comes with no instructions on how to work these guns so you have to google how to set this up and how to work it which is not good if you have no idea what youre doing i almost want to take this kit down to my local tattoo shop and ask them how to set this up just in case ive been doing it wrong because honestly i have zero clue i figured out the general idea but that was about itout of the two guns one arrived broken and will not turn on when hooked up the other one stops working randomly and i did double check and make sure that the cables were inserted fully the guns themselves feel pretty cheaply made but look kinda cool i do like the hardy look they have going oni havent used this on actual skin yet as im definitely not an expert and really never touched a tattoo gun until nowbut the ink didnt have great results on the practice skin so i dont think i would even attempt it on real skin even with practiceoverall i think this would be an okay starter kit if youre just wanting to learn how to set up a tattoo gun and maybe tattoo the practice skins or some fruitbut youll definitely want an upgrade if you want to tattoo skin also keep your fingers crossed that the guns arrive in working conditioni received this item at a discount  in exchange for my honest  review this had no effect on my opinion of this product and i would have said the same thing if i had paid full price
product was as described
first the mat did not have a plastic cover over it just mailed in a thin box but no damage  this is made in china if you want to know where  it looks made well and strong the brittles are firm but not going to hurt but the suctions only half hold up probably good for feet not the back
great for my toddlers eczema very moisturizing and seems to soothe his flare ups works better than aveeno love it
great
the size and appearance are just as pictured suction works well stays on hands free and you have to really work to accidentally dislodge it asinb01gnrh60k huayang rotary twist cupping nipple suction massage breast enhancer pump stimulator toy this came one to a package and is shipped in a bubble mailer
the five star rating is because they are so cute and a fun item to use on letters packages and the like  i love to display my favorite animal on my cosrrrespondence to family and friends  business correspondence  well no  im an adult that has loved the panda since childhood and still collect figurines  pictures etc  this tape is useable in any length of  tape or individuallly by cutting what is wanted  makes me smile when i see and use the tape i definitely would recommend this prduct to anyone who loves pandas or just animals for a fun item to use  i like the tape period
my sons feet hurt when wearing his baseball cleats   after calling his pediatrician they suggested buying a pair of arch supports for plantar fasciitis  i purchased these and they worked out for him  no more pain
this set has the perfect summer colors i absolutely love and am a big fan of the glitter polished super halo and dimensional had a nice reflective others colors are bright and pigment with one coat youd be good to go
i looked for several weeks for this item in all the grocery stores that i normally shop at i live  miles from the nearest walmart so i was getting desperate for a replacement for the one that i did have i had to keep sticking it back on whenever i tried to was something and it was getting to be a real pain i like and would recommend this item to make your cleaning easier
i love this and will continue to order it  i am new to this but so far so good  good 
given the opportunity to do it again i would not have gotten the white cast iron enamel kohler sink i always wanted but too late we got it and cleaning it is a pain in the neck you need this special cleaner though there are other brands of it but you cant just use dish soap this dissolves stains and metal pot marks you cannot just wash the sink and you can scrub it this is overpriced for what it is and it is a downright shame you cant clean the sink traditionally with dish soap sponge and water
a great addition for usage in reusable face masks i feel more protected and safe knowing i have these filters installed in my mask
dont sleep on this movie its hella
thanks
i love venus aqua  deep moisturizing cream because it feels so refreshing on my skin  i also love the smell
update now it wont even turn on ugh  gave it a two because atleast it works when you put the battery in and turn it on most of the current is in your hand not where you put the end of the pen i put it all over my husbands neck and nothing but i felt it in my hand and when he tried he felt it in his hand  cindy 
came much later then expected but it arrivedits not very waterproof or smudgeproof but its a pretty decent eyeliner for the price
i would not recommend this product door is super slow to open and does not work some time  for the price not worth it at all
great product and perfect for doing small finishing touches on my woodworking
lightweight and spacious  i pack it to its max
this tonic quietness in my actions i have move around the house  i feel more active
great battery life charges well a bit heavy but works great
great
i love this little fish the purpose of the purchase was to have one place to put my glasses as i take them off to work at the computer then hunt them down go elsewhere to find them hidden somewhere ie under papers to the right to the left etc so this serves a great purpose i am not an artist but the paint quality seems good the paint is thick and covers the fish well with no streaks and it is covered well the ads colors are accurate and perfect for me glossy but not overly shiny the colors are as depicted in the ad see attached pics the notch for the eyeglass frames is about  0 mm at the bottom and   mm see pic with ruler thus the fish can accommodate a wide variety of frame thicknesses my frames a very thin and while the fish works well it does take a bit of placement to balance the eyeglasses more of an awareness than extra work the fish also seems more stable with hisher nose to the desktabletop i would guess this as well with thickerheavier frames i removed the bar code sticker between the finarms and there was a hole i dont know if it could go on a stand of some sort ceramic dust also came out of the hole revealing that the fish is mad of ceramic and not wood or plastic all in all very pleased with artisanship and functionality
been looking for a well balanced recovery drink love all the natural minerals and nutrition  you would never know its a healthy product based on the flavor and the ingredient list it tastes like  a blow pop
the large pill organizer is a great deal if you take a lot of pills dailyyou could give the smaller one to a friend that takes less medications or you could put it in a larger purse andor for traveling
easy to use
love these and this big box will last for awhile nice with company stays colorful long enough
while the color shown in the amazon listing is what i was looking for the vacuumpacked bag of chips that arrived appear pulverized the item description is for inch chips but id say that perhaps  of them are that big and certainly none bigger the rest are  or inch and even smaller  down to tan dust im not going to ruin the hard work on my epoxy floor with this
quality of bag is great however adult pandas were received as seen in attached image and i needed baby pandas for a crafting project  advertised image is not always what is received
super effective and great tasting
seems to be in good condition but  it didnt give nearly as stong a mint feeling or smell on my clothes that i was looking for still its laundry detergent but i may have to look for something else
this thing is just loud and doesnt work i bought in hopes it might actually do something and it ended up just being loud and blowing out a tiny bit of air i could just blow on my hand for the same results just save your money on this one
i liked the product
light weight
heres a great ally in the battle against noise simple yet very effective earplugs you cant go wrong with those ive been using them along with my 3m peltor earmuffs full reviews of these on my amazon profile and the result is superb when it comes to sleeping theres no better friend and because they come in a pack of   yep two cans full of earplugs  you can rest assured they are going to stick around for a whilegreat product indeed
cheap and cheesy doesnt clean clothes well at all nor give off fresh scent
made well great sizes i bought a second set for the girlfriend she uses all of then and often
these are truly beautiful soaps nice collection and the scents are nicely balanceda choice for any discerning customer my favorite is the lemongrass but i like all four colors and scents i will buy again
i love it because it smells incredible 
no more dropping glasses or trying to find them helps keeping them from being scratched a good choice 
i have a prescription pair and these are not quite as comfortableas far as frames go a little narrow on my large mans face it is nice to have several pair around the house and garage for when i need them the optic quality is  nice and no eye strain  or fatigue
i couldnt find these batteries anywhere  but amazon to the rescue
prosnice lookingsolidly builtconspainful and unpleasant leg massage it doesnt massage the feet with rollers like some other chairs it only has a painful squeezing action using air bags even on the lowest setting it was extremely painfulfeels low end in terms of features compared to other massage chairs in the 2k3k price rangeno memory feature  you have to recalibrate the massage heads for height and width each time you use it it defaults to the original settings each time it turns off whenever you select a new massage setting for a few moments you get a very uncomfortable massage while you have to wait to slowly move the massage heads to a comfortable position using the keypadshoulder and neck massage doesnt work well couldnt find a comfortable shoulder and neck setting and it felt weakfaux leather but i think most massage chairs are using faux leather now
this face steamer worked well  fill it with water turn it on and wait for the steam  the steam took about  or  minutes to heat but after that the steamer worked well  easy set up and easy to use
i tried this when i was on vacation in australia and loved the way it stuck  stayed put on an injured foot like nothing ever has before  it doesnt leave that sticky residue either
great alternative to heated socks worth the investment
got the wrong item we got the white cheddar crisps instead but felt like it wasnt worth it to exchange
i paid a lot of money for something that broke within  months it breaking and not just a cracked it broke in half at the hinge it is horribly designed and isnt compact at all do yourself a favor and buy the more expensive option or you will be like me and end up paying more then you should have
item arrived ahead of time and was given as a gift very nice
nice and simple cups for party favors
these are really cute my husband loves them in our new rv
makes great smokes saves a ton of money
love the style
i think i fall under least sofisticated consumer or my girls are just too bigterrible i know if i liked pain i could do a better job with duct tape
given as a gift gifted thought it was beautiful she was thrilled recommended give to you favorite lady
wonderful product unfortunately i was unable to use them as i have very narrow feet but the company happily refunded my money
not good for thick hair takes a long time doing small sections at a time however curls come out very nice if you have the time
product is great
videoida14d2d6c4863a194fc4763164d523aed the soft colored toothbrushes are designed to be deeply clean and smooth ants dirt bot type do not worry utilizing optimal technology helps to keep teeth completely clean suitable for families picnics work
its a good brush i would recommend it but does not replace a flat iron
love this cuts close enough for me and it was smooth
three stars because not sure that the sizing error was my fault or it just doesnt fit the main reason we purchased was to cover the extended front piece shown in the picture of produce with red circle
very good would buy again
nixoderm was so good it made my rashes disappear in  a week it has been a family favorite for years ever since i was a child in jamaica west indies
thanks amazon for carrying this product bought this a year ago in australia my nails skin and hair has been healthier grown faster i recommend this product over any other for hair skin and nails
perfect
theyre well made and comfy
its a nice face cleaner brush i only charged it once and have been using it daily for a month  charge holds up very well it comes with soft brush regular  brush and a polishing sponge and every time i use it i feel like it really makes a difference for my normally greasy oily skin  i have less dirty clogged pores now and my skin is shiny and soft  it definitely helps get rid of bacteria and old skinits a nice durable product  i would recommend it if you are looking for a facial cleanser brush 
a litttle too soft for my liking but with all the great features on the tooth brush im not surprised still use it so its doing something right
good quality product
delicious meal replacement
not only is the charm and necklace themselves so pretty they can be used for individual support by changing the color of the aromatherapy pad  i wear orange in mine for my personal medical problem  you dont have to have a medical problem to wear one of these but could wear it in support of someone you know who does  i have quite a few aromatherapy necklaces but this one is my favorite
i buy readers to go with everything i wear yellow readers are hard to find these fit well my reader cords dont slide off the nice bamboo temples and they dont give me headaches like them a lot
not as good as expected cancelled some of the noise but didnt function as good as expected
like many women out there i have a husband with a terrible snoring problem his snoring is so loud he often makes it difficult for me to fall asleep or will wake me up in the middle of the night  i bought this product after trying other nasal strips nose inserts and other items recommended by friends and familymy husband is a good sport and happily put the device on before we went to bed  after a few minutes he quickly fell asleep and i didnt hear a peep out of him  i was so relievedi tried the device on myself just to see if it was comfortable and would be easy to wear the thing i noticed was that although the device was extremely comfortable it would slide around a little on my head not a deal breaker but thought i would mention it anywayif you have a snoring problem or have a spouse that does  you should really consider purchasing one of these snoring straps it was definitely the thing that helps me get the sleep i neededwhen i purchase an item i rely heavily on the customer reviews to verify the sellers claim therefore i give my honest opinion so hopefully it can help others i received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review my thoughts on this product belong to me and are in no way manipulated or influenced if this review has been helpful to you please click the yes button below
does what it says
quaint beautiful good quality paper i enjoyed wrapping gifts with it
love the different sizes
very crispi and have a good buckwheat flavor
like i said its a great deal i got this and then got the  pack 6000 papers when i ran out of these
works
well it did keep me from rolling onto my back but i did not use it per the horrible directions  directions are minimal  it has a picture showing strap to chest not waist but doesnt say what the benefit of chest vs waist is  the strap is awful  it is rigid and bulky and feels like sleeping on rocks for the most part  first  i am a woman and strapping this across my breasts was not appealing or comfortable  i tried just below and the strap hurt my ribs so i went with the obvious choice and strapped it to my waist as directions said not to do  worked fine strapped around waist  i was unable to roll to my back  i will be changing out the straps as they are uncomfortable  i want straps that have some flex and are thinner  i dont understand how this would facilitate good breathing strapped tightly around the chest  this was the only product i could find to keep me from rolling over so i am grateful it was available  however it could be more comfortable with better straps  the directions are probably vague to avoid making claims so the fda doesnt shut this down but a bit about what the benefit of chest vs waist would have been nice especially as it is uncomfortable as directed  it is also darn hard to inflate
this chin strap was such an upgrade over my old one  strong well made easy to adjust and wear
my dad and brother are loosing their sight and found it difficult to write checks this guide has been very helpful in allowing them to maintain independence with their finances easy to use and a definite recommend
easy to hold and use doesnt take a lot to get a smooth finish easy to use wet or dry love that they are labeled
i had to get a replacement of these due to them coming to me broken  i did receive the replacement guess what 2nd set broke too  these are cheaply made
the problem is the packaging is overthetop guys i dont want to pay for fancy packaging just put it in a bag seal it and be done with it pass the savings on to your customers its seriously wasteful to put this tiny amount of powder into a fancy bottle and bag i know im paying too much when i see that i know im not getting a good value when i see that i think its probably a good product i dont notice any effects but yet i trust its doing something its probably foolish but i keep buying it because its one of the only dual water and alcohol extracts i will switch as soon as another alcohol extract comes on the market thats focused on value
i initially got the liquid version of chanca piedra because i was in pain and needed fast relief and the pill estimated delivery was further out than the liquid after i found the liquid version worked and i was getting low i ordered the pill version the pill version worked just as good as the liquid version and was a little easier because it didnt require 3xs daily dosage and didnt require all the water dont get me wrong you def need water with kidney stones but its hard to work and function in life when you are constantly going to the bathroom anyhow this stuff is great im so grateful it is available and enabled me to take care of my stones on my own rather than giving my hard earned dollars to docs who btw never mention this products existence
this organic whole grain hulled barley   lb bag is what it says it is i bought it as a breakfast food because of the blood sugar benefits not bad but time consuming
delicious
i found that that hard round bit that goes over your knee was very uncomfortable and actually made my knee hurt more
cant believe i had to search far and wide for a simple cup with a simple lid at a simple price to make a shake  this is perfect  no bells or whistlesjust a great little cup
seam runs along the bottom of your foot making the sock uncomfortable to wear i agree they seem to run large
granddaughter loves her doll plays with her all the time changes her clothesa great gift
this is my little escape  i feel so much better when i get up  louisiana doesnt hold high standards to massage this chair doesnt replace a human but it does better than what i can find locally  this was truly a great investment
thanks
what can i say except that i have never not taken a deer every single time i used this  now if you dont know how to scout this will not make deer walk right up to you  in other words deer need to be in the area to smell it
this stuff is great taste great and leave me full till my next meal 
really nice trimmer cuts hair easily no matter if its a beard mustache or cutting hair with designs
i was wearing smaller reading glasses until my son made fun of me for looking like a granny lol these glasses are perfect and i love that they come with slim cases for each pair
i actually bought them for my husband and he is very pleased with them like how they can be stored flat so they can be stored in a drawer or slipped under a chair
i was expecting something to remove the hair not cut it off
while ymmv i found this unpleasant to use and very irritating to my sensitive teeth ive tried others and had a similar problem but this was almost right out of the gate the pen is harder to use than a tray or strips because its hard to get into nooks and crannies but they generally do work i just couldnt deal with the sensitivity a hard no for me
i do believe this product works i bought it years ago and i cant remember what i paid for it or what site i went through but i didnt have any issues with being overcharged nor did i continue to be charged one thing i have to point out though is that i used crest whitestrips shortly before using celebrity sexy teeth i didnt notice any change in the shade of my teeth with the crest whitestrips so i started using celebrity sexy teeth as soon as i finished up the crest whitestrips i noticed really fast results using the celebrity sexy teeth the name itself sounds like a scam and thinking back im surprised i ever gave it a chance but im glad i did many people say it doesnt work for them but maybe using two products one right after another had something to do with it for me not to bash crest whitestrips but i didnt notice a single improvement after using them until i used this stuff right afterward huge improvement
great delivery exactly as advertised
just plug in the cord and bubble away your bathtub turns into an instant jacuzzi and yes its a little loud but you can place the canister outside the door  great for small bathrooms warning the bubbles are so relaxing you wont want to get out
this is a good idea in theory but this cheap piece of plastic is dangerous the silicone tip went right down our dogs throat the second time we used it luckily it is not a harmful material and we have a big dog but i worry a smaller pet could choke or have an obstruction in their throat i definitely would not recommend this item to any pet owners
slow shipping with quality image
dosent hold like it looks on the pictures very disappointed
beautiful bags will purchase again
a but smaller than expected  still good value
i bought this product at home goods for  but it worked so well for me that after a few trips to try and find it again i just gave in and paid double the price i am not an experienced collagen person but this one has great taste i tried a different one that was even labeled matcha but it tasted horrible this one tastes like a fake matcha is the best way for me to describe it but in a good way i feel the difference in my knees within  days i am  had a baby at  and was really feeling it this made me feel more mobile and i could feel the flexibility in my joints i hope to find it at a ross or home goods again but if not for me its worth paying double
my grandson is only one and he loves this we showed him how to use it and he carries it around scribbles and pushes the nose to erase it love the little panda
pretty interesting product very strong vibration when you press the power button to turn it on click the button again to switch different vibration mode has quite few different options rubber ring is pretty tight when you try to move it might stretch your skin

loved the koala cloth but the leather cord was too strongly smelling of chemicals it was intolerable removing the chemical smell meant removing the chemicals which of course made the leather stiff and unusable at least for now
none of the details or instructions for removal are in english  contents had a chemical smell

there were only  on the bag not   other than that  they work great
the taste was absolutely disgusting and i couldnt get it down i tried mixing it in juice also no go the after taste was horrible as well
just what we expected  as always a great buyworks great
when i first took this out of the box i was livid it seems like nothing more than a cheap slice of styrofoam worth maybe a nickel  i was tempted to return it with an angry note but i am desperate for back pain relief so i positioned it between the mattress and box springs under my sacroiliac as instructed for the first night in weeks i slept like a baby  painfree for eight hours straight i woke up feeling wonderful  maybe you can get the same results by cutting a piece out of one of those disposable styrofoam coolers  or maybe not i dont know what i do know is that this product works as advertised snd deserves  stars and two thumbs up
if i could give no stars i would stay far away pay more for something useable this rigid unribbon like product gets permanent crinkles as soon as you handle it im a make it work kind of person but no no this will not work for wrapping gifts

received this variety box today and found that it only contained two flavors  of each  so that was a bit disappointing  it wasnt as advertised  and then the box had a big sticker suggesting to warm the bars prior to eating to make them gooey and flavorfulthe flavor wasnt bad but not great  the sunflower one was a bit oxidized like sunflower oil that was sitting too long  the chocolate lava was more like a candy tootsie roll

when i placed the order i was somewhat frustrated because of the lack of a description of this item  nevertheless i took a chance on it and am delighted  it is big enough for one large bulletin board  border is included  the pieces are individual items that you can place on the your board anyway you want  it does come with instructions on suggested placement  the graphics are such that young children will enjoy it
the product is not as effective as the manufacturer claims i was somewhat disappointed that it did not provide the results that the manufacturer seems to practically guarantee i would not recommend this product it marginally does what the manufacturer claims
my daughter has always had trouble with swimmers ear and ear infections in general when she started swim class she started complaining about her ears hurting  amazon to the rescue and she loves wearing this headband and ear plugs  the ear plugs are soft silicone and molded easily to her small ears i broke each piece in half so i actually got two pairs  and the band holds them in place she has started even wearing just the band alone to keep the water out of her ears great product

darn it i wasted my  for nothing the suction is not enough to get my milk if i go more than l4 it hurts even at l4 its uncomfortable for me with my spectra i get  oz in  minutes and thats all i make which is not enough for my baby with this i pumped for nearly  minutes i got   oz and the worse thing happened when i tried to open it and pour milk into the bottle the whole suction part came out resulting spilling all my milk god i cried so much wish i could get my money back
good product
they work and fit the brush ferfectly
so giving this a try and since its supposed to be mostly natural ingredients im hoping it will not affect any other medications that i might be taking  but if youve never experienced a hot flash or middle of the night sweats its hell  mine were and are still so bad that i have to get up in the middle of the night just to change my clothes  initially when i read the packaging i was a bit confused as in one sentence it says cools hot flashes  promotes perimenopausal and menopausal health im not sure if the word promotes is the right word to describe someone going through menopause would want to hear  i would think words like prevent or  help slow the process are words that sound more comforting and reliable  every woman with hormones will inevitably have to go through this process and they want something that will work well quick and help to ease the symptoms  hopefully i can see more of a difference after i finish the entire bottle

pink zebra has been the worst experience for me that ive ever had when ordering things online not only does the stuff i ordered smell like vinegar and cheap dollar store spray but trying to get it returned has been the worst experience and still nobody has sent me a return label or contacted me back ive had to handle a trouble ticket as if its my job but the companies own supervisor tanisha doesnt care and makes you feel wrong for calling the office to get things taken care of its going on a week and i still have nothing resolved i might have to just dispute the charge with my bank and call it good and never order from pink zebra ever again

updatedat first i really liked these sleep masks i had to make a small adjustment but they seemed to work well so i gave them four stars well now that i have used it for a while the red sleep mask leaves black marks from the strap all over my sheets the black dye will not wash all the way out so i have ruined a nice set of sheets i dont know if this is the case with all the masks from this company or just mine so beware when you purchasethese sleep masks are pretty good especially for the price you get two masks two sets of foam ear plugs which i dont use and a carrying case i really like that these are contoured over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyelid the only reason they didnt get five stars is the nosepiece i found it to be a little too wide i had to perform minor surgery and cut out a small vshaped piece of material from the nosepiece in order to make the mask block out more light from the bottom and take pressure off the bridge of my nose now they work great but i probably decreased the lifespan of the masks but for the price i dont think that will be problem time will tell
this product did nothing for my back pain would not recommend
has everything i could ask for in a hydrating drink with bcaas flavor tastes more like a beverage than a supplement which is a good thing using the whole scoop may be a bit too strong for alot of people even when using a full sized blender bottle if you were looking for more of an og gatorade type vibe for your intraworkouts i would recommend using a little less which will also make it last longer
excellent product  with a good flavor
i like the way this laundry detergent cleans and i feel good using it because its not as harsh for our environment it smells great too i used their other products and have only good to say about this company
it really does help with both my back pain and rib cage pain  i found that it was better on top of my clothing due to one strap that cut into my shoulder but could just be me

i like the fact that this is a spf  lip balm the main reason i purchased it  the texture is smooth and glides on easily without being greasy or slick perfect  its not thick heavy or grainy either just the right consistency  very nice flavor without being overpowering or lingering too long  i can easily suggest it for both men and women since its not a shiny gloss  it stays on for quite a while but if i do need to reapply i purchased the  pack great dealonly 00 per tube soi can do that freely at will and as the mood strikes me with all i have to useha ha ha  very happy with my purchase will purchase again when needed

this works better than anything i have used and it keeps on working ive used some energy supplements in the past that work at first but then for some reason it stop working but this one is so good i am on my second bottle great stuff
not only was this a different brand but the product photo was misleadingthe ad shows  boxes but one arrived which makes this purchase absolutely overpriced to add insult to injury the item is not returnable

this stopped working after the first use

great quality
perfect for partiesdinners etc
i purchased these thinking theyd be like similar showershampoo brushes ive used in the past  theyre not  these have more teeth so when brushing your hair the teeth dont slip through your hair quite as easily  and they are not soft plasticalso when using in the shower i often clip the curved t handle to the shower head spout  unfortunately these wont stay put  they slip off after a few seconds  the curved t handle was the reason i purchased this model in the first place  most of the other models listed on amazon have either loop or grip handles that cant be clipped to the shower downspoutlastly ive noticed on one of these that the teeth shrank and deformed apparently after prolonged exposure to my preferred hair care product  this was a first for me since ive used similar brushes for years without this happening with others you just had to live with the teeth falling out over time  apparently the manufacturer felt that testing or at least researching the effects of different solvents commonly used in hair care products on the plastic used in these brushs manufacture was an unnecessary expense  and thats entirely okay  ill just post a lessthanenthusiastic review and never buy these againyoud think that something like a showershampoo brush would be easy to get right  apparently not  not recommended
absolutely trash looked and felt nothing like the photo i even had to do a double take to see if i got the right item and thats what it said it was im shocked this is the worst amazon purchase ive ever made retuned immediately
this vitamin c serum comes in a thick milky gel formula thats odorless  it glides over my skin effortlessly and absorbs instantly  its comprised of a premium formula thats so powerful potent clean and effective that you normally only find it in highend spas  this serum reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles  the penetrating formula not only cleans and moisturizes your skin it tightens ans smooths areas around your eyes chin neck and cheeks  it works as a deep cleanser to clean out the oil makeup and impurities from your pores so your skin reaches a healthier more radiant look  the hydrating formula allows your pores to breathe by allowing refreshing oxygen to penetrate your skin  its a refreshing change from heavier creams and serumsif you read my reviews regularly you know ive reviewed many serums especially vitamin c serums  for this reason i have chosen to use this review entry to share parts of an article that was published by my awesome beauty thats titled the complete guide to vitamin c serumshow to choose the best vitamin c serum   factors factor   vitamin c formthere really isnt a best form for vitamin c because there hasnt been that much research that shows which one is the most stable and still effectivewhen you are looking for vitamin c you should stick to the derivatives or actives that are tested and proven to work likeascorbic acidascorbic acid has the most supporting research but it is also the most unstable and can be quite irritating at higher concentrations however if your skin can handle it it is the go to active just make sure that the serum isnt oxidizedstill most companies prefer to use the derivatives because they definitely have longer shelf life which is critical for a cosmetics companymagnesium ascorbyl phosphatesodium ascorbyl phosphatemagnesium ascorbyl and sodium pretty much the same are watersoluble derivatives of vitamin c that many believe to be the best form of vitamin c for use in skin care productsthey believe this because it is less irritating and is more stable than vitamin c even better sodium ascorbyl or magnesium phosphate has the same potential as vitamin c in helping with collagen synthesis while keeping the concentrations lowerin the end for those who have sensitive skin or dont want redness sodium ascorbyl phosphate is probably a better choice than ascorbic acidstill sodium ascorbyl phosphate can still degrade when it isnt stored properly or exposed to light and air following the use by dates on the packaging is a must to ensure your get a product that still worksascorbyl palmitatethis form is the most frequently used fatsoluble soluble in oils derivative of vitamin c in skin productsit isnt irritating to the skin and is far more stable than vitamin c still even if it has good antioxidant properties it doesnt boost collagen synthesis as much as other derivatives and vitamin c doesso if you are going to choose an oilbased product that contains vitamin c you want to make sure that it has ascorbyl palmitatehowever it wont be nearly as effective as ascorbic acid magnesium ascorbyl phosphate or sodium ascorbyl phosphatenew derivativesthese derivatives are to be avoided because there hasnt been enough study into their benefitsyou might also find other derivatives such as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate which belong to the new derivatives that are slowly hitting the marketif you remember what we said about derivatives check the paragraphs above most vitamin c derivatives on the market including ascorbyl palmitate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate consist of the ascorbic acid fragment ascorbyl and a fragment of another acid eg palmitate or phosphatethese new derivatives have multiple chemical fragments that are bound to a single ascorbic acid fragment that protect against the core vitamin cso as you can guess it is like having more bodyguards protecting the core vitamin cthey are said to be more stable compared to the other derivatives and vitamin c itself some of these newer derivatives particularly the tetrasubstituted lipophilic ascorbates are also said to be more powerful in boosting collagen synthesis however you will need to put out a little more cash which might not be worth it just yet as we still havent found enough evidence or studies backing up those new derivativesto simplify it if you havenormal or oily skin use lascorbic aciddry or sensitive skin use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and rednesswe will keep a close eye on the new derivatives and will update our article in 2016 so you can benefit from the most up to date informationnote there are of course other derivatives such as a ascorbyl glucosamine ascorbyl glucoside etc but they really lack studies to warrant use so stay away from those forms for the time beingfactor   water based serum or oil based serumif your read carefully our previous paragraph you should be able to answer this questionas you obviously want the most potent vitamin c serum you will choose the most effective vitamin c forms  the oil soluble vitamin c derivative is not as effective as the water soluble ones so you should stick with a water based vitamin c serumyou can also notice that all our top  vitc serums are water based because they definitely gave us better results that is also why most vitaminc serums in the market are water basedthe other advantagethese serums are much lighter and will be much easier to add in your skincare routineas a reminder apply the serum right after washing your face so to let the serum sink in and give you optimum resultsfactor   percentage of vitamin c in the productthe percentage of vitamin c is a tricky factor for formulators as was confirmed by our cosmetologist and formulator friendyou do need a high amount of vitamin c to boost collagen production and help with hyperpigmentation but too much can actually cause irritation and redness  and you dont want to make people have the catch or being wrinkly or redthe goal is to find that just right spot  which can be harder than you thinkthe amount that you should look for depends on whether you have the vitamin c form or the lascorbic acid or the derivativesascorbic acid look for  in the productmagnesium ascorbyl phosphate or sodium ascorbyl phosphate percentages between  remember that these derivatives are as effective in lower concentrations as ascorbic acid word to the wisewhen you are using vitamin c serums and if your skin is pretty sensitive you should consider starting at the lower end and work your way up to a higher concentration so that your skin isnt put into shock you could irritate your skin and make it red and inflamed your skin may dry out and peel which is pretty much the opposite of what you want  dry skin can make you look wrinklier as was the case for several of our readers and  of our testers with sensitive skinstry to avoid pure vitamin c form like lascorbic acid and work with a derivative around  or  for the first month that was more than enough for their skin which showed impressive results example here of vitamin c serum for sensitive skinsso the most important criteria is not the percentage but how much  of vitamin c your skin needs to get results and how much you skin can standthis is a really personalized product and you need to find the right one for you  there is no one size fits all optionfactor   ph levelswhen trying to make a decision on what serum to buy ph levels should be one of the most important things you consider ph levels tell you how acidic the product is  the lower the ph the more acidic the product isnow many people will believe that stronger concentrations of lascorbic means that the product is superior to something with a lesser amount but that isnt necessarily the case the serum should have a ph level of  max preferably lower or it wont be able to penetrate the skin  which is why it needs to be acidic in order to be effective but also why it can be an irritant for some peopleskinceuticals is the one that holds the patent for the lowest ce ferulic serum available on the market it has a ph between  and 0 some of the more affordable brands arent that far above them though with ph levels ranging from 0 to they cant make it the same because it will violate the patent  but it is still low enough to be effectiveas for the derivatives the ph problem doesnt hurt as much because they can go for a more neutral phfor example magnesium ascorbyl phosphate has an ideal ph around  or  which is the ph of our skin this is why some serums that use vitamin c derivatives will come with a sensitive skin labelserums that have ascorbic acid ideal ph of around 0 to 0 which can be irritating for those with sensitive skinserums that have sodium ascorbyl phosphate ideal ph of around 0 to 0 which should not affect sensitive skinmany brands have a problem with ph it would seem in our testing the products werent well formulated and the ph was not within the ideal range for the best penetration of ascorbic acid thats why some people find vitamin c serums ineffective they probably came accross a bad formulated serum to start with obvioulsy we did not keep those useless serums in our top factor   better ingredients for effective team workvitamin c by itself can help your skin but there is a reason that many of the best products have more than one thing in ityou cant use one thing and expect miracles just like you cant eat a diet of only kale and expect to be healthyor happyyou need a little more help which is why it is good to go for a product that has other benefits or beneficial ingredientslook for products that offer tons of antioxidants especially if you are trying to avoid agingin some combinations antioxidants can strengthen each other and go above and beyond what they can do aloneone of those additions could be hyaluronic acid which helps to deliver moisture which can reduce wrinklesyou could also look for aloe vera green tea rosehip andor ferulic acidhaving more wont hurt your skin at worst it just wont help it so look for a product that will be able to deliver on more than one frontupdate you can find serum with  of lascorbic acid the most irritant form but the percentage of vitamin c is not the only criteria to check i definitely prefer less vitamin c like  of vitamin c if it means getting several other potent actives in the same serum that will boost the vitamin c actionremember also as we mentionned it previously the higher percentage of vitamin c  l ascorbic form the more irritant it can be so i know we all want the most effective serum but if you burn your skin it is not really what you want so be moderate and build up from therekeep in mind that usuallythe more vitamin c in the serum the less other actives manufacturers will add to keep the production cost moderatethe less vitamin c the more other actives manufacturers will add  as they have more margin to add other pricey activesof course the choice will depend on whether you use other serums or not in your skincare routine if you only use one serum it is usually a good move to use a serum with a blend of super actives vitamin c acid ferulic etc if you use other serums you can pick the serum with  lascorbic acid as you will bring other actives in the battle against wrinkles with your other serumsfactor   skin typeseveryone has different skin types from oily to natural to dry  and many of us have all three types at oncesome people will have better results with vitamin c derivatives while others will prefer to use the l ascorbic form  it is really a testing game until you find the one that works best for youif you have sensitive skin a product with a high level of ascorbic acid might harm your skin and you should aim to work with a milder optionsome people will be able to use only a little at a time and work up to the stronger levels while others will be able to use the stronger products from the start if you are having problems a useful tip would be to start by applying the product every other day and work up from therego by this rule of thumb when you are just starting outnormal or oily skin use lascorbic aciddry or sensitive skin use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and rednessfactor   avoid colored productswhen you search for products that have vitamin c or any derivatives try to find a product that is white or colourlessany colouring in the product could hide the signs of oxidation that render the product less effectiveyou want to be able to see a yellowish or brownish tintof course a lack of tint does not guarantee that your product is free from oxidation as the early oxidation stages are colorlesssome unethical manufacturers they do exist will even add colour to their products so that you cant spot the oxidation status  so they can even sell oxidised products without you knowing it  and they can hide the ugly truth however some only do this for marketing reasons  people equate orange or yellow with vitamin c so they tint it that so it looks betterstill we recommend you avoiding vitamin c products that arent colorless or whitethat way you will be able to check the degradation status and as a result the effectiveness of your antiaging  productfactor   packaging  storageproducts that contain vitamin c and its derivatives have sensitivity to air andor light that makes their quality degrade at a faster rate if they are stored incorrectlycompanies do their best in trying to create packaging that helps keep the products fresher for a longer time they use opaque tubes pumps or air restrictive bottlesyou will usually find amber dropper bottle or blue colored dropper bottle which enables to protect the serum from light for your information amber colored glass is said to protect a little more from light than blue colored glass but the difference is not that importantwhat you must remember is to avoid transparent bottles they cost way less for the manufacturer but it means for your vit c serum a shorter shelf lifeyet to get the best results out of your product make sure that you close them tightly to reduce the amount of air that can get in and place them away from lighttry to avoid exposing them to humidity  which means you shouldnt store it in your bathroom many people like to store antiaging products with vitamin c in the refrigerator if that doesnt sound appealing wrapping them in aluminium foil can helponce again make sure that you note the use by date on the packaging  they will be your best indicator of whether or not the product still has a change of being effectivefactor   brand reputationyep would you buy a product from an unethical brand that does not take customer service seriouslywould you even think of spending your money on a company that dont respect you as a customeryou should also definitely check the brand reputation check whether the brand is known for selling scams or fake serumsthere are unfortunately thousands of crappy brands in the internet selling you bottles of water with a simple gelling agent to make a serum that they would market as vit c serumwhen customers start to complain they simply take the money and shut down everything then they can create another brand and rinse and repeati know it sucks but that is the bad aspect of internet as we told you you will find thousands of vit c serums brands on amazon or other big e commerce websites they all claim to be the best serum on earthwe bought many serums to test and were really shocked by some brands selling crap so the big lesson to remember is to be criticalkeep also in mind our reviews dont necessarily mean your will get the exact same results as our reviewers we all have different skin thats why we usually like to give you the criteria and elements to know so you can better choose the most suited serum for your specific casefactor   pricingpricing of vitamin c products can vary greatlysome of the best products from skinceuticals are a luxury item while other brands are far more affordable of course there are a ton of products that fall right in the middleskinceuticals products are great but they might not be worth the money  ml bottles for  unless you have tons to spend and use  bills in the bathroom you can definitely find cheaper serums that are as effective on the other side you also have the serums that cost  and swear to be the end of all your skin problems those brands are created everyday which proposes serums for   with  of vitamin c   of hyaluronic acid  many other actives that are priceyyou look at the ingredients and see all of the buzzwords so you think it has to be a miraclewell just like fake designer bags on canal street these products tend to fall apart at the seams and not offer the results youve been dreaming of some of those products might claim that they are  vitamin c when you open them up and get a ton of water you will realize pretty quickly that it isntto sum it up you can definitely find a good serum that will deliver somewhere in the  range take advantage of sales and seasonal deals as they pop up quite frequentlyi chose to share the  simple criteria involved in how to choose the best vitamin c serum because i found it to be very information  i hop you can too  i like this serum featured in this entry because it contains sodium ascorbyl phosphate  this is one reason why my extremely sensitive skin does not react to it  its also water soluble which makes it more effective and doesnt leave any nasty residue  there are also other beneficial ingredients present such as aloe vera and green tea  really i cannot say enough about this productill sum it up by saying thisthis serum is comparable to other better known brands as far as the ingredients and other factors  yet its available at an affordable price  why pay more for the same thing  i also like the fact they back their product with a  money back guarantee  if youre not satisfied within  days of purchase return it for a noquestions asked  refund  thats a guarantee you cant really sneeze ati received this product at a reduced rate
i thought these would be good wipes but theyve turned out to be too thin its obvious that theyre not very good qualityavoid these unless you need kosher wipes
getting this was one waste of money this pump has no suction at all so disappointing
exactly as pictured
review of the footsmart carepeutic foot and calf beauty massager with infrared heated therapy model kh383i black purchased directly from footsmart 26nov2010 for received this foot  calf massager as a christmas present 2010first problemthe silver placard instrument panel had come off and was stuck on the side of the unit instead of over the lights on top of the middle section  when placard was replaced to its proper position it would again become unstuck after a day or sosecond problemthe unit has a receptacle with two jack pins that the power cord plugs into  the bases of the two jacks were not seated properly and prevented the power cord from being entirely inserted such that the plug itself would not seat properly  when the unit was being used the vibration would cause the plug to fall outthird problemwhen using the unit on my feet the unit eventually damaged my left foot rollers inside the unit squeeze the feet in an effort to massage them causing pain for about a week  a month later my left foot still feels sore on occasionfor the above three reasons i cannot recommend this product  i am returning unit to footsmart 18jan2011 in hopes of getting a refundtheshopper
good concept but not a good material
the product came with low power worked once or twice then didnt recharge  that was the whole point of getting it so that was disappointing
these socks are the most comfortable compression socks i have ever worn they have the best colors and i am so completely satisfied i threw all the others out in the trash great price so i ordered  packages and plan to order more in the future
i like the style of this hookah but it sits crooked and also arrived broken i did get my money back and ended up super gluing the pieces back together still works
the key worked my toolbox i lost key to
the  girls i bought it for raved about this strap on  they had a lot of fun
this brush looks good and feel amazing at first inspection  but does nothing to actually cleanse pores
perfect little box  easy to assemble and box closes nicely
great quality
disappointed because there were soccer and basketball  leis included which wasnt included in the description returning them as i needed all of them to be hawaiian
i put these in a pair of cheap slip on shoes  they are easy to cut to size and fit perfectly  they are super comfortable and converted a pretty horrible pair of shoes into a a super comfortable pair  so far they are holding up very well and have not skid around at all  it does take a couple hours of walking for these to mold to your foot shape but once they are broken in they remain super comfortable  great inserts
this product did what it advertised  i purchased it to put medicated lotion on my back and it works  instead of having to deal with pads you apply the lotion directly on the end of the paddle and spread it around  it is lightweight and easy to clean since the application part of the device is vinyl which wipes right off  i would recommend it as a solution for those who live alone or need to be able to self applicate lotion or medication on areas that are impossible to reach on the back  it also has a nice long handle which is a nice plus since you are able to reach all the way down your back with it
they work great theyre ear plugs i got tired of using balled up kleenex the only issue is the vibration noise of the cord traveling into the ear canal when it moves around while trying to study  i have used a pair of foam plugs from work that have a plastic cord and its quieteri like these tho i take the cord off to study for school doesnt matter as much if im doing yardwork or in a high noise environment
these work for what i need was not happy they was plastic that wasnt in the post and about  were broken   will not order again
i like it a lot it works perfect and the suction is excellent it cleaned a lot more than others and it is super easy to use and clean it if you leave more than  secs on the same spot it will bruise but if used properly it is really powerful i use twice a week and it is helping to keep my face out of blackheads
my daughter likes this tooth brush its small enough to be comfortable while brushing her small teeth
it has a bitter and nasty taste but it did help me get pregnant i just wished it came in tea bags and not a powder
i have been on a ketogenic diet for  years one of the problems is knowing what foods might throw you out of ketosis there is so much conflicting information and of course each body is different i have tried keto sticks but they are next to worthless although there is nothing better than a blood test to determine the level of ketones the ketone breath meter is the next best thing you cant always believe the nutrients that are listed on a package there are no regulations as to what constitutes net carbs the only way that you can tell if the food you are eating is throwing you out of ketosis is by testing your ketone level about a half hour after you eat it the ketone breath meter is an easy accurate way to do this in that way you will know for surethis little device is easy to use and seems to be consistent and accurate press a button to turn it on and wait for the  second countdown then blow into it for between  and  seconds there is an audible beep which tells you when to begin blowing and another audible beep which tells you when to stop it then displays your ketone level a reading between  and 0 indicates that you are in ketosis the first time that i used it i registered  to me this seems to be very accurate since i rarely have more than 12g of carbs each dayif you have cheat day or days then you probably will be thrown out of ketosis because of the carbs that you ate  the ketone breath meter will let you know how many days it took to bring you back into ketosis  in this way you can judge whether the cheat days are worth itthe readings on the meter are large and unambiguous it comes with  attachable mouthpieces and everything can be stored in a small convenient pouch if you are serious about a keto diet you need to know your numbers and have the proper information about the foods that you eat and the ketone breath meter is an economic and convenient way to track your ketone level
works as stated
very small and horrible generic packaging i would not give it away as a gift
i tried to wear but they hurt my feet so bad that i could hardly stand up then it cost me more to send them back than i paid for them
looks as expected does the job just fine
i like the product because i was looking for a long chain     inches i purchased  of them and they arrived in  days from china no problems after one month of use beads are copper  color blackthe product is unavailable at this time
this is the best mop ive ever owned i love the exchangeable pads and its so easy to spin out ive been using it for a few months now and its proven to be sturdy as well good quality
this is an awesome product if you havent tried it  had an issue but they corrected it right away
my mom is legally blind and this is great for her whenever she wants the time i love that i found it in spanish
i like these so much i bought  of them  we are going on a  week vacation and this is the perfect solution to all of the medications i will need to take  such a convenient size for packing and i love the patterns  i find no problem with them at all  i had one just like this previously and i loved it and it always served me very well  i know these new ones will do the same
they dont stick well not anti slipping
love how these socks feel the compression is perfect and they look great
 i got my order in  days wow i was thrilled to get it so fast i have digestive issues ibsc and this nopal eye prickly pear puree really helps it fights inflammation and reduces pain  its not overly sweet because it has no added sweetners its not mixed with other fruit juices either just the red prickly pear fruit puree  citric acid andor ascorbic acid and less than 005 grapefruit seed for freshness very easy to drink alone or in another beverage i love this nopal eye prickly pear i think its better than the high priced versions that ive tried great product and seller
this is more of a gel rather then oil i would not recommend it for massage as it absorbs too quick also doesnt really smell like chocolate
perfect set for a struggling newborn puppy even though they are single use still able to boil them to sterilize very glad to have them on hand make sure you measure properly and watch a video on how to tube feed because it can end up in their lungs definitely a life saver though
the taste is not so good it dont work as well as i like
this lash curler has  teeth  along the silicon they seem to help with after mascara lashes it separates them and gives a more natural look really affordable and does the work comes with multiple replacement which is appreciated
perfect fit
i wish it was more clear and it does sometimes slip off the vape but i did drop it and it did protect my vape perfectly
these are not soft brush heads which is what i was looking for the description made it sound like they are soft for sensitive teeth but they do fit
doctor recommended  works for me
like the size and ability to charge sound is great and multiple options is great as well love the light changing very pretty
these bars are amazing  low sugar  high protein  probiotics make you so full  sometimes i cant get through whole bar kids love this flavor too like this one better than almond one hard to find in stores  wish they sold them more places please carry through whole foods
this gum has a perfectly pleasant mint taste but it did nothing at all to curb my appetite and as you can see its expensive  save your money
these work well and do their job theyre kind if hard to breathe through but that honestly makes me feel like its working well
next purchase
sturdy construction seems like itll work a long time
i just noticed this and some other brands of carbonated beverages at whole foods in the last weeks  i stopped drinking coke and other carbonated drinks because of the high fructose corn syrup and the dense concentration of empty calories as spoken about by   this brands has smaller servings and less calories coke has  calories per  ounce serving meaning almost  calories per ounce ounces coke  calories12 ounces q kola  calories1 q kola has  calories per  ounce serving or almost  calories per ounce ounces q kola  calories8 ounces coke  caloriesan  ounce serving of coke has  more calories than an  ounces serving of q kolaa  ounce serving of coke has  more calories than an  ounces serving of q kola3500 calories in a pound of fat so that is about 1167 ounces more of q kola you would have to drink toto gain a pound of fat you would need to drink  cans of coke or  equivalent cans of q kolathat is you can drink more q kola for the same caloric priceim just saying that q kola tastes pretty good complex spicy sweet and refreshing  like cokewith about  of the caloriesplus you will drink less because the bottle arent  ounces they are  ounces though you canget  ounces cans of coke now and they are cheaper than q kolai will stick with some of these new drinks like q kola put my money into more reasonable andhealthy alternativesthat said i am trying to cut down on all soft drinks and even juice except real fresh juiced fruitsand vegetables  i find these smaller less calorie dense drinks a help in that effort and i also donot like to contribute money to cocacola that has been going on for decades knowing they aare contributing to the sickness and obesity of americans by the way q also makes a very interesting tasting ginger ale  it is sharp and spicy and abit hard for me a lightweight to take straight but on ice watered down which is how i like itits really excellent and sophisticated tasting
there is no ginseng in this this it is only benzocaine which i can buy for 00 at walmart waste of money
pmd arsenal elite inferno works great so i thought ill give pmd arsenal x inferno a tryobviously after ordering twice and the second time was the amazon representative this product thats pictured and obviously spelled differently doesnt exist

good productrecommend
the squirrel patrol wanted a tail for their flag worked great for the scouts i would recommend this to anyone in need of a tail 
i got these for a friend of mine  my friend says they work awesomely
i like the design a lot  the fabric is comfortable and has held up to hand washing  i havent tried machine washing it yet  i gave it three stars because the mask did not conform very well to my face  there were lots of gasps that let allergens in  because i can sew i was able to insert the metal strip from a disposable surgical mask into the seam without causing any damage  it conforms to my face much better now  i just think that should have been part of the original design
to short
used it for years to keep feet mooth
this is the only product ive ever bought through amazon that is very useless it only pokes a hole in your filter thats it i could do that with a pin

these werent the ones i bought before and were very cheaply made glad there were three in the pack cause i dont think the will last long
this is a really perfect room fragrance and i love the sandalwood smell and my husband does not object to the fragrance  its pleasant without being too overwhelming and is a great refresher when expecting guests it comes in a spray bottle and lasts about six months  think the price is reasonable considering it is imported
product old and packages had product coming out

easy to useworks well
i have noticed a better stream since i have been taking this supplement  not a vast improvement but a little  only benefit noticed in  weeks but that was all i was hoping for
these types of pills are hit or miss  they all depend on your body chemistry i have friends that swear by rhino brand and some by new burro thumbs up all the same company and of course tadalafil and sildenafil which none have worked for me unless the purpose was to make my sinuses feel clogged up and give me a headachefortunately after days of browsing i came upon auxilium due to its introductory price i didnt waste any time taking it and it didnt waste my time either but like most supplements the claims are always a bit enhanced themselves sure i may have had an erection that happen at the wrong time for a long period of time however these results are not consistent and what i experienced you may or may not my body reacts well to the goji despite the risk of digestive discomfort you can take one to two of these with at least a 16oz bottle of water they tend to work better with water and less risk of head ache or that stuffy feeling which i didnt get from auxilium i wouldnt say i felt  star results but at least  stars which led me to try out the product that looks almost identical to auxilium called lift  rise to your potential  slightly different ingredients and price same results
love it 
cute and nice bargain
i love this product so gentle on hands has nice smell and cleans disheswho could ask for anything more
enjoyed the brush overall nice firm bristles like i was looking for beautifully long handle my only meh moment the handle part fell out a few times it doesnt exactly snapclick in precicsely like most plastic ones at the store where you know its locked in place  it kinda fits organically so depending on how well you have it lined up how hard you shove and how well your groove is made to line up i got in there pretty good and it hasnt fallen off again but i feel like it could at anytime with use
love this
the product quality is okay not premium but not cheap it comes with one device one tube  head fairly easy to assemblemore powerful with speed adjustable  hygienic and comfortable for all types of nasal discharge
these things really work i like having my door wall open most of the time even in the winter so naturally my vertical blinds have been exposed to a long of breezes wind even this has lead to a few broken slats but these little things fix those broken slats in seconds my suggestion would be to buy the ten pack that way your covered in the future a great product
videoid7ca018e70e13a7a821c45008516c925c perfect thickness looks great on my nike air max  too bad they dont sell these black ones anymore here
complete junk do not trust this device ive personally owned several breathalyzers the best ive found is the alcohawk that i purchased from the local cvs for about  this device told me i was at 08 after  shots of fireball  jagerbombs and  beers in  hours the math on a 215lb man should put me at about ish yes i have a tolerance obviously but thats not the point i then tested it by taking a shot ashed immediately using the device the alcolhawk would be blown up 45ish this one was at  no way
i used these for a cooking competition i didnt win but these spoons were winners
ive been using chessex dice for  years and ive always found them to be well made  ive read the reviews of people that say the slightly rounded edges can make some dice lucky or unlucky by making some numbers more like than others to come up but i have never experienced that  recommended
i dont wear a bunch of makeup i pretty much only do simple eye shadow looks blush and some highlighter but still i have brushes that need to be cleaned and this cut my time down sooooooooo much i am in college so i dont have a bunch of time to allocate to the cleaning of my brushes this thing is amazing cleans the product of my brushes and you can use them immediately after because they arent left wet
as expected fresh product date perfect

the scent is very light
i had high hopes for this bunion corrector  i did not review it immediately because i wanted to see how well it performed over time  it is easy enough to use and seems to be well made  i have now used it for about a year daily without fail  i can see no change at all in my bunion  a year should be plenty of time to see at least some progress but i have seen none at all  i finally gave up
placed this in a low airflow side of my apartment not far from the front door i can tell it helps to keep the pollen and dust down i dont have to dust my black glass furniture near as often as before
totally recommend these they are thick enough to remove eye makeup  soft enough for other personal needs i would go out of my way to pick these up
these are toddler glasses wrong website description and they are scratched
id recommend for younger or people not looking for a lot out of a pre workout very gritty in texture and i had to stack with other supps to actually get what i wanted
videoid51ce99788abcae8b30587f88e1495f6c this crimper is very easy to use and had an led display that lets you know when the crimper is hot enough to use temperature goes up to c f it also comes with a glove that you can wear so you dont burn your fingers generally my hair is very hard to style and takes about  hrs to curl my hair i have to let the curling iron burn my hair  use lots of hairspray for the curls to keep form however with this crimper it took me about  mins the waves held up the whole day and i didnt have to use any hairspray such a great value when compared to my  curling iron

this is the second set of these sounds that had a damaged sound the other was from another seller but the same manufacturer so there is some very serious quality control problems there the only way i would recommend these is if you went over each and every one with your hands and a bright light and inspected them before accepting them then and only then should you consider using them be sure to go over every square mm of each one and then clean the heck out of them
read the latest reviews not the first ones listed this has a definite tumeric and ginger taste to it because those ingredients are in it its by no means flavorless it does blend very well but the only thing i can think of using it for is curry and i dont really like curry ugh
love how small the box is the design is beautiful which made me choose it in the first place i can only put one kind of pill in it which is ok with me because i take too many pills anyway lol  it fits in my purse pocket hand very easy due to the compact design

horrid idea of what a vagina should be gag bachelor party gift immediate trash can material

these are getting harder to find as halogen lamps fade out of sight these bulbs are nice replaced the bad one and stuck the others in a drawer for future use
looks good for present to daughter
i just wish they would stop this one size fits all stuff i like that you can put it from one hand on the other which is great since this way you can get one if you only have occasional pain in one hand or the other it fits quite well and works well too providing support and pain reliefthe biggest problem it is quite snug and i wish it was a bit bigger not everyones wrist is the same size and the strap that wraps around the wrist either needs to be longer or they need to have different sizes other than that this is great
these pants work really well for overnight diaper changes they are inexpensive and are a great way to bulk up your fluff supply they arent a close fit but cover the fabric well enough to prevent leaks
terrible i have size  feet these inserts were at least  sizes to small they were also paper thin spend the extra money for odoreaters or comparable
these things are great for organizing batteries this keeps them from rolling all over the place and also prevents them from draining their power inadvertently the glow in the dark versions work well and i can see them being very handy during a power outage where you need to find batteries for your flashlight my only complaint is that they dont have a bigger variety of colors to help with organization
work great

i have tried a few different kinds of silicone loofah while trying to replace the classic pouf this one by far comes closest to what i am looking for it is not flimsy the bristles are the right length to make suds and also be easy to clean off the detachable handle reaches my back easily its the right density to scrub but not upset my sensitive skin easy to recharge and the battery lasts a while would recommend trying it if youre looking for something similar wait until it goes on sale and save some 
this makes scrubbing your back so easy i wish i had this years ago no more shouting for my wife to come scrub my back which she has refused every time now i can do it on my own
holds hairy good

love this product cannot find in stores moved to the country and chiggers galore
i love the whole cd

the brush is too small for an adult perfect size for a child and vibrates well
very easy to cut yourself with these

videoidafd7efcc02fc31c5e2809800086f1e82 this is more of a beard trimmer than hair clippersmy wahl trimmer has seen its better days so i thought i would try out this hair trimmer my first impression is that it isnt the same quality as the whal the base of the trimmer is all black plastic i wish it had a little better grip like rubber to keep it from slipping out of my hand it seem to cut pretty good so far anything is an improvement at this point with my old existing trimmer it isnt terribly loud it does not have a defree turnable blade also no comb scissors or oil included the guards are a little difficult to put on at first but i think that is just because it is new  a little stiff the guards are   12mm it also come with a shaver attachment the charging cable works with a usb type plug it does included is a cleaning brush  velvet bag to store everything in i will update with how well it holds up but so far it is just an ok product
great product idea this was one of the better prices i found full price of  is high for this accessory seller provided a very fast delivery great seller to buy from
i finally found something that actually works and keep my itchy back from drying out  i am short and have short arms this gives me the ability to really scrub my back  its a keeper
this was a ripoff so much so that i am returning the product the price per tablet is about 10x more than you would pay in a store also it was unclear how few tablets would be in the box when i purchased this
tablets are really big
i gave this four stars because i wish they sold more bang for my buck  smells good and i like it
works perfectly for someone who takes many pills
lids are bulky and feel cheap the small side is very small cannot clean by hand
it heats up but only in the top part it basically keeps the back of your neck warm which isnt all that effective
i had an issue with this product and customer service resolved it promptlythank you very much
very thick socks had to throw them away felt myself unleved from the ground maybe the gelly within the socks make it hard to walk dont waste ya money unless you like the dizzy feeling when walking

very small
i have had acid reflux for years and forgot my medication when i went to london  years ago  i found a holistic pharmacy and she suggested this and i was stunned at how well it worked and i have been of meds and use this only  great find
good product but the delivery is very inconsistent up to two weeks or more
previous one looks more dark

in several medical studies with beagles and with aging rats it was shown that cognitive ability in the aging increased with this supplement ive been taking this for years and walmart decided not to stock it its more expensive to buy these two as individual bottles many sellers carry either one or the other i hope spring valley hasnt decided not to manufacture this product
its good but small
very nice synthetic shaving brush comes nicely packaged too would make a lovely gift using it with my scented bar soap in place of aerosol shaving creams ladies like to have smooth legs and underarmsthe brush is great works up a fine lather rinses out great wouldnt even consider buying a brush made of badger hair so cruel sooo unnecessarycant understand why anyone would want one try thisand be a pal to an innocent animal

although this container is for pills i bought it for my fitbit alta tracker for when i do pool aerobics  it does not leak so im sure your pills will stay dry  the chain that comes with it is also handy to wear around your neck  love this product
i bought this because it claimed to be organic and contain organic ingredients but absolutely nothing on the bottle label supports those claims the labeling shown in the ad that references organic is not any part of the product label the narrative calls this organic bubble bath sadly it doesnt appear to be either the product descriptions need to be corrected or the product label does this was a lot to pay for non organic bubble bath
other brands are much better quality
unless you have a really big head id be mindful of buying these as they are quite large also the bifocal portion of the lenses wasnt the best product was returned
this was wobbly and not safe in my opinion  i returned it and purchased a different brand that felt more secure
just what we wanted
what i was looking for
these are great glasses especially for the price clear at the top of the lens and a designated area for reading enlargement they are also very stylish
these are by far the lightest pairs of glasses ive ever owned and ive been wearing glasses for  years  the optics are great and due to their size its super easy to just let them slide down your nose a bit so that you can look over them when needed  the fact that they dont have a rim around the top makes em as easy to use as expensive progressive lenses  i got mine for doing computer work  my distance vision is fine so if im working at the computer and have the tv on i can just turn my head look over the top of the glasses and ive got the tv in focus without have to mess with the glasses  also great for reading and watching tv at the same time  they are not blue light blocking which i consider a big plus  i get tired of the tint on the blockers  my only minor complaint involves the cases  theyre very light duty  even the cheapo plastic cases would have been better  again a minor complaint  love em and highly recommend em
these glasses fit my  year old boy perfectly he does like them but i had to encourage him to use them every time he is looking at the screen he has had them for about a month dropped them sat on them and still in perfect condition a great inexpensive way to teach your kids how to care for eyeglasses in case they every need prescribed ones which are far more expensive to practice on how to care for them with your kids i tried them on myself and it immediately felt like my eyes were much more relaxed this is very protective against harmful blue lights from longterm screen use but also if you suffer from headaches this is a good thing to try i will be buying the adult version for myself 
very poor quality and poor packaging ask did not include  of the attachments in the image
i used it on my dry hair and after one section the light turned red again so i had to wait for it to reheat it happened after every single section i guess the technology with the cordless flatirons is not where it needs to be yet
love these for my business
when i ordered these they were color coded they arrived with no color coding these types of packs usually have separate compartments for morning afternoon well the compartments are there but backwards they read right to left not left to right evening is first then afternoonmoving to morning last this is for a person with dementia that has different caregivers coming in to help with meds the labeling is designed to cause confusion and subsequent mistakes in medicating the patient
i thought description said  shoe size fit maybe fits small very nice very soft cushioned feel wish they were a little closer to size  fit
love this stuff
great price for a great product they work very well
nice massager sometimes it does randomly shut off but it does get used a lot
this is refreshing drink in place of say a pop type drink something to cool you off on a hot day boone iowa

i started using this after my doctor told me i needed a hip replacement  i was in pain all the time especially during sleep hours  this unit is expensive but worth it  pain has been significantly reduced and i postponed surgery  im able to ride a bike and hike in the mountains  what was once horrible pain is now just some discomfort  my doctor thinks it is quack but my results tell me otherwise
used them to fill up with stuff from the piñatathey are of cheap quality and ripped easily
i bought this item to use for wrinkle prevention i saw the ingredient on the dr oz show i mix it with face cream after my sunscreen or at night and apply it to my current wrinkles and where wrinkles like to go then let dryforehead nose eye area around mouth cheeks neck chest it does not sting its suppose to keep the skin healthier thus preventing wrinklesdo some reseach on it i guess the jury is still out because this product is suppose to help you over time but i gave it  stars because i have hopecons this product smells very bad i mix it with face cream with a scent to cover up the smell

berry good quality

there are actually somethings i like to research when i buy them rachaa is a product that i know im going to love taking because i am a woman of a certain age and menopause is beginning to sneak up on me this product main ingredient also helps with early stage of meno although it is being sold as an upper region enhancement pill which is awesome you get two for one no more mommy sag from feeding the kids and a relief from private summers this is a  month supply only  pill a day before or after dinner its a small capsule easy to swallow the seller was quick with shipping and professionali did receive this product for my honest reviewupdatevery happy to say my aunt flow came to visit she usually stays for  days but out of nowhere it was only  days id still be taking out the trash every two hours if she was here just thought id share i know its bc of these pills the ingredients has a lot to do with aunt flow leaving so suddenly

i used to buy this when i lived in japan and i am so happy i finally found it on amazon its my favorite scent i cant wait to buy more
im pretty upset that it looks nothing like the stone in the picture not only did i order this piece because of its healing properties but also because it was truly visually appealing the stone i revived is a muddy brown color  not even remotely red super super disappointed
gives you that extra kick you need when working out
the mask strap is gathered  fits great plus they sewed black silk on eye side  gives me a very comfortable sound sleep
