i am allergic to nsaids so i used this product for its antiflamitory and wound care after my dog bit me and it worked great!  it also smells good which in my book is a plus.  there are so many essential oils out there that smell bad and that actually give me migraines because they smell so bad.  but this one does not do that so it is nice to come across ones that actually smell good.  i looked it up and discovered that rosewood does other great things like helps with depression and boosts the immune system.  it can help the skin if you have sensitive or dry or oily skin.  it can also help as a nasal decongestant.  it works as a insect repellent which is great because i do not like bugs!!! and it can be used as a perfume.  so its another essiential oil that has multiple purposes.  i highly recommend this product!,human

"if any wand developer has discovered nothing more than a way to detect and measure zero point energy it would be a nobel prize worthy accomplishment. the ability to harness and control zero point energy, let alone all the profound benefits attributed to it, would be tantamount to harnessing and controlling gravity. it would be the single greatest scientific breakthrough in human history. and there would be at least one doubleblinded, clinical study to validate it.according to amega and other wand producers, zpe somehow promotes cellular repair by ""reminding"" our cells to ""return to source"". that is, their original, undamaged, pristine state. this begs the question, why does zero point energy only contribute to repairing cells we cannot see? why does not zero point energy repair skin cells of burn victims or those with eczema, psoriasis or acne? why does not it reverse cataracts, or return the scalp cells of balding men back to ""source""? in fact, the only demonstrations we are ever presented are subjective, where the subject rates their pain from 1 to 10, and the injury is internal where we must only assume ""cellular repair"" actually took place. this is somewhat similar to charlatans like peter popoff and benny hinn who routinely heal trick hips and bad backs, but who can never seem to find any clinically blind, quadriplegic or stage4 cancer patients in their audience, in spite of the hundreds that attended.instead of demonstrating the miraculous powers of these wands on citrus fruits, old dogs or people with a headache, as you will find all over youtube, why do not they send free wands to stage four cancer sufferers who are under hospice care and have ceased all anticancer treatment? that way there would be no doubt what caused their cancer to go into remission, they could save thousands of lives and end tremendous suffering, and these wand purveyors would heroically be front page news all over the world. and there would be a multibillion dollar bidding war among pharmaceutical companies for the rights to this technology, and hundreds of new jobs created to dig the ten mile deep hole for them to bury it in.for the record, i have performed extensive research into zpe wands, specifically amega global's amwand, including blind field testing. you can read the results in the alert section of our website which you will have to search for as urls external to amazon are not allowed here.len clementsfounder  ceomarketwave, inc.",human

"i have been using neroli hydrosol on my face for years.  i saw this one for considerably less that my usual brand, and it was supposedly organic, so i figured i would give it a try. big mistake! first off, it had a weird strong scent, not a subtle neroli scent like the one i am accustomed to. i sprayed some on my face anyway, and within seconds my face was itching like nobody's business. i find it hard to believe that this is pure organic neroli hydrosol.",human

"ok look  its advertised as a flame less candle. so, thus,  i foolishly expected it to look a little bit like a candle.much like other reviewers have stated, the biggest issue i have with this is the electric plug. i cannot even create the illusion of a candle with that thing attached.the look is bad, the cord is a bad idea, and it in no way resembles a candle so much as a badly lit lamp of some sort.at least the smell is good, when you stand really close to it.do not buy this if you value your money. check out the other  any other version by any other company that does not have a cord attached. at least then you can pretend its a candle instead of some lame lamp that does not even light the area around itself enough to find the on and off switch.",human

"this is definitely not a highquality set. however, it does give you an idea on how to set up and use a gun and use the practice skin. this comes with everything you need to learn how to start tattooing, including two guns, needles, bottle for sanitizing soap soap not included, practice skin, power box, rubber bands, ink and more.this comes with no instructions on how to work these guns, so you have to google how to set this up and how to work it. which is not good if you have no idea what you are doing. i almost want to take this kit down to my local tattoo shop and ask them how to set this up just in case i have been doing it wrong, because honestly, i have zero clue. i figured out the general idea, but that was about it.out of the two guns, one arrived broken and will not turn on when hooked up. the other one stops working randomly, and i did double check and make sure that the cables were inserted fully. the guns themselves feel pretty cheaply made but look kind of cool. i do like the 34;hardy34; look they have going on.i have not used this on actual skin yet, as i am definitely not an expert, and really never touched a tattoo gun until now...but the ink did not have great results on the practice skin, so i do not think i would even attempt it on real skin, even with practiceoverall, i think this would be an okay starter kit if you are just wanting to learn how to set up a tattoo gun, and maybe tattoo the practice skins, or some fruit...but you will definitely want an upgrade if you want to tattoo skin. also, keep your fingers crossed that the guns arrive in working condition.i received this item at a discount  in exchange for my honest  review. this had no effect on my opinion of this product, and i would have said the same thing if i had paid full price.",human

"like many women out there, i have a husband with a terrible snoring problem. his snoring is so loud, he often makes it difficult for me to fall asleep, or will wake me up in the middle of the night.  i bought this product after trying other nasal strips, nose inserts, and other items recommended by friends and family.my husband is a good sport and happily put the device on before we went to bed.  after a few minutes, he quickly fell asleep and i did not hear a peep out of him!  i was so relieved!i tried the device on myself just to see if it was comfortable and would be easy to wear. the thing i noticed was that although the device was extremely comfortable, it would slide around a little on my head. not a deal breaker, but thought i would mention it anyway.if you have a snoring problem or have a spouse that does  you should really consider purchasing one of these snoring straps. it was definitely the thing that helps me get the sleep i needed.when i purchase an item, i rely heavily on the customer reviews to verify the seller's claim. therefore, i give my honest opinion so hopefully it can help others. i received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. my thoughts on this product belong to me and are in no way manipulated or influenced. if this review has been helpful to you, please click the yes button below.",human

"well, it did keep me from rolling onto my back, but i did not use it per the horrible directions.  directions are minimal.  it has a picture showing strap to chest not waist, but does not say what the benefit of chest vs waist is.  the strap is awful!  it is rigid and bulky and feels like sleeping on rocks for the most part.  first,  i am a woman and strapping this across my breasts was not appealing or comfortable.  i tried just below and the strap hurt my ribs, so i went with the obvious choice and strapped it to my waist as directions said not to do.  worked fine strapped around waist.  i was unable to roll to my back.  i will be changing out the straps as they are uncomfortable.  i want straps that have some flex and are thinner.  i do not understand how this would facilitate good breathing strapped tightly around the chest.  this was the only product i could find to keep me from rolling over, so i am grateful it was available.  however, it could be more comfortable with better straps.  the directions are probably vague to avoid making claims so the fda does not shut this down, but a bit about what the benefit of chest vs waist would have been nice especially as it is uncomfortable as directed.  it is also darn hard to inflate.",human
"582 while it kept me from rolling onto my back as intended, the directions were minimal and confusing. the strap is uncomfortable, rigid, and bulkyalmost like sleeping on rocks. strapping it across my chest was not ideal as a woman, so i opted to wear it around my waist despite the directions advising against it. the waist placement worked fine, but ill replace the straps with thinner, more flexible ones. although this was the only option i could find, it could be vastly improved with better design and clearer instructions. inflating it was also a hassle.",ai

"updatedat first i really liked these sleep masks. i had to make a small adjustment, but they seemed to work well so i gave them four stars. well, now that i have used it for a while, the red sleep mask leaves black marks from the strap all over my sheets. the black dye will not wash all the way out, so i have ruined a nice set of sheets. i do not know if this is the case with all the masks from this company or just mine. so beware when you purchase.these sleep masks are pretty good, especially for the price. you get two masks, two sets of foam ear plugs which i do not use, and a carrying case. i really like that these are contoured over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyelid. the only reason they did not get five stars is the nosepiece. i found it to be a little too wide. i had to perform minor surgery and cut out a small vshaped piece of material from the nosepiece in order to make the mask block out more light from the bottom and take pressure off the bridge of my nose. now they work great, but i probably decreased the lifespan of the masks. but for the price, i do not think that will be problem time will tell.",human
"update i initially really liked these sleep masks, but after using them for a while, the red one left black marks on my sheets, which will not wash out. the earplugs are a nice touch, and i like that there is no pressure on the eyelids. however, i had to adjust the nosepiece to make it more comfortable, and i am concerned about the longevity of the mask.",ai

"i purchased these thinking they would be like similar showershampoo brushes i have used in the past.  they are not.  these have more teeth, so when brushing your hair, the teeth do not slip through your hair quite as easily.  and they are not 'soft' plastic.also, when using in the shower, i often clip the curved 't' handle to the shower head spout.  unfortunately, these will not stay put.  they slip off after a few seconds.  the curved 't' handle was the reason i purchased this model in the first place.  most of the other models listed on amazon have either loop or grip handles that cannot be clipped to the shower downspout.lastly, i have noticed on one of these that the teeth shrank and deformed, apparently after prolonged exposure to my preferred hair care product.  this was a first for me, since i have used similar brushes for years without this happening with others, you just had to live with the teeth falling out over time.  apparently, the manufacturer felt that testing or at least researching the effects of different solvents commonly used in hair care products on the plastic used in these brush's manufacture was an unnecessary expense.  and that is entirely okay.  i will just post a lessthanenthusiastic review and never buy these again.you would think that something like a showershampoo brush would be easy to get right.  apparently not.  not recommended.",human

"this vitamin c serum comes in a thick, milky gel formula that is odorless.  it glides over my skin effortlessly and absorbs instantly.  it is comprised of a premium formula that is so powerful, potent, clean and effective that you normally only find it in highend spas.  this serum reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  the penetrating formula not only cleans and moisturizes your skin, it tightens ans smooths areas around your eyes, chin, neck and cheeks.  it works as a deep cleanser to clean out the oil, makeup and impurities from your pores so your skin reaches a healthier, more radiant look.  the hydrating formula allows your pores to 'breathe' by allowing refreshing oxygen to penetrate your skin.  it is a refreshing change from heavier creams and serums.if you read my reviews regularly, you know i have reviewed many serums, especially vitamin c serums.  for this reason, i have chosen to use this review entry to share parts of an article that was published by my awesome beauty that is titled the complete guide to vitamin c serums.how to choose the best vitamin c serum  10 factors factor 1  vitamin c formthere really is not a best form for vitamin c because there has not been that much research that shows which one is the most stable and still effective.when you are looking for vitamin c, you should stick to the derivatives or actives that are tested and proven to work, likeascorbic acidascorbic acid has the most supporting research but it is also the most unstable and can be quite irritating at higher concentrations. however, if your skin can handle it, it is the go to active. just make sure that the serum is not oxidized.still, most companies prefer to use the derivatives because they definitely have longer shelf life, which is critical for a cosmetics company.magnesium ascorbyl phosphatesodium ascorbyl phosphatemagnesium ascorbyl and sodium pretty much the same are watersoluble derivatives of vitamin c that many believe to be the best form of vitamin c for use in skin care products.they believe this because it is less irritating and is more stable than vitamin c. even better, sodium ascorbyl or magnesium phosphate has the same potential as vitamin c in helping with collagen synthesis while keeping the concentrations lower.in the end, for those who have sensitive skin or do not want redness, sodium ascorbyl phosphate is probably a better choice than ascorbic acid.still, sodium ascorbyl phosphate can still degrade when it is not stored properly or exposed to light and air. following the use by dates on the packaging is a must to ensure your get a product that still works.ascorbyl palmitatethis form is the most frequently used fatsoluble soluble in oils derivative of vitamin c in skin products.it is not irritating to the skin and is far more stable than vitamin c. still, even if it has good antioxidant properties; it does not boost collagen synthesis as much as other derivatives and vitamin c does.so, if you are going to choose an oilbased product that contains vitamin c, you want to make sure that it has ascorbyl palmitate.however, it will not be nearly as effective as ascorbic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, or sodium ascorbyl phosphate.new derivativesthese derivatives are to be avoided because there has not been enough study into their benefits.you might also find other derivatives such as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, which belong to the new derivatives that are slowly hitting the market.if you remember what we said about derivatives, check the paragraphs above, most vitamin c derivatives on the market, including ascorbyl palmitate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, consist of the ascorbic acid fragment ascorbyl and a fragment of another acid e.g. palmitate or phosphate.these new derivatives have multiple chemical fragments that are bound to a single ascorbic acid fragment that protect against the core vitamin c.so, as you can guess, it is like having more bodyguards protecting the core vitamin c.they are said to be more stable compared to the other derivatives and vitamin c itself. some of these newer derivatives particularly the tetrasubstituted lipophilic ascorbates are also said to be more powerful in boosting collagen synthesis. however, you will need to put out a little more cash, which might not be worth it just yet as we still have not found enough evidence or studies backing up those new derivatives.to simplify it, if you havenormal or oily skin use lascorbic aciddry or sensitive skin use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and redness.we will keep a close eye on the new derivatives and will update our article in 2016, so you can benefit from the most up to date information.note there are of course other derivatives such as a ascorbyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside etc... but they really lack studies to warrant use so stay away from those forms for the time being.factor 2  water based serum or oil based serumif your read carefully our previous paragraph, you should be able to answer this question.as you obviously want the most potent vitamin c serum, you will choose the most effective vitamin c forms  the oil soluble vitamin c derivative is not as effective as the water soluble ones, so you should stick with a water based vitamin c serum.you can also notice that all our top 3 vitc serums are water based because they definitely gave us better results. that is also why most vitaminc serums in the market are water based.the other advantage?these serums are much lighter and will be much easier to add in your skincare routine.as a reminder, apply the serum right after washing your face so to let the serum sink in and give you optimum results.factor 3  percentage of vitamin c in the productthe percentage of vitamin c is a tricky factor for formulators as was confirmed by our cosmetologist and formulator friend.you do need a high amount of vitamin c to boost collagen production and help with hyperpigmentation but too much can actually because irritation and redness  and you do not want to make people have the catch22 or being wrinkly or red.the goal is to find that just right spot  which can be harder than you think.the amount that you should look for depends on whether you have the vitamin c form or the lascorbic acid or the derivativesascorbic acid look for 515 in the productmagnesium ascorbyl phosphate or sodium ascorbyl phosphate percentages between 120 remember that these derivatives are as effective in lower concentrations as ascorbic acid .word to the wisewhen you are using vitamin c serums, and if your skin is pretty sensitive, you should consider starting at the lower end and work your way up to a higher concentration so that your skin is not put into shock. you could irritate your skin and make it red and inflamed. your skin may dry out and peel, which is pretty much the opposite of what you want  dry skin can make you look wrinklier, as was the case for several of our readers and 2 of our testers with sensitive skins.try to avoid pure vitamin c form, like lascorbic acid, and work with a derivative around 1.5 or 3 for the first month. that was more than enough for their skin, which showed impressive results. example here of vitamin c serum for sensitive skins.so the most important criteria is not the percentage but how much  of vitamin c your skin needs to get results and how much you skin can stand.this is a really personalized product and you need to find the right one for you  there is no one size fits all option.factor 4  ph levelswhen trying to make a decision on what serum to buy, ph levels should be one of the most important things you consider. ph levels tell you how acidic the product is  the lower the ph, the more acidic the product is.now, many people will believe that stronger concentrations of lascorbic means that the product is superior to something with a lesser amount, but that is not necessarily the case. the serum should have a ph level of 3.5 max preferably lower, or it will not be able to penetrate the skin  which is why it needs to be acidic in order to be effective, but also why it can be an irritant for some people.skinceuticals is the one that holds the patent for the lowest ce ferulic serum available on the market, it has a ph between 2.5 and 3.0. some of the more affordable brands are not that far above them though, with ph levels ranging from 3.0 to 3.5.they cannot make it the same because it will violate the patent  but it is still low enough to be effective.as for the derivatives, the ph problem does not hurt as much because they can go for a more neutral ph.for example, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate has an ideal ph around 5 or 6, which is the ph of our skin. this is why some serums that use vitamin c derivatives will come with a sensitive skin label.serums that have ascorbic acid ideal ph of around 2.0 to 3.0, which can be irritating for those with sensitive skin.serums that have sodium ascorbyl phosphate ideal ph of around 5.0 to 7.0, which should not affect sensitive skin.many brands have a problem with ph, it would seem in our testing. the products were not well formulated and the ph was not within the ideal range for the best penetration of ascorbic acid. that is why some people find vitamin c serums ineffective; they probably came accross a bad formulated serum to start with. obvioulsy, we did not keep those useless serums in our top 3.factor 5  better ingredients for effective team workvitamin c by itself can help your skin, but there is a reason that many of the best products have more than one thing in it.you cannot use one thing and expect miracles, just like you cannot eat a diet of only kale and expect to be healthy...or happy.you need a little more help, which is why it is good to go for a product that has other benefits or beneficial ingredients.look for products that offer tons of antioxidants, especially if you are trying to avoid aging.in some combinations, antioxidants can strengthen each other and go above and beyond what they can do alone.one of those additions could be hyaluronic acid, which helps to deliver moisture, which can reduce wrinkles.you could also look for aloe vera, green tea, rosehip, andor ferulic acid.having more will not hurt your skin; at worst it just will not help it, so look for a product that will be able to deliver on more than one front.update you can find serum with 20 of lascorbic acid, the most irritant form but the percentage of vitamin c is not the only criteria to check, i definitely prefer less vitamin c, like 15 of vitamin c if it means getting several other potent actives in the same serum that will boost the vitamin c action.remember also as we mentionned it previously, the higher percentage of vitamin c  l ascorbic form, the more irritant it can be.... so i know we all want the most effective serum but if you burn your skin... it is not really what you want. so be moderate and build up from there.keep in mind that usually,the more vitamin c in the serum, the less other actives manufacturers will add. to keep the production cost moderatethe less vitamin c, the more other actives manufacturers will add.  as they have more margin to add other pricey activesof course, the choice will depend on whether you use other serums or not in your skincare routine. if you only use one serum, it is usually a good move to use a serum with a blend of super actives vitamin c, acid ferulic etc... if you use other serums, you can pick the serum with 20 lascorbic acid as you will bring other actives in the battle against wrinkles with your other serumsfactor 6  skin typeseveryone has different skin types, from oily to natural to dry  and many of us have all three types at once.some people will have better results with vitamin c derivatives while others will prefer to use the l ascorbic form  it is really a testing game until you find the one that works best for you.if you have sensitive skin, a product with a high level of ascorbic acid might harm your skin and you should aim to work with a milder option.some people will be able to use only a little at a time and work up to the stronger levels, while others will be able to use the stronger products from the start. if you are having problems, a useful tip would be to start by applying the product every other day and work up from there.go by this rule of thumb when you are just starting outnormal or oily skin use lascorbic aciddry or sensitive skin use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and redness.factor 7  avoid colored productswhen you search for products that have vitamin c or any derivatives, try to find a product that is white or colourless.any colouring in the product could hide the signs of oxidation that render the product less effective.you want to be able to see a yellowish or brownish tint.of course, a lack of tint does not guarantee that your product is free from oxidation as the early oxidation stages are colorless....some unethical manufacturers they do exist.. will even add colour to their products so that you cannot spot the oxidation status  so they can even sell oxidised products without you knowing it.  and they can hide the ugly truth however, some only do this for marketing reasons  people equate orange or yellow with vitamin c, so they tint it that so it looks better.still, we recommend you avoiding vitamin c products that are not colorless or white.that way, you will be able to check the degradation status and as a result the effectiveness of your antiaging  product.factor 8  packaging  storageproducts that contain vitamin c and its derivatives have sensitivity to air andor light that makes their quality degrade at a faster rate if they are stored incorrectly.companies do their best in trying to create packaging that helps keep the products fresher for a longer time, they use opaque tubes, pumps, or air restrictive bottles.you will usually find amber dropper bottle or blue colored dropper bottle, which enables to protect the serum from light. for your information, amber colored glass is said to protect a little more from light than blue colored glass, but the difference is not that important.what you must remember is to avoid transparent bottles they cost way less for the manufacturer but it means for your vit c serum a shorter shelf life....yet, to get the best results out of your product, make sure that you close them tightly to reduce the amount of air that can get in and place them away from light.try to avoid exposing them to humidity  which means you should not store it in your bathroom. many people like to store antiaging products with vitamin c in the refrigerator! if that does not sound appealing, wrapping them in aluminium foil can help.once again, make sure that you note the use by date on the packaging  they will be your best indicator of whether or not the product still has a change of being effective.factor 9  brand reputationyep, would you buy a product from an unethical brand that does not take customer service seriously?would you even think of spending your money on a company that do not respect you as a customer?you should also definitely check the brand reputation, check whether the brand is known for selling scams or fake serums.there are unfortunately thousands of crappy brands in the internet selling you bottles of water with a simple gelling agent to make a serum that they would market as vit c serum.when customers start to complain, they simply take the money and shut down everything. then, they can create another brand and rinse and repeat....i know it sucks but that is the bad aspect of internet. as we told you, you will find thousands of vit c serums brands on amazon or other big e commerce websites, they all claim to be the best serum on earthwe bought many serums to test, and were really shocked by some brands selling crap so the big lesson to remember is to be critical....keep also in mind our reviews do not necessarily mean, your will get the exact same results as our reviewers. we all have different skin. that is why we usually like to give you the criteria and elements to know so you can better choose the most suited serum for your specific case.factor 10  pricingpricing of vitamin c products can vary greatly.some of the best products from skinceuticals are a luxury item while other brands are far more affordable. of course there are a ton of products that fall right in the middle.skinceuticals products are great, but they might not be worth the money 30 ml bottles for 100120 unless you have tons to spend and use 1 bills in the bathroom. you can definitely find cheaper serums that are as effective. on the other side, you also have the serums that cost 5 and swear to be the end of all your skin problems. those brands are created everyday, which proposes serums for  5 with 20 of vitamin c  10 of hyaluronic acid,  many other actives that are priceyyou look at the ingredients and see all of the buzzwords, so you think it has to be a miracle.well, just like fake designer bags on canal street, these products tend to fall apart at the seams and not offer the results you have been dreaming of. some of those products might claim that they are 20 vitamin c, when you open them up and get a ton of water, you will realize pretty quickly that it is not.to sum it up, you can definitely find a good serum that will deliver somewhere in the 2070 range. take advantage of sales and seasonal deals, as they pop up quite frequently.i chose to share the 10 simple criteria involved in how to choose the best vitamin c serum because i found it to be very information.  i hop you can too.  i like this serum featured in this entry because it contains sodium ascorbyl phosphate.  this is one reason why my extremely sensitive skin does not react to it.  it is also water soluble which makes it more effective and does not leave any nasty residue.  there are also other beneficial ingredients present such as aloe vera and green tea.  really, i cannot say enough about this product.i will sum it up by saying this...this serum is comparable to other better known brands as far as the ingredients and other factors.  yet, it is available at an affordable price.  why pay more for the same thing?  i also like the fact they back their product with a 100 money back guarantee.  if you are not satisfied within 30 days of purchase, return it for a noquestions asked, 100 refund.  that is a guarantee you cannot really sneeze at.i received this product at a reduced rate",human
"this vitamin c serum comes in a smooth, odorless, milky gel that applies effortlessly and absorbs quickly. it features a highquality formula that rivals those found in premium spas. the serum reduces fine lines and wrinkles, tightens, and hydrates the skin, giving it a fresh, radiant appearance. it works as a deep cleanser, removing impurities while promoting collagen production. the hydrating properties help skin ""breathe"" by allowing oxygen to penetrate. i have tried many vitamin c serums, but this one stands out for its gentle yet powerful effects. it is ideal for normal to oily skin types.",ai

this product did what it advertised.  i purchased it to put medicated lotion on my back and it works.  instead of having to deal with pads you apply the lotion directly on the end of the paddle and spread it around.  it is lightweight and easy to clean since the application part of the device is vinyl which wipes right off.  i would recommend it as a solution for those who live alone or need to be able to self applicate lotion or medication on areas that are impossible to reach on the back.  it also has a nice long handle which is a nice plus since you are able to reach all the way down your back with it.,human

"they work great. they are ear plugs. i got tired of using balled up kleenex. the only issue is the vibration noise of the cord traveling into the ear canal when it moves around while trying to study.  i have used a pair of foam plugs from work that have a plastic cord and it is quieter.i like these, though. i take the cord off to study for school. does not matter as much if i am doing yardwork or in a high noise environment.",human

"i have been on a ketogenic diet for 2 years. one of the problems is knowing what foods might throw you out of ketosis. there is so much conflicting information and of course each body is different. i have tried keto sticks but they are next to worthless. although there is nothing better than a blood test to determine the level of ketones, the ketone breath meter is the next best thing. you cannot always believe the nutrients that are listed on a package. there are no regulations as to what constitutes net carbs. the only way that you can tell if the food you are eating is throwing you out of ketosis is by testing your ketone level about a half hour after you eat it. the ketone breath meter is an easy, accurate way to do this. in that way you will know for sure.this little device is easy to use and seems to be consistent and accurate. press a button to turn it on and wait for the 20 second countdown then blow into it for between 5 and 10 seconds. there is an audible beep which tells you when to begin blowing and another audible beep which tells you when to stop. it then displays your ketone level. a reading between .5 and 3.0 indicates that you are in ketosis. the first time that i used it i registered 2.30. to me this seems to be very accurate since i rarely have more than 12g of carbs each day.if you have cheat day or days then you probably will be thrown out of ketosis because of the carbs that you ate.  the ketone breath meter will let you know how many days it took to bring you back into ketosis.  in this way you can judge whether the cheat days are worth it.the readings on the meter are large and unambiguous. it comes with 10 attachable mouthpieces and everything can be stored in a small convenient pouch. if you are serious about a keto diet you need to know your numbers and have the proper information about the foods that you eat. and the ketone breath meter is an economic and convenient way to track your ketone level.",human
"after being on a ketogenic diet for two years, i found this ketone breath meter to be the most accurate way to test my ketone levels. its easy to use and provides clear results. i can now better track whether certain foods throw me out of ketosis. its a great tool for anyone serious about keto.",ai

"i just noticed this and some other brands of carbonated beverages at whole foods in the last weeks.  i stopped drinking coke and other carbonated drinks because of the high fructose corn syrup and the dense concentration of empty calories as spoken about by .  this brands has smaller servings, and less calories.1 coke has 140 calories per 12 ounce serving meaning almost 12 calories per ounce.12 ounces coke 140 calories12 ounces q kola 105 calories1 q kola has 70 calories per 8 ounce serving or almost 9 calories per ounce.8 ounces q kola 70 calories8 ounces coke 93 caloriesan 8 ounce serving of coke has 24 more calories than an 8 ounces serving of q kola.a 12 ounce serving of coke has 36 more calories than an 8 ounces serving of q kola.3500 calories in a pound of fat, so that is about 1167 ounces more of q kola you would have to drink toto gain a pound of fat you would need to drink 25 cans of coke or 33 equivalent cans of q kola,that is you can drink more q kola for the same caloric ""price"".i am just saying that q kola tastes pretty good, complex, spicy, sweet and refreshing ... like cokewith about 75 of the calories.plus you will drink less because the bottle are not 12 ounces, they are 8 ounces, though you canget 6 ounces cans of coke now and they are cheaper than q kola.i will stick with some of these new drinks like q kola put my money into more reasonable andhealthy alternatives.that said i am trying to cut down on all soft drinks, and even juice, except real fresh juiced fruitsand vegetables.  i find these smaller less calorie dense drinks a help in that effort, and i also donot like to contribute money to cocacola that has been going on for decades knowing they aare contributing to the sickness and obesity of americans. by the way q also makes a very interesting tasting ginger ale.  it is sharp and spicy and abit hard for me, a lightweight, to take straight, but on ice watered down, which is how i like itit's really excellent and sophisticated tasting.",human
