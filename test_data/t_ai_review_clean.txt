if youre in the market for phytoceramides look no further ive tried several brands but this one stands out as the best my experience has shown that products from utah tend to be of superior quality and this one is no exception
the instructions mention a handle multiple times but fail to clearly identify or illustrate it also while its supposed to include two dental cases mine only came with one still the fit was adequate given the price
very poor quality the material is itchy and the craftsmanship is lacking the item started falling apart almost immediately and to make matters worse its nonreturnable strongly advise against purchasing

these are simple effective and compact they work well with most masks that dont have particularly thick ear loops bonus theyre reusable when paired with disposable masks

this was a sturdy ice scraper mine previously had a broken handle so i was pretty happy with a new one this was great because not only does it scrape ice off my car but it also extends mine before hadnt done that overall im quite content with my purchase
very unsatisfied with product no type of suction and it keeps cutting off i will be returning it
cute cover but as we found out  there are a lot of different samsungs out there so this didnt fit our fault find one for your specific model
its just not what it says it is and that is all sadly and disappointing
bitter bitter bitter i still drank it in different ways hot cold in different rooms lol i did not receive a relaxed feeling i do not foresee me purchasing this product again
could have sworn i could return this if i purchased through amazon total waste of money smells awful waste of money
i love these they are so much better than i anticipated
these are great 7day pill boxes they come apart to fill with pills once back together the button in the middle spins by one day with each press the little dispenser drawer flips down so you can just dump the pills in your hand very nice lightweight plastic but good quality its a little thicker than i expected so my jewelry part use wont work but i now have colorcoded pill boxes for family travel

works great keep them in the car for after car washes
the three stars are not for the pool itself which is pretty awesome but since the company that sells it plumstruck deserves zero stars i compromised and used three other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue but since the description specifically mentions a ladder i thought the problem was fixed when amazon and i both contacted plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool plumstruck repeatedly ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included since the pool is useless even dangerous without the ladder this issue must be addressed by the ad that being said amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price so if the company would just change their wording people could figure all of this out in advance amazon is investigating the company so hopefully all of this will change some people mentioned a heater but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description i was actually worried it would only work with the heater and i didnt want to have to use a  outlet so i was relieved that it doesnt have one if i decide i need a heater later i will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation i will never order anything through plumstruck again they are a horrible company if you can find this pool through someone else i recommend it it is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workout i also want to add that amazon sells a saltwater conversion system that my local pool store also sells for a lot more money that the pool representative says will work with this pool so i will soon be able to convert it to saltwater
perfect storage case to encase the massager and long plug
these are billed as medium toothbrushes they are super soft like little kid toothbrushes i dont even feel like they are cleaning my teeth no bristle shedding observed tried two of the pack so far the head and handle are a little rough but i didnt experience any splinters but if your mouth is so sensitive you need this level of softness in a bristle the wood might be too much for you
i never thought id order a broom online but years ago i bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom i had ever used i have never found another since then that even comes close i even replaced the old handle when it broke so i could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones i could find locally so i came online to see if i could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after years of hard use and lo and behold amazon had one i paid significantly more for this one than i did my original one and its worth every penny this one is bigger i originally had the  the reason i like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it id repurchase this several times over happily it has made me a broom snob lol 
i dont actually know if these work or not because they are so thick that my feet wont fit into any of my shoes if i put these into them first
these diapers if you get the bundle packs off of honestcom will cost you as much as the organic diapers bought off the shelf the difference is that these diapers hold sooo well my son was breastfed the first  months and breastfed babies poo a lot and its always runny never had a leak organic diapers along with organic wipes and creams have been the only thing that has helped my son and his super sensitive skin i highly recommend the whole honest baby line
stands up great on solid floors it is also flexible making it very easy to use gives the added stability needed in a way thats not as bulky as most i love it
loved these they were perfect for my wedding pies and my guests loved them
i love it smells so earthly this stuff gives me so much energy i recommend
good masks fit well liked the assurance of the filters
dont think that they are real propolis or worth it
i just saw that one of them is already expired i purchased this on april  2018 the box was expired on jan 2018
perfect size to grip its soft but not too soft easy to clean
lot  has a funky mixture its different than the usual formula i hope it is safe and as the label states the last shipments have had this lot so im wondering if this is the last supply of this product since it seems to be out of stock most places
a little heavy but its great
gets bugs off easy and the bike stayed looking clean very few bugs stuck after using it
i really wanted this to work out and i was originally excited when i first started using this i was surprised after charging how quickly the battery died and now it will not charge after only one use my poor dog looks goofy because half their body was cut fur was only a couple of inches and well brushed i will be returning because i am very disappointed
been using this for a while on my daughter and no rash at all she can use this product without reacting thank god its the only thing with a scent that she can use
product is a little small so if you order and want a snug fit you might want to go up a size
smells wonderful this is our second bottle
large amount works great for saltwater fly patterns only thing id like to see is a pure white color other than that its perfect
collagen is a part of my daily routine usually in coffee since coffee is part of my daily routine each packet has  calories and 9g of protein all from cow collagen peptides unflavored so nothing to interfere or overly sweeten pricier than similar collagens and the serving size is larger than some others as well still these are convenient packets for on the go the packets are thoughtfully designed very easy to open no scissors needed
always disappointed when you find out they lie about their size lol this is not  inches more like  this is definitely a mini massager
this battery is even better than the original batteries that came with my hearing amplifier so far lasting from  am to  pm well see how long it takes to start running down faster great buy
this stuff is the absolute bees knees i only couldnt give it  stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted so about  of it was already spilled out the product itself worked amazingly my hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job and even with gloves on the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands nails and nails bed area in filth i always seem to get black stains stuck to my skin and the dirt and grime doesnt want to come off without a lot of scrubbing but when i tried this product i just applied a small amount to my hands scrubbed and it cleaned my hands right up without a lot of effort the best hand cleaner ive used in a long time and ive used a ton of them its got a pleasant scent too please dont send out damaged containers again though
this seems like a nice product however as far as keeping it off my vanity  it is so large that it really takes up more space than expected still keeping it though
this small bottle has been a great help in easing my tension and nervousness i appreciate that its made from allnatural ingredients with no harmful chemicals or side effects im a big fan of many bach remedies and this one is no exception
the brush works well though its slightly shorter than expected it was a bit messy at first with some fibers shedding but overall its the best option for my needs i needed something that could fit through a narrow bottleneck and preferred to avoid animal bristles for ethical reasons
these are definitely my goto masks they fit my face perfectly and are incredibly comfortable highly recommend
unfortunately these didnt work for me they kept slipping off my face which made them uncomfortable to wear
i had to return these as they werent usable in the shower the box clearly stated not waterproof which made them unsuitable for my needs
this is without a doubt the best film ving rames has ever been a part of his performance was extraordinary totally out of the box compared to his usual roles the way he portrayed a gay drag queen showed an incredible depth of empathy and understanding deserving of recognition even if this particular film doesnt qualify for an award
absolutely love it
i bought this at walmart for  for a  oz bottle great price
unfortunately i cant use the cover for storing or travel as it doesnt fit securely and it doesnt sit properly on the base the bamboolike popsicle stick is also a bit of a letdown might return it
i love the design of the pouring spout  its easy to pour quickly and the attached measuring cup is very convenient
after reading numerous frustrated reviews about digital bathroom scales i can confidently say this one is an exception it provides consistent readings varying by no more than 0 lbs and often stays exactly the same each time its a reliable scale and worth the investment
this card feels premium perfect for professional settings i will continue buying them and the sympathy cards are a great value too
lcarnitine is an excellent supplement for overall health
i was looking for latex insoles because i love the comfort of latex bed pillows and have used them in some naot shoes before these insoles were just as comfortable but the size options were limited my toes didnt fit perfectly in my shoes but the rest of my foot felt great i would buy another pair
great product and fast shipping thanks so much
i love this leavein treatment ive been using it for years and it smells amazing
