"no complaints about these replacement brush heads. the bristles are a medium soft  a bit harder than the braun ultra soft, but not as firm as the regular heads. although i prefer an ultra soft bristle, these have not irritated my gums even though they are a bit firmer than i normally use.they fit fine on my oral b, without needing to force them on or have them be too loose. the fit is as good as the oral b heads.these are packaged very well. each brush is individually sealed in a plastic wrapper, plus it has a plastic cap to keep the bristles from deforming while they are in storage. the set of 8 come in a cardboard box. it is a much better way of packaging them than the usual blister packs for both ease of use, as well as protectionkeeping them sanitary while they are in storage for use.all in all, a good alternative to the brand name brushes.",human

i drank this yesterday as directed on the side of the container and i seemed to have more energy than i thought i would at my evening tennis practice.  i had worked out pretty hard using the tennis ball machine earlier that day and was kind of dragging before tennis practice time.  i drank a full 8 oz of water with one scoopful of gen one nutritionintramino intraworkout bcaa amino acids powder and i really did feel pretty good and played well at practice.  i was not even very tired when i got home and our coach had us doing conditioning drills.  the flavor was sort of coconutlike and sweet.  i wish it was not so sweet but it seems that most of these type powders just load up on sweetness.  it dissolved well in water and i did not see any clumps.  i like this but will have to add some lemon juice to it next time to tone down the sweet.,human

"this is an excellent product with great health benefits. here is what it does if you are unfamiliar with ithow forskolin worksforskolin acts primarily by activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which results in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp in cells. cyclic amp belongs to a class of substances known as 34;second messengers34; and is one of the most important cellregulating compounds. among its many roles, camp activates numerous other enzymes involved in diverse cellular functions. hormones and neurotransmitters also activate adenylate cyclase, but forskolin appears to be able to activate adenylate cyclase by itself. thus, forskolin can increase cyclic amp without the assistance of hormones or neurotransmitters.effects of cyclic amppincreased cellular cyclic amp results in a broad range of physiological and biochemical effects, including inhibition of platelet activation resulting in decreased likelihood of blood clots, reduced release of histamine resulting in decreased allergy symptoms, increased force of contraction of the heart, relaxation of the arteries and other smooth muscles, increased thyroid function, and increased lipolysis fat burning.a number of diseases are characterized, in part, by decreased intracellular levels of cyclic amp. these include asthma, eczema, psoriasis, angina, obesity and hypertension. in addition to its adenylyl cyclasestimulating actions, forskolin also appears to have actions that are not due to this mechanism, but are due to its ability to alter a number of membrane transport proteins.asthma and allergiesmany drugs used to treat asthma and allergies are designed to increase camp levels. usually they inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase that breaks down camp. this mechanism is the 34;flip side34; of forskolins ability to act directly to increase camp. thus, forskolin can be used by itself, or in addition to phosphodiesteraseinhibiting drugs in the prevention and treatment of many allergic conditions, including asthma.forskolin is an effective smoothmuscle relaxer, resulting in bronchodilation, decreased airway resistance, and increased vital capacity and forced expiratory volume, which are important indicators of pulmonary function. forskolin also has tremendous antispasmodic action on various smooth muscles in the body, making it useful to relieve intestinal colic, uterine cramps, painful urination, angina, and hypertension.cardiovascular effects of forskolincoleus forskohli has traditionally been used to treat hypertension, congestive heart failure, and angina. treating these conditions may be among the most useful uses for forskolin. forskolin's basic cardiovascular action is to lower blood pressure, while simultaneously increasing the contractility of the heart. this is believed to be due to forskolin's campelevating ability, which results in relaxation of the arteries, and increased force of contraction of the heart muscle. one study involved seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a particularly difficult condition to treat. forskolin administration dramatically improved left ventricular function and overall cardiovascular performance.forskolin also increases cerebral blood flow, indicating that it may be beneficial in cerebral vascular insufficiency and in enhancing poststroke recovery. the platelet aggregationinhibiting effects of forskolin also add to its value in cardiovascular disorders.glaucoma and increased intraocular pressureglaucoma is a because of visual loss characterized by nerve damage usually associated with increased intraocular pressure, loss of visual field, glare, and sometimes pain. it is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. unfortunately, there is very little in the armamentarium of alternative health care practitioners that is effective in preventing or treating this poorly understood condition. however, a number of studies have shown that topical application of one percent forskolin eye drops resulted in significant decreases in intraocular pressure for up to five hours. researchers believe that it is the campelevating effects of forskolin that result in this significant improvement. unfortunately, no commercial forskolin eye drops have been developed at this time. although clinical experience is limited, oral forskolin appears to offer significant potential for sufferers of glaucoma or intraocular hypertension, and may be a major advance in the nondrug treatment of this condition.psoriasispsoriasis is characterized by a relative decrease in camp compared to another second messenger, cyclic guanine monophosphate cgmp. this imbalance results in a tremendous increase in cell division. in psoriasis, cells divide about 1,000 times faster than normal. forskolin helps to alleviate psoriasis by normalizing the camp cgmp ratio. it should be noted that fumaric acid, by itself, is highly effective in the prevention and treatment of psoriasis. however, forskolin and evening primrose oil may both be considered as additional substances to be added to a regimen to treat this particularly vexatious disease.depressiondepression is believed to be due to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brainmost commonly either serotonergic inhibitory or dopaminergic stimulatory. the response to various antidepressants depends on which neurotransmitter system has deviated farthest from the 34;norm.34; if the serotonergic neurotransmitters are most deficient, serotonin precursors like 5htp or ltryptophan, or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssri like paxil, prozac, or zoloft are most likely to be of help. if the dopaminergic i.e., catecholamines like epinephrine or noradrenaline neurotransmitters are deficient, catecholamine precursors such as the amino acids lphenylalanine or ltyrosine, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as gerovital gh3 or deprenyl are most likely to help.german scientists have been working with a different approach to elevating catecholamines, using a class of drugs that stimulate both the presynaptic as well as the postsynaptic components of catecholamanergic transmission. this novel approach uses a drug, rolipram, which acts by increasing camp an action similar to that of forskolin, and inhibiting phosphodiesterase. although the researchers stopped short of recommending forskolin for the treatment of depression, they stated clearly that 34;elevated brain camp levels are closely linked to antidepressant activity in animal models of depression.34;weight lossin vitro studies show that forskolin stimulates lipolysis breaking down of fats in fat cells. additionally, scientists at the penn state university college of medicine have found that many obese people have lower than normal camp production. based on these findings and in vitro studies, scientists theorized that forskolin might be an effective weight loss agent, especially for those with impaired camp production. a recent small study appeared to confirm this conjecture. six overweight women took 25 mg of forskolin 250 mg capsules of 10 percent standardized forskolin extract twice daily for eight weeks. at the end of the eightweek trial, the participants lost a mean of ten pounds, and reduced their percentage of body fat by nearly 8 percent. blood pressure levels also trended lower during the trial. these preliminary results indicate that forskolin may be a safe, useful adjunct to losing weight and maintaining normal body composition.hypothyroidismforskolin also has demonstrated the ability to increase thyroid hormone production and stimulate thyroid hormone release. this mechanism of stimulating the thyroid to enhance metabolism may be one way in which forskolin promotes normal body weight. forskolin's effects in normalizing thyroid function may also contribute to its antidepressant effects, as depression is a common feature of hypothyroidism.cancer metastasesscientists at brown university confirmed that forskolin is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, as well as being a potent inhibitor of tumor colonization in mice. they suggested that forskolin could find a place in the prevention of tumor metastases.immune enhancementforskolin also exhibits potent immune system enhancement by activating macrophages and lymphocytes.dosagebased on the human studies for weight loss, 50 to 100 mg of forskolin taken in divided doses during the day appears to be a safe, effective dose for the conditions discussed above.",human
"forskolin is a powerful supplement with numerous health benefits. it works by increasing cellular camp, which can have positive effects on various conditions like asthma, heart issues, weight loss, and more. it also helps regulate blood pressure, boost heart function, and even aids in fat burning. for those dealing with obesity or thyroid issues, forskolin might be a helpful addition to your health regimen.",ai

"this functions well as daylight alarm. it is best feature is that the led's arc out over the bed and shine down, as opposed to other models which shine straight out horizontally, which means you have to be on your side facing the lamp when the alarm goes off or else the light will not actually reach your eyes and wake you up. and the head on this lamp swivels, which makes it even better for increasing the chance the light will be pointing at your eyes when the alarm turns the light on. so, of the 3 models of daylight alarms i have tried, this one wins hands down in actually waking me up with the light.but this lamp has the absolute worst user interface imaginable. zoom in on the control panel in the main picture and look at the controls. now guess how you turn the alarm on on sunday night and off on friday night. go ahead, guess  i will wait.did you figure it out? no, of course you did not. because it is completely unfigureoutable. to turn the alarm on or off, first press and hold the top left button which, mysteriously, has two overlapping squares until the border around the top left indicator icon in the display starts flashing, then let go. then press and release the same button again to make the border around the next indicator icon down start flashing. then press the second button on the left which looks like a gear to make that second icon either start or stop flashing flashing means the alarm is enabled, not flashing means the alarm is disabled. then wait 1530 seconds for your change to take effect. could you ever possibly have guessed that from looking at the controls? absolutely not. why does not it just have an 34;alarm on  off34; switch? seriously. what on earth were they thinking?want to know what time the light will turn on in the morning or, more accurately, at what time the light will be at full strength? care to guess by looking at the controls  panel? do not bother. because you cannot tell what time the alarm's set for without setting the alarm time. care to guess how to set the alarm time? do not bother  you will literally never guess.i could go on, but you get my point. i use this every weekday as my alarm, because, at least at the time i bought it july 2014, it was the only daylight alarm that allowed me to direct the light towards my eyes in the likely event that i am not lying on my side directly facing the lamp at 630 am. but if you buy this, be prepared to read the user manual a few times. and definitely keep the manual next to the light for a month or so until you get used to using the absolute worst user interface ever conceived for an alarm clock. oh, and be patient. very patient. because just turning the alarm on or off, which should happen with the flick of a switch, instead takes at least half a minute.",human
"this daylight alarm is effective at waking me up. the led light arcs over the bed, ensuring it reaches my eyes even if i am not facing the lamp. the swivel head is a nice feature for directing the light. however, the user interface is confusing, making it frustrating to set up. the process to turn the alarm on and off is unnecessarily complicated and not intuitive at all. its a shame because the lamp works well once its set up.",ai

"i have already used a few of these towels to clean my air fry oven and dual microwave convection oven that were in need of cleaning, and it did a wonderful job. my air fry oven and microwave look brand new again. but, this is not the main reason that i wanted them.a while back, i took on the endeavour of repainting my kitchen and bathroom cabinets. i thought it was going to be a simple job, but it turns out that there is a lot more to it than just a little sanding and painting. it is taking me a while, i am only halfway through, and i am on a little break right now, but will be back at it within the next week or so. these towels are going to be great for all the chemicals i am going to have to use, and all the scrubbing and cleaning i am going to have to do. especially, in the bathrooms, as i have not done any of the prep work in those two rooms, yet.i am trying to go off memory of the proper steps, so i may miss something. you have to clean your cabinets with a strong special cleaner, then lightly sand them, and then reclean with a 5050 mixture of water and denatured alcohol. you also have to keep ammonia on hand for some reason, but i cannot remember exactly why. this might not be everyone is way, but this is just how i was taught to do it, and it is working well. the job was taxing on me because i did not have good towels to use. i was using a sponge and paper towels for a good part of it, and they just were not cutting it. i think there is something in the makeup of these towels that make them clean better and will make my job of prepping my cabinets a lot easier. i will also need them to wipe away any sanding dust in between coats, and these will leave them lintfree, unlike paper towels.just from using a few of these to clean my air fry oven and microwave, i know there is some super special cleaning power in these towels. i know that they will serve me well while doing my cabinet painting jobs. because of how durable they are and well they last, i am sure i will have some left over to do other cleaning jobs around the house. i definitely recommend these towels!",human

"i have been consuming fulvic and humic acids pretty much daily for the past couple of years in a shilajit form, which is dark, sometimes very thick and it never tastes good by itself.  so, when i saw trace minerals humic and fulvic acid on my list of items i could review i wanted to try it.  i have purchased several trace mineral product before, mainly their concentrated trace mineral drops and have found them to be very good quality.  i think this trace mineral liquid gut health is a very good product and delivers some fulvic and humic acids that are so good for health and so rare to find in the basic american diet.  this is not as concentrated as what you get in shilajit, but it is a big bottle, one teaspoon is the daily dose, and it has no flavor.  it tastes like water.  i think this is a very good supplement though i do not know if it will help with gut health or not but is still a healthy supplement. shilajit can be very expensive a couple of hundred dollars depending on the quality but it contains a lot of trace minerals.  but for a much less expensive substitute i think the trace minerals is a good choice.",human
"after using fulvic and humic acids in shilajit form for a while, i decided to try trace minerals' version. while it is not as concentrated as shilajit, the large bottle and flavorless nature make it a good, costeffective supplement. though i cannot say for sure if it improves gut health, i find it to be a valuable addition to my routine.",ai

"as a person with a 40year history of allergies, i honestly consider myself an expert on tissues.  in fact, i generally opt for paper towels as my goto tissue simply for their durability i generally do not care about the texture or feel.  i found the kleenex expressions to be a refreshing approach to the standard box of tissues in that they not only holdup when used, they have silky texture that glides the tissue across the skin.what makes these tissue stand out?my constant need for having a tissue or ten on hand at any given moment has led to a more unconventional approach ... using paper towels.  the main reasons why i have opted for such a heavy duty approach are that most every tissue i have ever used presented three issues i could not stand  1 they easily blew apart and created a mess, 2 they had little to no absorption quality and 3 they were super dry and always left tissue dust on my upper lip especially if i did not shave that day.  a paper towel was so much easier to deal with, especially if you could not readily throw the tissue away after use.the kleenex espressions is a big step in the direction i was looking for in a tissue as all three of my issues are simultaneously addressed with this product.  first, the tissues are not dry at all and leave no paper remnants on my upper lip after use.  coconut oil and aloe are infused into the tissue and generate a silky feel that is not moist, but not dry.  the tissue glides across the skin smoothly and does not leave any residue.  additionally, the constitution of these tissues allows them to be stronger and more absorptive that most tissues i have previously used.  in other words, they do not blow apart and generate a nasty mess after use.while i am still reliant on my paper towel square as a standard pocket handkerchief, for those with less heavyduty needs, the kleenex expressions with the lotion infused in the tissue offers a high degree of comfort and durability.  for the common cold or sinus infection where constant tissue use turns your nose raw, this tissue would certainly be my recommendation.",human
"as someone with a long history of allergies, i can confidently say these kleenex expressions tissues are a gamechanger. they do not tear easily, absorb well, and are infused with coconut oil and aloe for a silky smooth texture. they are strong, absorbent, and gentle on the skin, making them my top choice for everyday use.",ai

"not my first ""real silk"" sleep mask. in short light, breathable, not hot, blocks light, good adjustable fit, super silky, does not dehydrate skin, is gentle on skin no rubbing, dragging. cozy plush feel. good stitching, nicely packaged.i rate this primarily on my experience. i do not factor price in. prices fluctuate, there are coupons, everyone has different budgets, preferences, and so on. you decide if it is worth it. this is actual silk and there is a price tag that goes with it. not everyone wants a polyester dupe. not everyone wants low level silk that feels like polyester. if you have no preference, then there are some lovely low level momme silk options, as well as some nice polyester satin options for fraction of price. this is for those that want actual silk rip silkworms.  that being said, i have used a wide variety of eye masks of different materials and styles. here is my take on thisit feels light and lush. very soft and silky. i am privvy to the look, feel, performance of various textiles including various silk levels. this is 25 momm and feels like it. i do not question that at all.silk is nice for any skin, but is particularly gentle on delicate skin or skin easily irritated. it is breathable, and it does not dehydrate already dry skin. i notice that my skin is less parched when i use silk versus low end polyester. that is material that is smashed up against my skin for 8 hours each night. i would prefer to not have material that is rough and drags against my skin. same can be said for pillow cases and my hair. though i do keep other styles at my bedside, i always come back to silk.  i happened to be in need of another real silk mask because i accidentally washed and dried my trusty silk mask and it shrunk significantly note to self hand wash, air dry..the fit is good for me. generous size which is nice for my wide face and big nose. plenty of elastic and the adjustment option allows it to be as loose or snug as i desire. i find that it blocks light from every angle. i normally do not mind a little light to seep through so long as i do not notice while my eyes are closed. but this blocks it all out for me. i had to lift an edge to see if the tv was still on my hubs will watch tv in bed with sound offcaptions on. i could not tell. come morning, i pushed the mask up a little so as not to accidentally sleep all day.not hot. some masks really trap heat. this is breathable. again, function of the material used. of course any material can block light. so it comes down to your needs and preferences.nicely packagedat time of review, this was 35 with 30 coupon. while i do not rate on price except for in the rate features section, which i give 3 stars, i will comment that 35 is the ceiling for nearly all 2225 momme silk eye masks. if you can get it in the 20 something range, then that is reasonable.",human
"this is my second ""real silk"" sleep mask, and it meets all my expectations. it is light, breathable, and does not because any discomfort. it blocks out light effectively, offers a comfortable fit, and feels gentle on my skin without dehydrating it. while price may vary, i find the quality of this mask worth it. the silk material is particularly kind to delicate skin, and i appreciate how it feels against my face. i have tried other materials, but i always return to silk. it fits comfortably on my face and blocks out light from every angle. its not too hot, either. overall, i am pleased with my purchase and recommend it for anyone who values highquality silk.",ai

"i have been using probiotics for years and have appreciated the benefits. this version did not offer any significantly different benefits in terms of probiotic activity for me, but it does come with one big plus they taste great!i normally use pills for probiotics since the chews i have tried were not all that appealing in terms of taste. these are much different  they are round balls about the same size as a typical malted milk ball. it has a waxy coating so it does not melt in your hand. the dark chocolate taste is excellent. it does not have the same texture as actual chocolate it is a bit more grainy, but it is very tasty.probiotics are great to keep everything running smoothly in your gut, and this is the best tasting option i have come across. the only downside is that the cost per dose is higher than many of the capsulebased probiotics. still, it is a great way to encourage probiotic usage since taking one can be considered a treat rather than a chore, and easily earns this 5stars.",human

vitamin e oil is great for helping to prevent scars. i have used this oil on my face and on my arm. it seems to help cat scratches heal faster. it is thinner than a straight e oil from a capsule. it is more liquid because it has coconut oil and jojoba oil in it. it is easy to apply with the dropper that is included. this bottle will last you a long time! it is nice to know this is organic and healthy for your skin.the rebecca review,human

"the best part of this mop and bucket system is the mop handle. it is stainless steel! it is super sturdy, andit it long enough 49"" for me 5'10"" to hold comfortably. if you need it shorter, remove one section and it will be 38"".i can really push into the floor without worry of this pole breaking.each section screws on. it comes with two cleaning pads.the bucket it as pictures tall and thin. does not take up much space in terms of storage. i have not knocked it over yet, but i am aware that it could due to its tall center. it is a nice change from peeling the pads off and rinsing them by hand.micro fiber pads are pretty standard. they work the same as any of my others. just presses on or peels off. easily interchangeable.you can access the interior of the bucket for in depth cleaning and drying of the bucket, if need be by popping out the handle. then the rest can pop out. the bucket is surprisingly sturdy as well. it is not a cheap feeling system at all.the swivel mop portion is magnetic, so it will store as one long pole. also makes it easier to use the bucket as you will not have a mop head impeding quick insertionoverall i am impressed. i am most excited for the metal pole. i am not used to using a bucket, do not feel i need one..  but this is neat to have. again, i have not knocked it over. it seems to be well balanced. it works as described! i have 2 big labs and lots of sandy soil that gets tracked in with them, so floor sweeping, vacuuming, and washing is a regular chore.",human

"the consistency is a decent mix of moist and thickchewy, close enough to a real brownie. the taste is unique. it has a fairly distinct sweetness that stands out, and will be a deal killer for some. with low sugar and about double the protein as compared to fats, the macro nutritional count is good. if you are used to sacrificing taste for nutritional value you will probably be used to these trade offs; if you are looking for an actual brownie you will be disappointed. personally id rate the eat me guilt free nutty monkey brownies as better, if you are looking for a snack that does not disrupt your macros.",human

"my usually very happy 1 year old had a fever and hated our old thermometer used in the armpit.the pediatrician told me that at this age, she should use the ear thermometer for the best accuracy, so we got this one. it is so easy to use, i wonder why we ever used anything else! the doctor said to pull on her outer ear a bit and point toward her cheekbone angled towards the front, and slightly up.  not only was the reading accurate, but it was so fast that i did not have to worry about my daughter getting squirmy at all.bonus is that my trekkie husband calls it a phaser, and he and my daughter have a lot of fun using it.",human

"i have been experiencing a lot of neck pain lately and was excited to try this tens machine to see if it would help.  i am happy to report that it feels great and my neck feels better during treatment and for a few hours after treatment.  i use this machine most frequently at night, a couple of hours before bed.  it feels great on my muscles and provides pain relief.  i am trying to avoid using medicinal pain relievers.  my doctor said that i have a bit of arthritis in my neck and that poor posture is exacerbating the pain.  i have been trying to be more aware of my posture and while that helps, this tens machine provides extra relief on bad pain days.i found this machine easy to set up and begin using.  the manual made little sense to me though and i had to figure out how to set it up on my own.  i used a tens machine many years ago, so i had a base of past knowledge to understand the set up, but it is not enough for people new to these machines.  as of the time of writing this review, the manufacturer has added a video showing how to set up the device.  i wish the video contained verbal or captioned instructions.  it is just music now, so if the manufacturer is reading these reviews, please add caption to the video!",human

"this germguardian gg1000 pluggable uvc sanitizer and deodorizer seems to be a designer model of the  that i have used successfully for a couple of years.  the pluggable guardian air purifiers do remove most of the kitchen cooking odors tiny grease globules in particular that escape the air guard feature on my oven.this shapely air purifier runs more quietly than my rectangular version, though motor noise may be determined by the motor in individual devices.  the motor was louder in my second rectangular device than it was in the first.  the fans run constantly in these air purifiers, but they do not seem to require a lot of electricity.the air purifier will operate in the up, down, or sideways position, so you do not need to be concerned about the orientation of your household electrical outlets.  the purifier plug does not have a third prong for grounding, though it has wide and narrow prongs like most modern safety plugs.  the purifier covers only one outlet in a twoplug wall outlet, so the second outlet remains available for general use.my first pluggable germguardian lasted well beyond the oneyear warranty period.  these little air purifiers do not seem to require maintenance beyond replacing the uv bulb when it burns out the blue light on the purifier will go out.  the bulbs are easy to replace, but you should never look directly at a pluggedin uv bulb with the purifier cover open, because this can permanently damage your eyes.",human

"this is the 31st bp monitor that i have tried and ordered through amazon either via purchase or the vine program and is a basic monitor. almost every single monitor takes my bp within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. this one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. note that i did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. after the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. it averages the bp after three successful bp readings but the average recall is not marked as an average. most monitors identify an average with the average notation. it has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  there is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. there are two power options available and included and that is four aaa batteries or via a usb type c cable. time settings are in the 24hour clock military time only. voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy chinese accent.included in the package one bp unit one bp user manual and one digital pamphlet one large cuff one carry pouch one usb type c cable and 4 aaa batteriesfeatures up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory. date and time settings are available in 24hour clock only. setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual. the lcd display readout is large for easy reading. the cuff is 22 to 42 cm 8.66 to 16.535 inches, which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese. clearing all the bp settings is just a matter of holding the mem button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until all ee appears. the display is large. accuracy is errs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable. switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. press and hold the set button when power is off, wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press mem to switch to the other user. it displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such. the date and time settings are not remembered after the power is removed but the bp numbers are remembered   i tested after one minute of battery removal. it has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female chinese accent. it has an irregular heartbeat indicator.negatives the accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5star monitors. the average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the average indicator. the voice option is moderated by a heavy female chinese accent.this is an acceptable bp monitor. operation and setup of this unit is simple once i read the manual. to take my blood pressure, i affixed the cuff around my left arm with my palm turned up. i made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. then i pressed start and after a little bit, i had my reading. i pressed stop to turn off the unit. the systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. the big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. it is important for a user to learn how to take their bp to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. there are many great videos online that can help teach this.in summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. the cuff is large enough for most people and the lcd display is large and easy to read. it displays an average after three readings but that is not marked. the voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. there is an irregular heartbeat indicator.  the current price is not listed but any price at 24 or below would be reasonable for this.for those who are interested, i attached some notes about the other monitors i have tried.  this is known as the gold standard of bp monitors and one i purchased a few months ago on amazon. it stores 100 readings between 2 users. unfortunately, it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an ac adapter can be purchased separately. i love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most.    this is the monitor i use most often in the winter so i do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. it stores 120 readings between 2 users. it is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated only. in addition, it has c.p. g. correct position guidance to ensure the user does not make an error. that only works if it is turned on.   this is great if a talking monitor in both english and spanish is needed. it stores 120 readings between 2 users. in addition to battery operation, it comes with an ac adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. if the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor.    super basic. only stores 15 numbers in memory for one user without any date and time. there is no case and it is battery operated only.   this is good if storage for 4 family members is needed. it comes with a carrying case and it is battery operated only.   the monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. only a standard cuff is supplied  the cuff cable is short. the two power options available are 4 aa batteries or microusb cable not supplied.   the monitor is for 2 users w99 readings each. there is also an alarm feature. a largersized standard cuff is supplied but the cuff cable is short. the two power options available are 4 aa batteries or micro usb neither is supplied. 3.5 stars  this is a decent monitor with a large cuff so larger individuals can use it. it is only battery operated via 4 aaa batteries and only has one user mode with 99 memory points. the biggest negative is the european date and time. 3.5 stars this is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources 4 aaa batteries or ac cable, and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each. 4.5 stars  the monitor is for 2 users w90 readings each. it has a large cuff and two power sources 4 aaa batteries or ac cable. the drawbacks are that i could not get the monitor to pair with the app with bluetooth on and the angle of the display makes it difficult to read unless it is tilted back. also, the time is only displayed as a 24hour clock.   the monitor is for 2 users w250 readings each. it has a large cuff with a cord that is just a tad shorter than other monitors i tried. there is one power source included 4 aaa batteries. there is also a connection for ac cord but that must be purchased separately. the lcd display is large and easy to read.   this monitor has two user modes w99

has two user modes with 60 readings per user. the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. this can be powered by the two included aaa batteries. the led is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. unfortunately, the bp is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number systolic pressure and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number diastolic pressure mostly due to the unitcuff design that does not allow for a secure fit.  the respiration number is accurate, however.    this monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user. the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. this can be powered by four aaa batteries included or included usb cable no ac adapter. the display is large for easy reading. time is in military time only 24hour clock. the cuff inflation is so strong that this is the most uncomfortable monitor i ever tried. it caused my arm to go numb and left a mark and pain for hours.   this monitor has two user modes with 99 readings per user. the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. this can be powered by two aaa batteries, not included. the led is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. there is also a voice assist option. unfortunately, the bp is around 10 points lower than it should be for the top number systolic pressure and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number diastolic pressure. the closer the user holds the arm to heart level, the less the inaccuracy but it is still not as good as the gold standard.  the respiration number is accurate, however.   this monitor has two user modes with 120 readings per user. this monitor is very basic as it does not have an average or irregular heartbeat feature. the cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. this can be powered by four aaa batteries included or

"this is a ""vegan friendly"" toothpaste with a mildly minty flavor that is reminiscent of peppermint. the mildness means it does not have the sting that some other brands have. this may also help prevent sensitivity issues that occur with other whitening toothpastes.as for the actual whitening qualities, after using it for a week 2x daily i have noticed slight whitening effects, but nothing dramatic.it does leave your mouth feeling fresh after brushing however, and my teeth feel ""smooth"" after brushing.the active ingredient is sodium fluoride at 0.24, which is exactly the amount in other toothpastes i compared it to.on another note, there is a considerable amount of air in the tube so it takes a little pressure to release that first squirt.overall, i would say this is a decent toothpaste that is mild, and whitens slightly, but it is also pricey, and not much different than any drugstore brand of whitening toothpaste.",human

"i have a leather club chair that i just love. i also have five dogs, one of whom is a big, active pittie who loves that chair. she sits in it all day to look outside. she also takes running leaps into the chair which causes it to careen across the room into the wall. just about every time. the leather was getting scratched and borderline cracked, like if i had not done something to those cracks forming, the leather would have just split open in a bunch of places.first i wiped the chair down with a clean wet rag, then i took a little bit of this in my hands and warmed it up, then i applied it with my hands all over the leather. i rubbed it in thoroughly, and after 1520 minutes, i bugged it with a clean dry cloth. omg, it looks amazing. you can still see the almost crack, but now that it is not all dried out anymore it just looks worn in and distressed, but no longer trashed.i definitely recommend this stuff. it was so quick and easy to apply with just my hands, and it only takes a teeny tiny amount, so this will last forever. i am about to go condition my timberland boots with it right now and cannot wait to see the results that same dog has trashed my boots  i will not even tell you what she did to those because ick. side note, that same dog licked the chair after i was done, and she is still with us, so its a very dog friendlysafe product.",human

in the picture this foot soaking bucket seems fine and in many ways it is. however in practical use the main flaws inherent in its cheap construction become readily apparent. the soaking pail is made of cheap thin pliable plastic. the problem is that under the best circumstances the plastic soaking pail deforms  elongates once filled with water for your foot soak.what is even worse. if you are hankering for a warm foot soak then you are in a bit of hot water as hot water makes this cheap plastic deform even more. the sort of square configuration of the soaking pail wants to become an oval. the handles stay secure to the pail but feel suspect.  beyond that the soaking pail is fine. it has enough space for my big size 12 feet. i am only 5 feet 7 inches tall. i think god initially wanted to make me taller but he ran out of funding so i was topped out much sooner.all in all i would say this foot soaking solution is adequate but nothing to write home about. i do not hate it but i am always afraid the handles might fail under the load of carrying warm soaking water. i only took off only one star because my foot soak bucket has never failed so that is something.,human

"i ordered and quickly received the pure science dgl licorice 500mg  contains 10 glycyrrhiza glabra root  supports digestive  respiratory function  50 vegetarian capsules. the bottle arrived with a quality control seal, and inner protective seal. for best results take one 1 capsules daily preferably with meals or as directed by your healthcare professional. do not exceed the recommended dose. the bottle consist of fifty 50 capsules or fifty 50 servings per container.  my daughter deals with the annoyance of hyperacidity and burning stomach, and it is not an occasional occurrence but a chronic thing.  usually she dealt with burning stomach or heartburn is to take antacids like tums, tagamet or prilosec. all of these medications work by reducing the stomach acidity.  tums contain alkaline ingredients like calcium carbonate that directly neutralizes the hcl acid in the stomach for a short period of time because obviously then the stomach produces more. tagamet and zantac work by blocking the h2 histamine receptors, which regulate the acid production on the stomach. they provide a long lasting reduction in stomach acidity, because they lower the production of acid instead of acting on the acid itself. prilosec and similar drugs belong to the class of the proton pump inhibitors, which again works by reducing the production of acid by the stomach, in a long lasting, and more aggressive way.  one problem that people including often doctors do not understand is that when people experience heartburn or burning stomach, it is often not caused by an actual excess of acidity in the stomach, but by a damage of the layer of mucus that protects the stomach lining. the stomach is designed to have a very high acidity, both to digest foods and to protect against pathogens that can be ingested with the food, because most are killed by the highly acidic environment of the stomach. acids damage tissues so normally there is a layer of acidresistant mucus that creates a buffer between the acid inside the stomach and the stomach itself. as long as this barrier is in place everything is good.  the mucus production, however, can be reduced by several different factors, like use of aspirin and similar nsaids, stress, steroid drugs, etc. if the protective mucus is reduced, the stomach lining will become vulnerable to the corrosive action of the stomach acids, which will create burning, pain, etc.  it seems clear that the best approach is to increase the production of protective mucus, rather than reducing the stomach acidity, yet all the official therapies focus on reducing the stomach acidity. this, by the way, is a terrible idea unless it is a legitimate case of hyperclorridia or excessive stomach acid because not only does it make you more vulnerable to food borne pathogens, but it can contribute to an overgrowth of h. pylori, if that is already an issue for you. helicobacter pylori is a bacteria commonly found in the stomach that can overcolonize lead to stomach ulcers. h pylori prevents a less acidic environment, and it can actually reduce the ph of the stomach acid. so, if you are taking anything to reduce stomach acid, you are actually doing h pylori a favor, for which it will repay you with some excruciating ulcers.  additionally, reducing stomach acid also impairs your digestion and assimilation of vitamins and nutrients. vitamin b12, for instance, requires a certain acidity for it to be absorbed. same thing for iron and many others.  the only thing that is known to increase the production of the protective stomach mucus is licorice, which dgl is made from. by the way, i am talking about real licorice, not the fake 34;licorice34; flavored candies that are actually flavored with anise and bear no resemblance to real licorice..  so far she have not had any side effects. her stomach has not bothered me. the licorice seems to be of good quality and there does not appear to be anything wrong with it. i would recommend it to others.  i received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. i am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. my aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that i would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer.  i enjoy doing this and feel i am helping hundreds of people to make a decision on purchasing items on a monthly basis!  my remarks are sincere and my own. i work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item. my hope is that these reviews are helpful to others. while it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary, my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product. again, it is just my opinion, your own opinion might vary. i received no monetary compensation and not required to give a good review.",human

"the first thing that i like with this brush is the color! it looks sleek in design. however, it is lighweight like an regular toothbrush and has smaller bristle heads you would think they are for kids. so it would really depend on your preference if you want those heavier regular or this. this would be good for kids though. also, it comes with two boxes anda lot of extra heads. the originalcost seems to be pricey, also the sale price. but since you get two boxes with extra brush heads, it is a good value.",human
"the first thing i appreciate about this brush is its sleek design and color. however, it is lightweight, like a regular toothbrush, and the bristle head is smaller, which may be more suited for children. if you prefer a heavier, more standard brush, this may not be for you. but it is a great deal because it comes with two boxes and extra brush heads. the original price seems high, but with the extras, its a good value.",ai

"this is not a bad trimmer for the price. but i would not describe this as ""professional"" by any stretch of the imagination. it is a beardsideburnhair trimmer made for the hipster crowd.the trimmer body is a cylinder that is not very ergonomic in its design  which a professional would definitely notice. the design is interesting and somewhat artistic in the darkish metal.the entire design of the trimmer is similar to the mercurial style known as ""steampunk"" in people who are familiar with that artistic genre. the metal parts made of dull metal mixed with shiny metal along with the etched artwork of a bearded man circa 1850 give it that touch. it would be a nice gift for that kind of hipster person on your list.it operates okay and has a few different interchangeable blades to adjust the trim length. it recharges via usb cable and has a blue led display that goes to '99' when fully charged.there are a few things that make this less than a professional trimmer. first, the pin mechanism that moves the lower blade when the motor spins is exposed. this is to give it the intended style, but it also presents a hazard where hair can get caught in the exposed mechanism with a likely possibility of hair getting wound around it and yanked out. this is covered in every professional set of trimmers that i have seen and having it exposed would immediately put it into the category of ""personal"" rather than professional.the handle is made of a somewhat shiny metal, etched with the artwork, but it is a simple cylinder without any attempt to create a more natural fit for a hand  in other words, not ergonomic for someone who would be holding it for long periods of time.the other thing is that the battery life is decent if you are using it once a day to trim up your victorian era beard and moustache, but a professional might not like having to recharge it frequently depending on how much it is used. to its credit, though, this trimmer does have a display that will show when the battery is getting low, so that is a plus. it might just be attractive to a hipster barberstylist.one small nitpick is that the blade cover is extremely tightfitting and takes more than a simple flick of the finger to remove. i suppose that will get easier as it is used more, but i have to pry it off using a comb because my fingers are not hard enough to get it to pop off.overall, it is a decent value for the price, but definitely a novelty for the hipster crowd and not made for professional use. but because it works well enough and would make for a nice gift, it still gets a fourstar rating.",human
"this trimmer works okay for the price, but calling it ""professional"" is a stretch. it is designed more for casual use, like trimming beards or sideburns, with a unique steampunkinspired look. while it has interchangeable blades and a usb charging port, the exposed mechanism and lack of ergonomic design make it unsuitable for prolonged use. its battery life is decent but might require frequent charging for professional use. still, it is a fun gift for a hipster.",ai

"i was on the fence about ordering this. the reason i keep trying things is because i woke up many months ago with neck pain. after trying everything i could think of, i went to a chiropractor. his adjustments were helping me before insurance denial prevented me from going back. he gave me an exercise to perform where i had to roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back. that helped some but then i ordered the below devices.  4 stars  5 stars  4 stars  4 stars  4 stars  2.5 starstherefore, i decided to add this to my repertoire. even though the above ""devices"" were good, my neck pain never went away and always came back either lightly or in full force every morning after waking up. therefore,  i decided to try this because a heating pad on my neck sometimes helps.this neck brace comes with three extra velcro strips, a usb power cord no ac adapter, and a manual. only one of the velcro strips can be plugged in for heat. the others are just used as extensions or as a magnetic therapy pad which i think is hocus pocus. the neck brace is segment, so that i should be able to  flare out the bottom lower on my neck if i want less support rather than more support.  i tried this and was unable to get this to flare out. i was only able to use this in the strong support mode.i plugged this into my computer's usb port while wearing it. there is a control that allows me to have high, medium, or low heat. the heat is nice but it is only in the area where the heated extension strip is and not around the entire neck. also, i do not find this too comfortable to wear. i think this will work with some but for me this is not going to be useful. in summary, i do feel this might work for some people but it does not work for me. the heated area is too small and the brace too tall to be comfortable since i am unable to bring it lower on my neck. the current price of 25.99 would be reasonable for this had it worked for me.update i had my boyfiend try this and he hates it. he say it only heats in the patch area, which is true. he gives this 1 star.",human
"i was hesitant at first, but after dealing with neck pain for months, i decided to try this. while other devices helped a little, this neck brace did not work for me. the heat zone is too small, and the brace is a bit uncomfortable. it might work for others, but not for me. my boyfriend also did not like it, as it only heated a small patch of the neck.",ai

"i am a 60 year old woman who has been fighting against extreme oily skin, acne and large pores since my teens. this product has absolutely changed my life.  i have been using it for six weeks. my skin is clear and radiant in a way it has never been before. i am able to go without makeup now with no embarrassment about red, oily, blemished skin. i honestly did not think that would ever be possible for me.the first week i used it, i diluted it 50 with witch hazel because of the way it made my skin burn and tingle. since then i have been using it full strength morning and evening, every day. sometimes i use it at noon if my nose and chin start feeling oily. during the first week a few pimples emerged, i think my skin was purging submerged problems. however those pimples healed incredibly fast.  the spots on my face from old healed pimples have completely disappeared. i no longer have huge greasy pores to contend with. my skin is soft and smooth and radiant. if i feel a pimple start to show up, it heals before it actually gives me a problem!this does sometimes make my skin burntingle rather unpleasantly, but it is only for a couple of minutes before that subsides. it is well worth the momentary discomfort!  worth mentioning is that even when it feels irritated, i have never experienced any redness from using it which i do with many other products. it does not make my skin dry and there has been no peeling for me.  it does burn unpleasantly if you get it on your lips, so i like to apply lip balm before using it.this is a superb product and an answer to prayers for me. i will be trying their other products to see if they are of the same quality. i consider it a bargain at any price and at this price it is a steal!",human

"there are 6 individually wrapped large bath bombs in this set in the shape of pastry shop delectables. each bath bomb is fragrant but smells the same to me.i tried the one with the plastic rainbow on top. i had to be careful that the rainbow did not wash down the drain. the fragrance came through in the foot bath. the bomb dissolved in about 10 minutes. the performance was good with suds that lasted about 10 to 12 minutes. the end result of the bath was almost clear water that was a bright pink. there was no staining to my skin, my towel, or to my foot bath; at least the color of the one i tried did not stain.the current cost of 13.76 15.29 minus 10 for 6 bombs comes to a competitively priced 2.29 per pastry bomb. these are nice bombs and definitely giftable. performance is good enough and they are very fragrant.",human
