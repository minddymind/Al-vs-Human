this essential oil is versatile and effective with a pleasant smellgreat for wound care repelling insects and more,ai
im allergic to nsaids so i used this product for its antiflamitory and wound care after my dog bit me and it worked great  it also smells good which in my book is a plus  there are so many essential oils out there that smell bad and that actually give me migraines because they smell so bad  but this one doesnt do that so its nice to come across ones that actually smell good  i looked it up and discovered that rosewood does other great things like helps with depression and boosts the immune system  it can help the skin if you have sensitive or dry or oily skin  it can also help as a nasal decongestant  it works as a insect repellent which is great cause i dont like bugs and it can be used as a perfume  so its another essiential oil that has multiple purposes  i highly recommend this product,human
less messy than traditional powder but feels greasy and ineffective for its intended purpose,ai
purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder  it is less messy than regular powder however it doesnt work as well  and it is oddly greasy  he reports that it is lotiony in a weird way  since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry  if its lotiony or greasy not so muchif youre hoping for a replacement for powder  this isnt it  at least in my husbands opinion,human

as soon as i attempted to insert a lock cylinder into the top hole and tighten down with the thumbscrews the unusual alignment of the thumbscrewswerent pointed directly at the side of the cylinder kept causing the lock to twist and the thumbscrews kept slipping off the bottom of the lock the plastic ring that reduces the hole size then cracked i didnt even tighten the screws that tight i ended up using a piece of leather as a shim to hold the lock cylinder in place this is a kwickset lock cylinder and is the most common size too much work to set a cylinder,human

as far as removing old steps  this thing sucks  unless you are only going to use this on new steps get something else  the opening in the socket is too small any older steps with rust and bends on them will constantly get jammed inside this bit unless you want a future filled with hammering steps out of this socket move on  i suggest trying the pole step driver from reliable instead and i am a huge huge  milwaukee fan  this driver bit needs a redesign  sorry milwaukee but its the truthas far as this new lime green model goes we stumbled onto one of our newer guys called gogo mounting it into a hammer drill instead of the impact  he swears the in and out motion works a lot better than just spinning in the seated position,human

perfect for scalp healthrelieved itchiness and helped distribute natural oils evenly,ai
this thing is amazing it feels better on your scalp than you can put into words i have a really dry but simultaneously insanely oily scalp the result is that my scalp is always crazy itchy while my hair gets super oily really quickly its a nightmare since using this and other brushes like these the itchiness has calmed down significantly and im able to spread my natural oils through my hair more evenly to prolong the time between washes this is also amazing for deep conditionershair masks because it just really works the product in and moisturizes the scalpi have tried several brushes like these but this one is by far my favorite because it is silicone all the way through vs plastic handle which just makes it easier and more comfortable to maneuver also because the tips provide a deeper more comfortable massage than the brushes with solid tipsi love that you can use it on wet or dry hair this is honestly such a great product that i wish i had been using for years past,human

the three stars are not for the pool itself which is pretty awesome but since the company that sells it plumstruck deserves zero stars i compromised and used three other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue but since the description specifically mentions a ladder i thought the problem was fixed when amazon and i both contacted plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool plumstruck repeatedly ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included since the pool is useless even dangerous without the ladder this issue must be addressed by the ad that being said amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price so if the company would just change their wording people could figure all of this out in advance amazon is investigating the company so hopefully all of this will change some people mentioned a heater but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description i was actually worried it would only work with the heater and i didnt want to have to use a  outlet so i was relieved that it doesnt have one if i decide i need a heater later i will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation i will never order anything through plumstruck again they are a horrible company if you can find this pool through someone else i recommend it it is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workout i also want to add that amazon sells a saltwater conversion system that my local pool store also sells for a lot more money that the pool representative says will work with this pool so i will soon be able to convert it to saltwater,ai

i never thought id order a broom online but years ago i bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom i had ever used i have never found another since then that even comes close i even replaced the old handle when it broke so i could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones i could find locally so i came online to see if i could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after years of hard use and lo and behold amazon had one i paid significantly more for this one than i did my original one and its worth every penny this one is bigger i originally had the  the reason i like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it id repurchase this several times over happily it has made me a broom snob lol,ai

this stuff is the absolute bees knees i only couldnt give it  stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted so about  of it was already spilled out the product itself worked amazingly my hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job and even with gloves on the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands nails and nails bed area in filth i always seem to get black stains stuck to my skin and the dirt and grime doesnt want to come off without a lot of scrubbing but when i tried this product i just applied a small amount to my hands scrubbed and it cleaned my hands right up without a lot of effort the best hand cleaner ive used in a long time and ive used a ton of them its got a pleasant scent too please dont send out damaged containers again though,ai
this stuff is the absolute bees knees i only couldnt give it  stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted so about  of it was already spilled out so i had to clean it off and was left with what was still inside the product itselfworked amazingly my hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job and even with gloves on the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands this is the first thing i use as soon as i get home from a long day the scrubber it comes with is stiff bristled so it holds up well a little product on the nail scrubber and its easily cleans all the grease and dirt right off the product itself is a 1010 but they need to work on the packaging and getting it sent out in something more secure i know delivery drivers smash up the boxes and so the original manufacturer cant be to blame but if it were my product i would put more filling or bubbles wrap the product to keep this from happening i had a friend that had the exact same issue with this product arriving damaged solid product all in all,human

after reading numerous frustrated reviews about digital bathroom scales i can confidently say this one is an exception it provides consistent readings varying by no more than 0 lbs and often stays exactly the same each time its a reliable scale and worth the investment,ai
after reading many frustrated customer reviews and having two separate personal experiences with what appears to be the current state of affairs with modern digital bathroom scales for the majority of scales you simple cannot get consistent repeat readings this scale is the exception and just greatfor some reason it seems to be really hard to design a digital scale that reads the same when you make multiple weighings one right after another whether the scale is too sensitive to subtle changes in the positioning of the feet or its some other factor entirely ive found its common to get over half a pound difference between repeat weighingsbut not with this scale the reading changes at most 0 lbs and usually is exactly the same hallelujah,human

i was looking for a latex insole as i have some in some naot shoes that i find comfortable and love the comfort of latex bed pillows  i was surprised to find that not many brands offer a latex insole and many advertise themselves as latex free  too bad because i find latex to be a very supportive and buoyant material and i went for a short walk with these insoles in my rykas yesterday and they were very comfortable  the only downside is that there is not a good selection of sizes and i am a size  in shoe  so my toes on my bigger foot could feel the bottom lining of my shoe but the rest of my feet were comfortable on this insole  i will definitely buy another pair however,human

i had given up on curling lashes with oldfashioned curlers but this rechargeable lash curler works wonders its easy to use has four heat settings and a cover to protect it when not in use the best part its rechargeable so no batteries needed i prefer curling my lashes before applying mascara to avoid clumping at this price its a steal,ai
i hate the old fashioned squeezy lash curlers and had given up having curled lashes when i saw that there were curling irons for lashes i was excited but was unwilling to shell out a lot of cash for something that might not work this curler was really inexpensive and had no reviews but it looked exactly like one that cost  times as much so i thought id give it a go im glad i did because it really works and has most of the features that the more expensive ones have  this is a winheres the rundown of what i like its rechargeable so no batteries it charges quickly and one charge lasts a couple of weeks it has  heat settings ive tried them all and even the lowest works well its easy to clean and has a cover to keep it protected when its not in use i do want to mention that the instructions advise you to put a coat of mascara on before you use the curler and then to use another coat when youre finished curling all of the curlers i looked at said this but ive started just curling my lashes before putting any mascara on and it works just as well maybe better because sometimes my mascara would clump when i did it the other way it might just be me but i like it betterthis is a great curler at a great price  definitely worth it,human

ok look  its advertised as a flame less candle so thus  i foolishly expected it to look a little bit like a candlemuch like other reviewers have stated the biggest issue i have with this is the electric plug i cant even create the illusion of a candle with that thing attachedthe look is bad the cord is a bad idea and it in no way resembles a candle so much as a badly lit lamp of some sortat least the smell is good when you stand really close to itdo not buy this if you value your money check out the other  any other version by any other company that does not have a cord attached at least then you can pretend its a candle instead of some lame lamp that doesnt even light the area around itself enough to find the on and off switch,human

this kit is not toptier quality but its a good starting point for learning to tattoo it includes everything you need to get started two guns needles practice skin and more however there are no instructions so youll have to figure things out online one of the guns arrived broken and the other stops working randomly while the quality isnt great this kit can be helpful for practicing on nonskin surfaces but if you want to tattoo real skin youll definitely need to upgrade,ai
this is definitely not a highquality set however it does give you an idea on how to set up and use a gun and use the practice skin this comes with everything you need to learn how to start tattooing including two guns needles bottle for sanitizing soap soap not included practice skin power box rubber bands ink and morethis comes with no instructions on how to work these guns so you have to google how to set this up and how to work it which is not good if you have no idea what youre doing i almost want to take this kit down to my local tattoo shop and ask them how to set this up just in case ive been doing it wrong because honestly i have zero clue i figured out the general idea but that was about itout of the two guns one arrived broken and will not turn on when hooked up the other one stops working randomly and i did double check and make sure that the cables were inserted fully the guns themselves feel pretty cheaply made but look kinda cool i do like the hardy look they have going oni havent used this on actual skin yet as im definitely not an expert and really never touched a tattoo gun until nowbut the ink didnt have great results on the practice skin so i dont think i would even attempt it on real skin even with practiceoverall i think this would be an okay starter kit if youre just wanting to learn how to set up a tattoo gun and maybe tattoo the practice skins or some fruitbut youll definitely want an upgrade if you want to tattoo skin also keep your fingers crossed that the guns arrive in working conditioni received this item at a discount  in exchange for my honest  review this had no effect on my opinion of this product and i would have said the same thing if i had paid full price,human
the product was exactly as described,ai
