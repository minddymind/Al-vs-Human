first the mat did not have a plastic cover over it just mailed in a thin box but no damage  this is made in china if you want to know where  it looks made well and strong the brittles are firm but not going to hurt but the suctions only half hold up probably good for feet not the back,human
the mat arrived without a protective plastic cover only shipped in a thin box but thankfully it wasnt damaged made in china it appears to be wellconstructed and durable the bristles are firm yet gentle enough not to cause discomfort however the suction cups hold only partially making it better suited for use on feet rather than the back,ai

given the opportunity to do it again i would not have gotten the white cast iron enamel kohler sink i always wanted but too late we got it and cleaning it is a pain in the neck you need this special cleaner though there are other brands of it but you cant just use dish soap this dissolves stains and metal pot marks you cannot just wash the sink and you can scrub it this is overpriced for what it is and it is a downright shame you cant clean the sink traditionally with dish soap sponge and water,human

i love this little fish the purpose of the purchase was to have one place to put my glasses as i take them off to work at the computer then hunt them down go elsewhere to find them hidden somewhere ie under papers to the right to the left etc so this serves a great purpose i am not an artist but the paint quality seems good the paint is thick and covers the fish well with no streaks and it is covered well the ads colors are accurate and perfect for me glossy but not overly shiny the colors are as depicted in the ad see attached pics the notch for the eyeglass frames is about  0 mm at the bottom and   mm see pic with ruler thus the fish can accommodate a wide variety of frame thicknesses my frames a very thin and while the fish works well it does take a bit of placement to balance the eyeglasses more of an awareness than extra work the fish also seems more stable with hisher nose to the desktabletop i would guess this as well with thickerheavier frames i removed the bar code sticker between the finarms and there was a hole i dont know if it could go on a stand of some sort ceramic dust also came out of the hole revealing that the fish is mad of ceramic and not wood or plastic all in all very pleased with artisanship and functionality,human
this adorable eyeglass holder serves its purpose well preventing scratches and making it easier to locate my glasses the craftsmanship is impressive and the design is both functional and stylish,ai

prosnice lookingsolidly builtconspainful and unpleasant leg massage it doesnt massage the feet with rollers like some other chairs it only has a painful squeezing action using air bags even on the lowest setting it was extremely painfulfeels low end in terms of features compared to other massage chairs in the 2k3k price rangeno memory feature  you have to recalibrate the massage heads for height and width each time you use it it defaults to the original settings each time it turns off whenever you select a new massage setting for a few moments you get a very uncomfortable massage while you have to wait to slowly move the massage heads to a comfortable position using the keypadshoulder and neck massage doesnt work well couldnt find a comfortable shoulder and neck setting and it felt weakfaux leather but i think most massage chairs are using faux leather now,human
pros the chair has a sleek appearance and feels solidly built cons the leg massage is painful and unpleasant relying on airbag compression rather than rollers even on the lowest setting it was highly uncomfortable it lacks features expected in its price range such as memory settings recalibrating the massage heads for height and width every time is tedious the shoulder and neck massage is weak and difficult to adjust comfortably the faux leather material is standard but doesnt add any premium feel overall it feels underwhelming compared to other options in the 000000 range,ai

well it did keep me from rolling onto my back but i did not use it per the horrible directions  directions are minimal  it has a picture showing strap to chest not waist but doesnt say what the benefit of chest vs waist is  the strap is awful  it is rigid and bulky and feels like sleeping on rocks for the most part  first  i am a woman and strapping this across my breasts was not appealing or comfortable  i tried just below and the strap hurt my ribs so i went with the obvious choice and strapped it to my waist as directions said not to do  worked fine strapped around waist  i was unable to roll to my back  i will be changing out the straps as they are uncomfortable  i want straps that have some flex and are thinner  i dont understand how this would facilitate good breathing strapped tightly around the chest  this was the only product i could find to keep me from rolling over so i am grateful it was available  however it could be more comfortable with better straps  the directions are probably vague to avoid making claims so the fda doesnt shut this down but a bit about what the benefit of chest vs waist would have been nice especially as it is uncomfortable as directed  it is also darn hard to inflate,human
while it kept me from rolling onto my back as intended the directions were minimal and confusing the strap is uncomfortable rigid and bulkyalmost like sleeping on rocks strapping it across my chest wasnt ideal as a woman so i opted to wear it around my waist despite the directions advising against it the waist placement worked fine but ill replace the straps with thinner more flexible ones although this was the only option i could find it could be vastly improved with better design and clearer instructions inflating it was also a hassle,ai
this chin strap was such an upgrade over my old one  strong well made easy to adjust and wear,human

the problem is the packaging is overthetop guys i dont want to pay for fancy packaging just put it in a bag seal it and be done with it pass the savings on to your customers its seriously wasteful to put this tiny amount of powder into a fancy bottle and bag i know im paying too much when i see that i know im not getting a good value when i see that i think its probably a good product i dont notice any effects but yet i trust its doing something its probably foolish but i keep buying it because its one of the only dual water and alcohol extracts i will switch as soon as another alcohol extract comes on the market thats focused on value,human
the product itself is fine but the packaging is excessive and wasteful a simple sealed bag would suffice and save costs for both the company and customers while i trust the product works ill switch to a more affordable option as soon as one is available,ai
i initially got the liquid version of chanca piedra because i was in pain and needed fast relief and the pill estimated delivery was further out than the liquid after i found the liquid version worked and i was getting low i ordered the pill version the pill version worked just as good as the liquid version and was a little easier because it didnt require 3xs daily dosage and didnt require all the water dont get me wrong you def need water with kidney stones but its hard to work and function in life when you are constantly going to the bathroom anyhow this stuff is great im so grateful it is available and enabled me to take care of my stones on my own rather than giving my hard earned dollars to docs who btw never mention this products existence,human
i first tried the liquid version of chanca piedra for fast relief and later switched to the pill form for convenience both worked equally well but the pills are easier to manage since they require less frequent dosing this product has been lifechanging for managing kidney stones naturally without costly doctor visits,ai

while results may vary i found this product unpleasant and irritating to my sensitive teeth the pen is harder to use than strips or trays because its difficult to get into tight spaces sensitivity became an issue almost immediately making it a nogo for me,ai
i do believe this product works i bought it years ago and i cant remember what i paid for it or what site i went through but i didnt have any issues with being overcharged nor did i continue to be charged one thing i have to point out though is that i used crest whitestrips shortly before using celebrity sexy teeth i didnt notice any change in the shade of my teeth with the crest whitestrips so i started using celebrity sexy teeth as soon as i finished up the crest whitestrips i noticed really fast results using the celebrity sexy teeth the name itself sounds like a scam and thinking back im surprised i ever gave it a chance but im glad i did many people say it doesnt work for them but maybe using two products one right after another had something to do with it for me not to bash crest whitestrips but i didnt notice a single improvement after using them until i used this stuff right afterward huge improvement,human
i do think this product works years ago i used it right after finishing a round of crest whitestrips which didnt show much effect on their own with celebrity sexy teeth i saw quick and dramatic results the name might seem questionable but it truly delivered perhaps the combination of the two products made the difference,ai
great delivery exactly as advertised,human
delivery was prompt and the product matched the description perfectly,ai

so giving this a try and since its supposed to be mostly natural ingredients im hoping it will not affect any other medications that i might be taking  but if youve never experienced a hot flash or middle of the night sweats its hell  mine were and are still so bad that i have to get up in the middle of the night just to change my clothes  initially when i read the packaging i was a bit confused as in one sentence it says cools hot flashes  promotes perimenopausal and menopausal health im not sure if the word promotes is the right word to describe someone going through menopause would want to hear  i would think words like prevent or  help slow the process are words that sound more comforting and reliable  every woman with hormones will inevitably have to go through this process and they want something that will work well quick and help to ease the symptoms  hopefully i can see more of a difference after i finish the entire bottle,human

i purchased these thinking theyd be like similar showershampoo brushes ive used in the past  theyre not  these have more teeth so when brushing your hair the teeth dont slip through your hair quite as easily  and they are not soft plasticalso when using in the shower i often clip the curved t handle to the shower head spout  unfortunately these wont stay put  they slip off after a few seconds  the curved t handle was the reason i purchased this model in the first place  most of the other models listed on amazon have either loop or grip handles that cant be clipped to the shower downspoutlastly ive noticed on one of these that the teeth shrank and deformed apparently after prolonged exposure to my preferred hair care product  this was a first for me since ive used similar brushes for years without this happening with others you just had to live with the teeth falling out over time  apparently the manufacturer felt that testing or at least researching the effects of different solvents commonly used in hair care products on the plastic used in these brushs manufacture was an unnecessary expense  and thats entirely okay  ill just post a lessthanenthusiastic review and never buy these againyoud think that something like a showershampoo brush would be easy to get right  apparently not  not recommended,human
i bought these thinking they would be similar to other shower shampoo brushes ive used before but theyre not these have thicker teeth making it harder to brush through hair and the plastic isnt soft when using in the shower i tried clipping the thandle to the showerhead but it constantly slips off after a few seconds i also noticed that one of the brushes deformed after prolonged exposure to my hair products which was disappointing i wont be buying these again,ai

this vitamin c serum comes in a thick milky gel formula thats odorless  it glides over my skin effortlessly and absorbs instantly  its comprised of a premium formula thats so powerful potent clean and effective that you normally only find it in highend spas  this serum reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles  the penetrating formula not only cleans and moisturizes your skin it tightens ans smooths areas around your eyes chin neck and cheeks  it works as a deep cleanser to clean out the oil makeup and impurities from your pores so your skin reaches a healthier more radiant look  the hydrating formula allows your pores to breathe by allowing refreshing oxygen to penetrate your skin  its a refreshing change from heavier creams and serumsif you read my reviews regularly you know ive reviewed many serums especially vitamin c serums  for this reason i have chosen to use this review entry to share parts of an article that was published by my awesome beauty thats titled the complete guide to vitamin c serumshow to choose the best vitamin c serum   factors factor   vitamin c formthere really isnt a best form for vitamin c because there hasnt been that much research that shows which one is the most stable and still effectivewhen you are looking for vitamin c you should stick to the derivatives or actives that are tested and proven to work likeascorbic acidascorbic acid has the most supporting research but it is also the most unstable and can be quite irritating at higher concentrations however if your skin can handle it it is the go to active just make sure that the serum isnt oxidizedstill most companies prefer to use the derivatives because they definitely have longer shelf life which is critical for a cosmetics companymagnesium ascorbyl phosphatesodium ascorbyl phosphatemagnesium ascorbyl and sodium pretty much the same are watersoluble derivatives of vitamin c that many believe to be the best form of vitamin c for use in skin care productsthey believe this because it is less irritating and is more stable than vitamin c even better sodium ascorbyl or magnesium phosphate has the same potential as vitamin c in helping with collagen synthesis while keeping the concentrations lowerin the end for those who have sensitive skin or dont want redness sodium ascorbyl phosphate is probably a better choice than ascorbic acidstill sodium ascorbyl phosphate can still degrade when it isnt stored properly or exposed to light and air following the use by dates on the packaging is a must to ensure your get a product that still worksascorbyl palmitatethis form is the most frequently used fatsoluble soluble in oils derivative of vitamin c in skin productsit isnt irritating to the skin and is far more stable than vitamin c still even if it has good antioxidant properties it doesnt boost collagen synthesis as much as other derivatives and vitamin c doesso if you are going to choose an oilbased product that contains vitamin c you want to make sure that it has ascorbyl palmitatehowever it wont be nearly as effective as ascorbic acid magnesium ascorbyl phosphate or sodium ascorbyl phosphatenew derivativesthese derivatives are to be avoided because there hasnt been enough study into their benefitsyou might also find other derivatives such as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate which belong to the new derivatives that are slowly hitting the marketif you remember what we said about derivatives check the paragraphs above most vitamin c derivatives on the market including ascorbyl palmitate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate consist of the ascorbic acid fragment ascorbyl and a fragment of another acid eg palmitate or phosphatethese new derivatives have multiple chemical fragments that are bound to a single ascorbic acid fragment that protect against the core vitamin cso as you can guess it is like having more bodyguards protecting the core vitamin cthey are said to be more stable compared to the other derivatives and vitamin c itself some of these newer derivatives particularly the tetrasubstituted lipophilic ascorbates are also said to be more powerful in boosting collagen synthesis however you will need to put out a little more cash which might not be worth it just yet as we still havent found enough evidence or studies backing up those new derivativesto simplify it if you havenormal or oily skin use lascorbic aciddry or sensitive skin use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and rednesswe will keep a close eye on the new derivatives and will update our article in 2016 so you can benefit from the most up to date informationnote there are of course other derivatives such as a ascorbyl glucosamine ascorbyl glucoside etc but they really lack studies to warrant use so stay away from those forms for the time beingfactor   water based serum or oil based serumif your read carefully our previous paragraph you should be able to answer this questionas you obviously want the most potent vitamin c serum you will choose the most effective vitamin c forms  the oil soluble vitamin c derivative is not as effective as the water soluble ones so you should stick with a water based vitamin c serumyou can also notice that all our top  vitc serums are water based because they definitely gave us better results that is also why most vitaminc serums in the market are water basedthe other advantagethese serums are much lighter and will be much easier to add in your skincare routineas a reminder apply the serum right after washing your face so to let the serum sink in and give you optimum resultsfactor   percentage of vitamin c in the productthe percentage of vitamin c is a tricky factor for formulators as was confirmed by our cosmetologist and formulator friendyou do need a high amount of vitamin c to boost collagen production and help with hyperpigmentation but too much can actually cause irritation and redness  and you dont want to make people have the catch or being wrinkly or redthe goal is to find that just right spot  which can be harder than you thinkthe amount that you should look for depends on whether you have the vitamin c form or the lascorbic acid or the derivativesascorbic acid look for  in the productmagnesium ascorbyl phosphate or sodium ascorbyl phosphate percentages between  remember that these derivatives are as effective in lower concentrations as ascorbic acid word to the wisewhen you are using vitamin c serums and if your skin is pretty sensitive you should consider starting at the lower end and work your way up to a higher concentration so that your skin isnt put into shock you could irritate your skin and make it red and inflamed your skin may dry out and peel which is pretty much the opposite of what you want  dry skin can make you look wrinklier as was the case for several of our readers and  of our testers with sensitive skinstry to avoid pure vitamin c form like lascorbic acid and work with a derivative around  or  for the first month that was more than enough for their skin which showed impressive results example here of vitamin c serum for sensitive skinsso the most important criteria is not the percentage but how much  of vitamin c your skin needs to get results and how much you skin can standthis is a really personalized product and you need to find the right one for you  there is no one size fits all optionfactor   ph levelswhen trying to make a decision on what serum to buy ph levels should be one of the most important things you consider ph levels tell you how acidic the product is  the lower the ph the more acidic the product isnow many people will believe that stronger concentrations of lascorbic means that the product is superior to something with a lesser amount but that isnt necessarily the case the serum should have a ph level of  max preferably lower or it wont be able to penetrate the skin  which is why it needs to be acidic in order to be effective but also why it can be an irritant for some peopleskinceuticals is the one that holds the patent for the lowest ce ferulic serum available on the market it has a ph between  and 0 some of the more affordable brands arent that far above them though with ph levels ranging from 0 to they cant make it the same because it will violate the patent  but it is still low enough to be effectiveas for the derivatives the ph problem doesnt hurt as much because they can go for a more neutral phfor example magnesium ascorbyl phosphate has an ideal ph around  or  which is the ph of our skin this is why some serums that use vitamin c derivatives will come with a sensitive skin labelserums that have ascorbic acid ideal ph of around 0 to 0 which can be irritating for those with sensitive skinserums that have sodium ascorbyl phosphate ideal ph of around 0 to 0 which should not affect sensitive skinmany brands have a problem with ph it would seem in our testing the products werent well formulated and the ph was not within the ideal range for the best penetration of ascorbic acid thats why some people find vitamin c serums ineffective they probably came accross a bad formulated serum to start with obvioulsy we did not keep those useless serums in our top factor   better ingredients for effective team workvitamin c by itself can help your skin but there is a reason that many of the best products have more than one thing in ityou cant use one thing and expect miracles just like you cant eat a diet of only kale and expect to be healthyor happyyou need a little more help which is why it is good to go for a product that has other benefits or beneficial ingredientslook for products that offer tons of antioxidants especially if you are trying to avoid agingin some combinations antioxidants can strengthen each other and go above and beyond what they can do aloneone of those additions could be hyaluronic acid which helps to deliver moisture which can reduce wrinklesyou could also look for aloe vera green tea rosehip andor ferulic acidhaving more wont hurt your skin at worst it just wont help it so look for a product that will be able to deliver on more than one frontupdate you can find serum with  of lascorbic acid the most irritant form but the percentage of vitamin c is not the only criteria to check i definitely prefer less vitamin c like  of vitamin c if it means getting several other potent actives in the same serum that will boost the vitamin c actionremember also as we mentionned it previously the higher percentage of vitamin c  l ascorbic form the more irritant it can be so i know we all want the most effective serum but if you burn your skin it is not really what you want so be moderate and build up from therekeep in mind that usuallythe more vitamin c in the serum the less other actives manufacturers will add to keep the production cost moderatethe less vitamin c the more other actives manufacturers will add  as they have more margin to add other pricey activesof course the choice will depend on whether you use other serums or not in your skincare routine if you only use one serum it is usually a good move to use a serum with a blend of super actives vitamin c acid ferulic etc if you use other serums you can pick the serum with  lascorbic acid as you will bring other actives in the battle against wrinkles with your other serumsfactor   skin typeseveryone has different skin types from oily to natural to dry  and many of us have all three types at oncesome people will have better results with vitamin c derivatives while others will prefer to use the l ascorbic form  it is really a testing game until you find the one that works best for youif you have sensitive skin a product with a high level of ascorbic acid might harm your skin and you should aim to work with a milder optionsome people will be able to use only a little at a time and work up to the stronger levels while others will be able to use the stronger products from the start if you are having problems a useful tip would be to start by applying the product every other day and work up from therego by this rule of thumb when you are just starting outnormal or oily skin use lascorbic aciddry or sensitive skin use sodium or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate to help avoid irritation and rednessfactor   avoid colored productswhen you search for products that have vitamin c or any derivatives try to find a product that is white or colourlessany colouring in the product could hide the signs of oxidation that render the product less effectiveyou want to be able to see a yellowish or brownish tintof course a lack of tint does not guarantee that your product is free from oxidation as the early oxidation stages are colorlesssome unethical manufacturers they do exist will even add colour to their products so that you cant spot the oxidation status  so they can even sell oxidised products without you knowing it  and they can hide the ugly truth however some only do this for marketing reasons  people equate orange or yellow with vitamin c so they tint it that so it looks betterstill we recommend you avoiding vitamin c products that arent colorless or whitethat way you will be able to check the degradation status and as a result the effectiveness of your antiaging  productfactor   packaging  storageproducts that contain vitamin c and its derivatives have sensitivity to air andor light that makes their quality degrade at a faster rate if they are stored incorrectlycompanies do their best in trying to create packaging that helps keep the products fresher for a longer time they use opaque tubes pumps or air restrictive bottlesyou will usually find amber dropper bottle or blue colored dropper bottle which enables to protect the serum from light for your information amber colored glass is said to protect a little more from light than blue colored glass but the difference is not that importantwhat you must remember is to avoid transparent bottles they cost way less for the manufacturer but it means for your vit c serum a shorter shelf lifeyet to get the best results out of your product make sure that you close them tightly to reduce the amount of air that can get in and place them away from lighttry to avoid exposing them to humidity  which means you shouldnt store it in your bathroom many people like to store antiaging products with vitamin c in the refrigerator if that doesnt sound appealing wrapping them in aluminium foil can helponce again make sure that you note the use by date on the packaging  they will be your best indicator of whether or not the product still has a change of being effectivefactor   brand reputationyep would you buy a product from an unethical brand that does not take customer service seriouslywould you even think of spending your money on a company that dont respect you as a customeryou should also definitely check the brand reputation check whether the brand is known for selling scams or fake serumsthere are unfortunately thousands of crappy brands in the internet selling you bottles of water with a simple gelling agent to make a serum that they would market as vit c serumwhen customers start to complain they simply take the money and shut down everything then they can create another brand and rinse and repeati know it sucks but that is the bad aspect of internet as we told you you will find thousands of vit c serums brands on amazon or other big e commerce websites they all claim to be the best serum on earthwe bought many serums to test and were really shocked by some brands selling crap so the big lesson to remember is to be criticalkeep also in mind our reviews dont necessarily mean your will get the exact same results as our reviewers we all have different skin thats why we usually like to give you the criteria and elements to know so you can better choose the most suited serum for your specific casefactor   pricingpricing of vitamin c products can vary greatlysome of the best products from skinceuticals are a luxury item while other brands are far more affordable of course there are a ton of products that fall right in the middleskinceuticals products are great but they might not be worth the money  ml bottles for  unless you have tons to spend and use  bills in the bathroom you can definitely find cheaper serums that are as effective on the other side you also have the serums that cost  and swear to be the end of all your skin problems those brands are created everyday which proposes serums for   with  of vitamin c   of hyaluronic acid  many other actives that are priceyyou look at the ingredients and see all of the buzzwords so you think it has to be a miraclewell just like fake designer bags on canal street these products tend to fall apart at the seams and not offer the results youve been dreaming of some of those products might claim that they are  vitamin c when you open them up and get a ton of water you will realize pretty quickly that it isntto sum it up you can definitely find a good serum that will deliver somewhere in the  range take advantage of sales and seasonal deals as they pop up quite frequentlyi chose to share the  simple criteria involved in how to choose the best vitamin c serum because i found it to be very information  i hop you can too  i like this serum featured in this entry because it contains sodium ascorbyl phosphate  this is one reason why my extremely sensitive skin does not react to it  its also water soluble which makes it more effective and doesnt leave any nasty residue  there are also other beneficial ingredients present such as aloe vera and green tea  really i cannot say enough about this productill sum it up by saying thisthis serum is comparable to other better known brands as far as the ingredients and other factors  yet its available at an affordable price  why pay more for the same thing  i also like the fact they back their product with a  money back guarantee  if youre not satisfied within  days of purchase return it for a noquestions asked  refund  thats a guarantee you cant really sneeze ati received this product at a reduced rate,human

received this footsmart carepeutic foot and calf massager with infrared heated therapy as a christmas gift in 2010 unfortunately there was an issue with the silver placard which had come loose and was stuck on the side instead of being on the top as intended while it was easily fixed the product still works well for foot and calf relaxation,ai
good concept but not a good material,human
while the idea behind this product is great the material used does not hold up well it feels flimsy and doesnt meet expectations for durability,ai
the product came with low power worked once or twice then didnt recharge  that was the whole point of getting it so that was disappointing,human
the product initially worked but its power was weak from the start it only functioned a few times before failing to recharge which was disappointing since recharging was the key feature,ai
these socks are the most comfortable compression socks i have ever worn they have the best colors and i am so completely satisfied i threw all the others out in the trash great price so i ordered  packages and plan to order more in the future,human

the  girls i bought it for raved about this strap on  they had a lot of fun,human
the two people i bought this for absolutely loved it they had a great time using it and have no complaints about its quality or performance,ai
this brush looks good and feel amazing at first inspection  but does nothing to actually cleanse pores,human
initially this brush seemed impressive in both appearance and feel however after use it didnt do much to clean pores as promised its a nicelooking brush but falls short in performance,ai
perfect little box  easy to assemble and box closes nicely,human
this little box is exactly what i needed it was easy to assemble and the lid closes securely simple yet effective design,ai

i put these in a pair of cheap slip on shoes  they are easy to cut to size and fit perfectly  they are super comfortable and converted a pretty horrible pair of shoes into a a super comfortable pair  so far they are holding up very well and have not skid around at all  it does take a couple hours of walking for these to mold to your foot shape but once they are broken in they remain super comfortable  great inserts,human

this product did what it advertised  i purchased it to put medicated lotion on my back and it works  instead of having to deal with pads you apply the lotion directly on the end of the paddle and spread it around  it is lightweight and easy to clean since the application part of the device is vinyl which wipes right off  i would recommend it as a solution for those who live alone or need to be able to self applicate lotion or medication on areas that are impossible to reach on the back  it also has a nice long handle which is a nice plus since you are able to reach all the way down your back with it,human
this tool did exactly what it was advertised to do i bought it for applying medicated lotion to my back and it works well the vinyl end is easy to clean and the long handle makes it convenient for reaching my back great for those who need help applying medication to hardtoreach spots,ai
they work great theyre ear plugs i got tired of using balled up kleenex the only issue is the vibration noise of the cord traveling into the ear canal when it moves around while trying to study  i have used a pair of foam plugs from work that have a plastic cord and its quieteri like these tho i take the cord off to study for school doesnt matter as much if im doing yardwork or in a high noise environment,human
these earplugs work well and i no longer need to use makeshift options like balledup tissues the only drawback is the noise from the cord when it moves around which can be distracting during quiet study sessions i dont mind it for other activities like yard work though,ai
these work for what i need was not happy they was plastic that wasnt in the post and about  were broken   will not order again,human
the product met my needs but i was disappointed to find that many were broken and the plastic material was not as expected the packaging did not include the description details so i will not be ordering again,ai
i like it a lot it works perfect and the suction is excellent it cleaned a lot more than others and it is super easy to use and clean it if you leave more than  secs on the same spot it will bruise but if used properly it is really powerful i use twice a week and it is helping to keep my face out of blackheads,human
this device works effectively and has strong suction power its easy to use and clean and it helped with blackheads after consistent use if you leave it in one spot too long it can bruise but otherwise its powerful and does the job well,ai

i have been on a ketogenic diet for  years one of the problems is knowing what foods might throw you out of ketosis there is so much conflicting information and of course each body is different i have tried keto sticks but they are next to worthless although there is nothing better than a blood test to determine the level of ketones the ketone breath meter is the next best thing you cant always believe the nutrients that are listed on a package there are no regulations as to what constitutes net carbs the only way that you can tell if the food you are eating is throwing you out of ketosis is by testing your ketone level about a half hour after you eat it the ketone breath meter is an easy accurate way to do this in that way you will know for surethis little device is easy to use and seems to be consistent and accurate press a button to turn it on and wait for the  second countdown then blow into it for between  and  seconds there is an audible beep which tells you when to begin blowing and another audible beep which tells you when to stop it then displays your ketone level a reading between  and 0 indicates that you are in ketosis the first time that i used it i registered  to me this seems to be very accurate since i rarely have more than 12g of carbs each dayif you have cheat day or days then you probably will be thrown out of ketosis because of the carbs that you ate  the ketone breath meter will let you know how many days it took to bring you back into ketosis  in this way you can judge whether the cheat days are worth itthe readings on the meter are large and unambiguous it comes with  attachable mouthpieces and everything can be stored in a small convenient pouch if you are serious about a keto diet you need to know your numbers and have the proper information about the foods that you eat and the ketone breath meter is an economic and convenient way to track your ketone level,human
after being on a ketogenic diet for two years i found this ketone breath meter to be the most accurate way to test my ketone levels its easy to use and provides clear results i can now better track whether certain foods throw me out of ketosis its a great tool for anyone serious about keto,ai
works as stated,human
this product does exactly what it claims simple and effective,ai

i just noticed this and some other brands of carbonated beverages at whole foods in the last weeks  i stopped drinking coke and other carbonated drinks because of the high fructose corn syrup and the dense concentration of empty calories as spoken about by   this brands has smaller servings and less calories coke has  calories per  ounce serving meaning almost  calories per ounce ounces coke  calories12 ounces q kola  calories1 q kola has  calories per  ounce serving or almost  calories per ounce ounces q kola  calories8 ounces coke  caloriesan  ounce serving of coke has  more calories than an  ounces serving of q kolaa  ounce serving of coke has  more calories than an  ounces serving of q kola3500 calories in a pound of fat so that is about 1167 ounces more of q kola you would have to drink toto gain a pound of fat you would need to drink  cans of coke or  equivalent cans of q kolathat is you can drink more q kola for the same caloric priceim just saying that q kola tastes pretty good complex spicy sweet and refreshing  like cokewith about  of the caloriesplus you will drink less because the bottle arent  ounces they are  ounces though you canget  ounces cans of coke now and they are cheaper than q kolai will stick with some of these new drinks like q kola put my money into more reasonable andhealthy alternativesthat said i am trying to cut down on all soft drinks and even juice except real fresh juiced fruitsand vegetables  i find these smaller less calorie dense drinks a help in that effort and i also donot like to contribute money to cocacola that has been going on for decades knowing they aare contributing to the sickness and obesity of americans by the way q also makes a very interesting tasting ginger ale  it is sharp and spicy and abit hard for me a lightweight to take straight but on ice watered down which is how i like itits really excellent and sophisticated tasting,human
i recently discovered this brand of carbonated drinks at whole foods and im really impressed after stopping my consumption of sodas like coke due to their high fructose corn syrup and empty calories i wanted a healthier alternative this brand offers smaller servings with fewer calories for example an ounce serving of q kola contains just  calories compared to cokes  calories per  ounces the taste is complex spicy and refreshing offering a similar experience to coke with about  of the calories plus the smaller bottles help keep calorie intake lower i prefer q kola as a healthier more reasonable option over coke and other sugary drinks additionally q makes a sharp spicy ginger ale thats surprisingly sophisticated although a little strong for me to drink straight its a great alternative if youre looking to cut back on soft drinks and want something with fewer calories,ai

these types of pills are hit or miss  they all depend on your body chemistry i have friends that swear by rhino brand and some by new burro thumbs up all the same company and of course tadalafil and sildenafil which none have worked for me unless the purpose was to make my sinuses feel clogged up and give me a headachefortunately after days of browsing i came upon auxilium due to its introductory price i didnt waste any time taking it and it didnt waste my time either but like most supplements the claims are always a bit enhanced themselves sure i may have had an erection that happen at the wrong time for a long period of time however these results are not consistent and what i experienced you may or may not my body reacts well to the goji despite the risk of digestive discomfort you can take one to two of these with at least a 16oz bottle of water they tend to work better with water and less risk of head ache or that stuffy feeling which i didnt get from auxilium i wouldnt say i felt  star results but at least  stars which led me to try out the product that looks almost identical to auxilium called lift  rise to your potential  slightly different ingredients and price same results,human

these glasses are great especially considering the price the upper part of the lens is clear and the designated reading area works well plus theyre stylish which is a bonus,ai
these are by far the lightest pairs of glasses ive ever owned and ive been wearing glasses for  years  the optics are great and due to their size its super easy to just let them slide down your nose a bit so that you can look over them when needed  the fact that they dont have a rim around the top makes em as easy to use as expensive progressive lenses  i got mine for doing computer work  my distance vision is fine so if im working at the computer and have the tv on i can just turn my head look over the top of the glasses and ive got the tv in focus without have to mess with the glasses  also great for reading and watching tv at the same time  they are not blue light blocking which i consider a big plus  i get tired of the tint on the blockers  my only minor complaint involves the cases  theyre very light duty  even the cheapo plastic cases would have been better  again a minor complaint  love em and highly recommend em,human
these are by far the lightest glasses ive owned in over  years of wearing glasses the optics are sharp and the design makes it easy to glance over the top of the lenses when needed the lack of a rim around the top adds to the ease of use similar to expensive progressive lenses the only downside is the flimsy case but thats a minor issue highly recommend them,ai

these glasses fit my yearold son perfectly though he needed some encouragement to use them consistently theyve held up well despite being dropped and sat on theyre great for reducing eye strain from screens and even helped my son with headaches ill be buying a pair for myself too,ai
