i have nasal issues and like my mother boxes of tissue in every room and car  i dont have cup holders in my car but these would work perfectly there  they are not super soft and thick but not thin and rough either so theyre fine  my only recommendation is to look at the diagram on amazon on how to open it up i didnt and ripped off the top i taped it back together tougher and the canister works great one coming out after one is pulled up and out very easily
works great since they do you might ask yourself why do you need five case is great

the bath bombs all look and smell the same they are fairly largeabout the size of medium oranges not gift quality imo as the box doesnt scream luxuryrather it says utility plus it has a wide plastic wrap around it theres a bar code label firmly stuck on the box which says made in china i was unable to remove it without tearing the box so again an argument against giftingthe bombs are individually wrapped and are strong smelling just all the same which is a great pity there is a tiny variation in colour due to to the swirls but thats itbath bombs have become fancy these days and so these dont compare well they fizzed and floated for a while and kids love that but other than that nothing special overall the smell was too strong

one tabet is supposed to last 30 days not true 1 tab lasts 2 weeks i live alone and have marked the calendar to make sure i was correct disappointing
they smell amazing however you would probably need 20 of them to be able to consistently smell them here and there it will be noticeable but its amazing when it is

i have been taking carnitine capsules to help with fibro pain  lets see how these workedhow these comethese come in an orange plastic bottle with an orange childproof cap  the pills inside are pressed white powderare they hard to swallowthese tablets are a bit on the long side but they are not too big to swallow if you are sure to have a lot of water in your mouthany bad reactionsi have not had any burping or bad digestive reactions to thesedo they helpi find that taking these does help with fibro pain and energy about as well as the powder in gel caps that i normally take  they do help take a bit of the edge off of the painthe bottom linethese tablets are not the same as the powder in capsules i usually take but they seem to work as well to help with fibro pain and energy levels  the orange bottle is great to help me find it quicklymy ratingfive stars  i am glad that i got these  i was not sure when i first saw them but after taking them i think they work pretty well

ive been taking lions mane mushroom powder for about 2 months solid and find that it has basically no flavor at all i put it in my coffee or a turmeric tea it mixes in well and its easy to drink ive done a some research on it and it seems to be a very good supplement and highly beneficial for good health here are some the benefits it has enhanced brain functioning ability to prevent or slow the growth of cancer supports heart health helps with depression and anxiety potent antioxidant reduces inflammation boosts immune system supports digestive healththe only side effect ive been able to find is that it might cause a slight skin rash with some minor itching but is very rare and not considered serious just irritating i think this is a very good lions mane supplement
i love this scale very much it syncs right away with my phone and fitbit app the only funny thing is i have to weigh 3 times to get a very accurate reading well worth it to me my daughter uses it also and i love how you can choose the initials of the person so it syncs to the right person i love it the batteries that came with it had a very short shelf life so be prepared to replace them right away the new batteries are going strong i also noticed it doesnt like really cold floors not sure why but that is what it seems like to me
healthy soyfree dairyfree protein awesome i use it in mealreplacement shakes with cocoa powder a little sugar and sometimes peanut butter powder or powdered heavy cream and the price is better than i expected

i did not expect them to be of such nice quality i bought about 40 of them in total to give as gifts to those who take my face fitness class
as you would expect works great for stirring
these are listed as one size fits most my thoughts on that were that that meant fits a lot of different sizes not i wear a 14 and there way no way these were going on i gave them to my oldest daughter who wears an 8 and they barely fit not only were they difficult for her to get on in the first place they kept sliding down over time the waistband doesnt hold them up very good and with the thighs being so extremely tight they kept wanting to work their way down to be fair they seem nice and warm however i wouldnt recommend these for anyone over a size 8 at max or probably under a size 6 maybe a 4  not my idea of one size fits most1 star  awful want my money back2 stars  bad but not horrendous3 stars  decentgood4 stars  really good5 stars  excellent definitely recommend
i really like the quality of these gua sha pink stones from this particular company its polished and smooth and i havent received a nicked or damaged one yet it feels great after youve left it overnight in the fridge overall i like the presentation and quality very much recommended

very comfortable and for the ridiculously low price not falling apart after a month or twoi will easily by more of these when i do break ones i have or wife takes themcome with slim cases and glass retainer cordsalmost 5 star really for the price and quality so far but i reserve 5 star for perfect items
this is a nice basket of bath bombs the basket itself is a decent quality the bath bombs are a little smaller than i expected but they seem to explode slowly so you can relish the experience for a moment or two the bombs are individually wrapped in plastic which has been a little difficult to open the first bomb that i used said it was grapefruit but didnt smell anything like the fruit it had more of a flowery perfume scent the next one that i used was the peppermint one and it did smell like peppermint so i dont know if the grapefruit one was mislabeled or not the bombs havent left any noticeable rings in the tub this would make a great gift
excellent these are lasting well over a year the battery life is phenomenal 7heads is the best configuration for inshower bald facepate shaving7heads are excellent every bit the equal of my 5x more expensive foil shaveras a note i used a shaving creamconditioner provided by the hotel on the road some months ago and not this shaver the hotel cream was too thick and stalled the razor it was a bear to cleanout it was the first time i ever had to pop the individual shaving heads  id suggest you avoid this if you have big hands since then ive stuck to my tried and true shaving cream that enables a close shave and easy flush cream
this is a nice idea and concept but the execution doesnt work for many faces this ended up putting a lot of pressure on the bridge of my nose which isnt particularly huge or anything but this definitely is made for people with tiny noses with a very small or low bridge if thats not you youre not gonna like this very uncomfortable and the little hook bracket things dont connect to anything so they dont stay in place
love this shoe horn  im short with a bad spine  the reach is totally adjustable works great
this was my first time trying chlorella powder and it will likely be my last the smell alone turned my stomach i tried to drink it but the flavor is strong i felt like i was drinking dirty water frogs had been splashing around in im sure the green color added to that mental picture the powder is super powdery so be careful opening the package i used an immersion blender to get it mixed up it seems like a nice product if you like the taste and scent im unable to bear it though
this is a fantastic set of blends for essential oil newbies i have been dabbling in essential oils for aromatherapy application and cleaning purposes for a almost a year now and ive been pleasantly surprised with how much i like them im a big fan of diffusing them to help with quotailmentsquot and i think this set of blends is an amazing deal for a great setwhat i like1 this includes all of the most common oil blends that you can make if you have all of the individual oils stress relief sleepytime headache remedy breathe better health shield immune booster and muscle relief there are lots of mixtures you can do depending on the issue you are addressing but these have been the most common other than muscle relief that we have used in our house2 the sizes of the bottles are great its more than enough to last you a while as you only need a few drops in your diffuser3 they are already premixed in the correct amounts no guesswork no worrying if you have enough of one oil or not enough of another and you can always add a couple more drops of whatever you want to make this more customizable  if you want to add slightly more eucalyptus or peppermint to the diffuser when you use quotbreathequot for instance4 dark amber glass bottles and heavy duty caps to keep the oils safe5 comes in a really nice box so this would be perfect to give as a giftwhat i dont likei honestly havent come across anything yet all of the ones ive tried have been helpful and they smell exactly like the blends i had been doingoverall im glad i gave this set a try and i will definitely be buying my mother a set since shes just starting out with essential oils i think this set is super convenient and well priced for what you get im very happy with iti did receive this item for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing it but my cost has no bearing on how i rate a product
started using march 25 2015 so dont know how it is working yet
i love these aromatic steamer shower bombs they are vividly colored appropriately sized delightfully scented and affordably priced and they always provide an invigorating shower experience each disk comes individually wrapped and the entire set is attractively packaged but i will say that any other scented products i use at the same time as these overpower the fragrant scent of these bombs simply because body washes and shampoos are closer to my nose the air is scented strongly for up to about 3 feet above each bomb and they dissolve cleanly without staining surfaces so id still recommend this boxed dozen to others
my husband is very pleased with this trimmer the price was what helped him decide to give this a try he loves a good deal he recommends this beard trimmer
arrived on time item as described
great trimmer that worked well in shower i still prefer a razor blade for a much closer shave
comfortable fit but not much help with sweating under the mask
i was pleased at first but now i am not  no matter how long i leave my contacts in my eyes burn from this solution  even after i rinsed my lenses with saline solution they still burned my eyes  so i stopped using this and went back to bausch and lomb bio true lens solution
first floss ive found that glides easily between my tightlyspaced teeth  im very happy with this product
works great as advertised
very nice cant wait to finish my current journal to get to use this one
if you have a husband who snores and keeps you awake at night i would suggest you buy these i dont know how i have lived so long without these
i cant take a lot of supplements due to the ingredients which end up doing more harm than good i took these and taking these and have had zero problems as for benefits i cant say that ive noted any unlike pqqresveratrol has many health benefits and i was happy to give it a try we are all different perhaps others noticed a differencethis is made in the usa and gmp certified i always look for that this is a vegan capsule which is great i dont get the addition of lemongrass but perhaps im missing somethingthere are 60 capsules here but the recommended dose is 2 per day so in reality this is a 30 days supply
decent for the price
ive been battling vitamin d deficiency ever since i can remember and this supplement has been helping me a lot this deficiency greatly affects my blood sugar levels so i make it a point to religiously take this supplement i have been getting decent numbers when my doctor orders complete blood panel tests  which goes to show that this supplement is doing its jobi received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes regardless i only recommend products or services i use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself im just a regular consumer and i appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying my views and opinions are from a customerend users standpoint
i was skeptical when i bought this razor due to the pricebut after using it for a couple of weeks i can say that i really like this razor dont let the price fool you the battery life is also very good my last razor would have to be recharged weekly not this one it arrived with 100 battery and ive yet to charge it and i still have plenty of battery left id buy it again in a heartbeat
no complaints at all about these generic replacement heads for a sonicare they fit well on my sonicare  not so tight that they are difficult to get on or off and not so loose that they come off too easily the fit is pretty much the same as the authentic sonicare brushesalthough these are described as being soft i would rate the bristles as medium or perhaps mediumsoft the bristles are definitely harder than the sonicare ultra soft version but are not as hard as the sonicare regular brushes i would have preferred that they be just a tad softer than they are but they are not so hard as to cause any notable gum irritation the oblong head shape is good for getting at the gum line and reaching molarsthe set of 8 come in a single box with each brush individually sealed in a plastic pouch plus theres a cap over the end of each brush i much prefer this type of packaging versus the blister pack method used by other generic replacement heads its easier to deal with and creates less packaging wasteno significant complaints about these  good value for the price
woks great at lowering blood pressure and is reasonable priced
lovely i ordered it because it reminds me of those tibetan temple wheels
nice unit but you can only set both leads to the same strength  so if you have them in different locations they are still the same strength on both lines
very portable and easy for on the go this pump worked extremely well for me easy to clean put together and charger great value for the price i used it while my little one was in the nicu and liked it better than the hospital pump definitely worth the buy
this is a 7 oz bag of usda certified organic maca root it looks and smells like i expected it smells and tastes pretty fresh to me
this did not clean my teeth better than my electric toothbrush i can feel it alas i still gave it a few days and nights to see how my teeth feeli will be sticking with the electric brush as the bristles can actually get in between my teeth this is a dense brush and i can see why they call it the cloud toothbrush on instagramfb it is really soft so for those with very sensitive gums try this its worth checking out to see if it helps youi also felt kind of nasty thinking about how id get this completely clean if i continue using it for the full amount of time as it seems food could easily get trapped in the dense bristles it does have a textured back which i assume to be a tongue cleaner however its useless each brush is in its own container with breathing holes however those are also very flimsy so if you get this knowing youll love it i would grab a toothbrush case separatelybasically felt like i was brushing with a sponge
charge lasts forever fast heatingabsolutely the best i have ever owned even comparing to others twice the cost
this is made of plastic and does not hold suction  bad product
great product and good price
we have used this for all three of our children from birth to when they get out of diapers its so gentle easy to apply and works fast
i have a lot of low backhip pain and after a day of sitting at the computer all day kills me i cant afford a fancy ergonomic office chair so i was ecstatic to see this show up ive been using it for a couple weeks now and im amazed that i feel as good or better at the end of the day as i do when i start working it conforms easily to my back while still providing excellent support its not overly molded so that it only fits one body typeshape the unique design of the rubber stays firm when and where needed but is soft and cushy where needed tooone thing to note is that the cover is a stretchy fabric like spandex which allows it to stretch over the cushion but fit closely to it there are two loops on the back which allow you to run a belt or rope to tie it in place onto your chair however since the fabric is so stretchy and the cushion fairly heavy it pulls down into the seat rather than staying against the chair back so i still have to push it up and into place when i come back to the chair im thinking of sewing a more structured cover that wont stretch so much to keep it in place betteri received a discount in exchange for an honest review
it cleans
this is just the thing to have on hand with the whole covid outbreak this is the kind of supplement that you dont need until you really need it i like that it has elderberry vitamins and b in addition to the standard vitamin c
i love the massive amount of time turmeric in these capsules turmeric is a wonderful all natural antiinflammatory joint pain fighting machine most brands that ive looked at have under 1000 mg per serving but i was looking for a product that packed a bit more of a punch and this product was the winner each serving of 3 veggie capsules contains over 2000 mg of turmeric as well as black pepper for maximum absorption its organic and each bottle contains a months worth of capsules
for the past 10 years this is the easiest way ive found to give calcium to my 30 lb dog to supplement her home made diet i use it with an oral syringe  i load it up every 10 days squirt 1 ml into her dinner every night thats it no fuss no muss  no refrigeration needed best of all her bloodwork is always just about perfect being a product for humans i can worry less about impurities that eggshells or petonly products might havei had a whole lot of trouble finding this for a while my local pharmacy stopped carrying it because they couldnt get it i couldnt find it anywhere online in the meantime i tried a different calcium solution it didnt have nearly the concentration and was very sticky it meant giving my dog even more sorbate thats not nearly as bad for them as xylitol but its always wise to keep artificial sweeteners to an absolute minimum for dogs i ended up throwing it all out the minute i could restock on the roxane version seems that roxane had to recertify it or something anyway its still hard to find and i am very glad to have found it here
its  best to have extra magnetic clips for your cpap straps good buy

i have taken 1 to 2 grams of omega 3 every day for the past two decades  my reasoning for taking the supplement varies with my ailments and the research  it has been shown to be useful for mental health inflammatory disease muscle strength and cancer prevention  i used to take it for my heart and memory but im not sure the science supports that  i take one pill a day to supplement the large quantities of fish oil i get from fresh caught fish that we eat every other dayi chose this brand because of consumer labs recommendations based on formulation concentration quality and price  not only is it one of the most concentrated capsule form but buying it in this two pack with an additional discount cut the price to 14 a pill making it the cheapest omega 3 per 500 mg
we use in our apartment bedroom for great sleep
great value and a lot of sounds to choose from doesnt seem to loop either
i thought this would be a great set and im always looking for good clippers so i ordered this setstraight out of the package the case was very sticky  i used a lens wipe to clean it off and it worked admirably buti shouldnt have tothere is quite a lot in this set but the nail clippers the standard on how i judge a nail care set both left my nails a little rough and frayed after using the nail file was fine but the other tools seemed a little rough i wouldnt necessarily want them going under my nails or pushing back my cuticlesthe ear digging tools description made me laugh are self contained in a little tube with a screw on top that is nice that you can isolate themthe heavy duty toenail clippers was the best of the lot they worked well and didnt leave my toenails jaggedso this is a cheap quality functional nail maintenance set there are better ones out there for a better price i know i have a couple i wouldnt choose this set again and i wouldnt feel comfortable giving as a gift id give it away but not as a gift if that makes sense
this is a great interim product for in between chiropractic adjustments
perfect for my grandsons 1st birthday
works for sore muscles as well as face roller
works good but theres cheaper products that do the same
as advertised
saved me money by salvaging the waterpik that i currently have over buying a new one seems to have similar design flaws as the original like the water doesnt all come out which harbors a moist environment that mildew and mold love the quality isnt as high though the hinge to the door broke on one side and snapped off on the other side the door can still seal the hole but its now a separate piece still usable but not ideal as i almost lost the door down the drain
really helped with tension in my shoulders
i blend with plain yogurt works well
looks like a 2nd hand item that id buy at a thrift shop or a dollar store
my sixteen year old suffers from neck and collarbone pain due to a sports injury this helps him to relieve pain and relax the muscles in his neck he can lay on this a few minutes at a time a few times a day and it helps tremendously its a thick curved pillow that looks uncomfortable but in reality its the opposite it steadys his neck and stretches the muscles great value
shiny black jasper with archangel sigils for michael raphael gabriel and uriel as in pictured and described i wanted these to use for my healing work and they are exactly what i wanted
feels good in your hand and is light weight but squeaks very badly on shower doors and does not make a clean sweep of the glass  is not worth the price they are asking  streeks really bad also if your lucky enough to actually get the water off the glass
the foam is much easier to clean
this is not noisy at all another person stated it was very noisy it makes a little hum soothing really my baby falls fast asleep while its on i have this in our bed room and i enjoy it the air smells cleaner and our house is brand new and very clean but it just seems fresher i am buying another for my other childs room i love it so much we own a rental and i even put them in the home to rid the other peoples smell of dog and so on the bulb last 4000 hours and should be replaced if not out by then to insure its doing its job if i was rich i would buy for every room at once but im not so i buy one at a timeside notethis is awesome next to a diaper pale or trash can
excellent organic essential oil at a very good price

i have used this product for years as a supplement to my diet and my active lifestyle  unfortunately it is not vegan so i had to stop using it  if your are not vegan i suggest you try fruitein before other similar products

not great compression unfortunately i wasnt able to return these so im stuck with them now i wouldnt purchase them if you need tighter 2030mmhg compression as they fit more like sort of snug socks
ive never tried a protein drink thats basically a shot its a novel concept that i enjoy very much the bottle is small enough to fit in a bag to take on the go you can drink it alone or add it to other liquids the flavor is pleasant there are artificial flavors if youre trying to avoid them otherwise this is a good productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
i chose this curling brush because i read ceramic tourmaline is for thinner fine hair like i have it produced nice curls and my hair stayed curly a little longer than usual but i didnt see anything much different than other curling brushesi had quite a difficult time learning how to curl my hair without a clip i guess the no clip is for curls to look more naturali think it is a misprint that it is on sale from 149 as it statesit did the job of curling my hair but it didnt go above and beyond regular curlers
great size to carry with me
the only thing that works for sore swollen feet  ive used it for years and now i cannot live without it while pregnant  nothing else even comes close
this the wright size for everyone
just okay  serve their purpose
i cant explain how many different places  companies ive tried this is good if you shift around and like to shake your booty some people say it collapses yeah it does but i dont know its a good option if you move in your seat and want a little refreshment
i dont know what planet you guys are on but this is the worst car cleaner ever it leaves a white residue thats almost impossible to get off even if you rub it immediately after you put it on im returning it whatever you do do not buy this product

great balloon that literally stayed filled for weeks large and beautiful perfect for any birthday or occasion
i really like this got this for my 7 year old son he loves the taste great quality contains organic vitamins and minerals definitely yes
used this soap the day that i received it  havent a negative thing to say about this product  it is just exactly described justas it is  very hard in the container and looks as though its been poured in  while it was hot  very rustic looking in the plasticcontainer  as it is supposed to lookyou can tell that some serious work went into the making of this soap  by its performance  after running hot water into thebowl and using a fine shaving soap brush  you will get a very rich creamy good smelling lather  you will get a close shavewith minimal nicks and irritationanother fine point is  you will enjoy a unique old time barbershop scent while shaving  an important point is  this soap isin line with other brands of shaving soaps according to price  you cannot order a good quality can of shaving soap for lessthat 15 dollars  this shaving soap is somewhat a cut above your average shaving soap on the market today  therefore  ican comfortably say that this shaving soap is a fair price for the quality that it  factually isit appears that you will able to get months of shaving from this reasonably large can of shaving soap  the container is not a cheapplastic  it is a heavy duty plastic jar with a screw on lid that fits precision and will screw on tightly to keep your soap freshthis container will not allow your soap to dry out  all in all  i cannot find fault with this product or the seller
up until recently its been hard to find good vegan sources of d3 this is a powerful source of veggie d3 that packs double the punch of my usual supplies of vitamin d3 usually i find 5000 iu to be the standard ive read varying opinions about 5k and have heard that the body doesnt absorb larger amounts as well as 2k or smaller the national academy of medicine lists the upper daily limit at 4000 iu though doses up to 10000 iu have been found not to cause toxicity in healthy humans for this reason i wont be taking daily megadoses of vitamin d i will take these capsules once or twice a week in supplement to my daily multivitamin which contains 100 of my daily supply of vitamin d i like taking more especially during the winter as my health insurance does not approve vitamin d tests in healthy individuals my ageall that said this is a good quality mushroombased source of vitamin d3 formulated by a former cleveland clinic doctor recommended and longlasting if one takes once or twice a week as a supplement to daily multivitamins im set for a year or two
the glue tabs are not going to hold this  i used pins eventually after having it fall down several times  it does require some slight assembly as the letters are not all connected like it appears in the picture and do not come on the ribbon  not really a big deal though
works well
excellent product and your service too

i have tried so many sleep masks over the years and this is in my top ten  its comfortable and easy to wear  the strap is adjustable and it isnt bulky under my head when im sleeping on my back  it washed well in a lingerie bag and hung up to air dry  the material and foam are both soft against the skin  i have long lashes and masks usually rub against them and drive me nuts but this stands far enough away from my eyes that it doesnt bother me  these work really well for blocking out all light  a
does the job but the caps on the large bottles dont always go on correctlythey dont seem to line up right and have sipped off when i didnt triplecheck to make sure it had latched  this doesnt to be a problem with the smaller ones so i guess it was something offspecification in the manufacturing of the larger ones
spendbut worth the bucks really does a fabulous job if you follow the directions
i use this product per dr recommendation to treat corneal edema so when i dont use this type of product my eyes get very blurry i will agree with other reviewers this product is thicker and gloopier than competitors however in all the brands i have tried i have never found one that keeps my eues clearer i am really happy to have found this no it may not be the easiestmost comfortable to apply but for me it works
this probiotic was recommended by my ocupancturist to promote my immune system two years ago i have been taking one a day and it has been working very well for me when i get a cold it wont last a long time
love the smell not sweet and cloying like some others also keeps bugs away had an ant problem at one apartment used this around any sweet drink no more ants in my tea or soda no more ants on my tables around the windows and doors they stopped coming in all the bugs stayed away
i like the size there is a large handle and a large compartment for collecting the lint
in this day and age of excessive hand washing  i had to have some of these to save my poor cracked over washed hands  still have to do the dishes  they are extra long  i consider myself to have a medium size hand and they are snug  but not too  comes with a set of 3 in 3 different colors  that happen to work for spring right now  but who really cares  my hands are grateful
loved the price and product
my feet are horrendous its genetic and also i wear a lot of flops or go barefoot all the time so callouses are just a normal thing for me i get a pedicure once a month and even that never did much what i actually do it use the blade shaver and shave most of the big callouses off and then use this to smooth it all down my feet arent baby soft but theyre no longer rough i love that they send you so many extra sand paper discs i do my feet like once a week and im no where near halfway done and ive had this thing for months now i do have to us one disc for each foot because of the amount of callousing all over my feet but the end result is great i then lotion my feet up and the next day they are nice and smooth totally worth the money
this suction cup really sticks  it is very strong and holds the shower so i can sit and wash my hair
i love these little lanyards to keep up with my masks they are always handy and it helpskeeping them clean
when i got it the seal was open im pretty sure its fine other than that i love it
i drink a lot of coffee so decided on buying this i did not notice any difference on my teeth will say since i have sensitive teeth worked out great on that point but did not see whitening effect using this
great product  i was always so cold and the space heater made the air dry but it was never warm enough to work without a coat and gloves on  with the heater on my chair is comfortable my body is warm and the air is no longer super dry  with the legs and back being heated my arms are no longer frozen and i finally have feeling in my fingersas a bonus the heated pad is great for any soreness in legs and lower back which has made my sleep significantly better  highly recommend this item
during the great glove shortage of 2020 i decided to invest in some long reusable gloves while they arent as form fitting as regular nitrile gloves im able to wipe down groceries and open packages just finemaybe someday soon i will use them for their original intent and wash the dishes with them
this essential oil is a blend of sweet orange neroli and thyme the combination evolves into a delicious orange aroma i use about four to five drops in each of my diffusers and the fragrance wafts through the entire room it is lovelythe current price of 999 is expensive for 17 fluid ounces however since i like the aroma so much i did not take off one star for the high price
very nice glad i found it on the internet but personally i feel 1600 too much in price  for this tiny small bottle i do like frankincense and myrrh  recommendglad when it goes on so so sale it is a good oil  thanks
perfect for just about anything been using these about 6 months now and they are durable used for colloidal silver in the eyes ears and nose when necessary and never let us down
fast delivery and work steadily
i gave this a five star for easy to inflate because i had a special pump from a previous purchase that made this easy  without a pump it would not be easy  this was a great affordable 2020 decorations
there are some good things and less good about this but the review comes with the caveat that sleep preferences are so individual that its tough to say how much ones view should hold for someone else but that said1 size  the footprint is nice it doesnt take up a lot of space id call it medium size maybe leaning toward small ive definitely seen many that were bigger so you dont need a lot of space to use this2 lighting  id prefer a dimmer light personally thought the breath function and colors are nice if you have this right near the bed its a bit too bright id say but if its obstructed or youre  not facing it than it isnt bad at all3 volume  volume control is goodim not sure why youd want it loud i guess if you have a lot of street noise but it can get a decent volume on it4 sounds  this was the more problematic issue for us we just didnt find many of the sounds pleasurable or soothing some would have soothing parts but then a loud surge of sound would appear which would seem to defeat the purpose weve heard others that were just more tranquil soothing some of that can be somewhat ameliorated by the volume control obviously but still wasnt what we were expecting there are a good number and variety but honestly wed only use 3 possibly 4 on the other hand if youre looking for drownout sound you might find that less of an issue5 timer is good and works well never understood ones that came without them so this is a good id say required touchits a useful solid product but not quite as allaround useful as its numbers of lightssounds might indicate at least for us  no concerns over qualityfeels well constructed and responsive
i listened to the audiobook magnesium miracle and read so many good reviews i took this for anxiety which i get very easily 2 to 3 hours after i consumed this i had very bad anxiety for no reason  it is no fun feeling like you cant get a good breath of air and your heart is beating so fast  i will not take another drop  as everything i purchase on amazon i always get to return if not satisfied  but checking this better i cannot return it therefore 2999 plus tax of 272 and shipping cost of 694 3965 down the drain
fits perfectly
biz beats every other laundry additive ive every used  my mom used it decades ago when i was growing up and it still works better than anything else on the market  i cant figure out why its so hard to find in stores  i guess because they dont spend a lot on mass advertising so there is little demand  most sellers on amazon were pretty expensive imo but by buying a pack of 4 boxes i got the best price  itll probably last until my grandkids grow up but at least i have a good stash now  for really tough stains make a paste and spread the paste on stain  let it sit and work for up to hours before washing  ive never had an issue with this technique damaging colors
good quality
love these to clean my mat with and to spray for odor mine didnt come with 6 towels but i contacted a rep and she replied and personally mailed me the 6 replacement towels
bought two of these for my husband hes a big man and no one size fits all works this one did hes not quite as cranky wearing this mask and he likes how it has the neck strap so he can rip it off the minute its allowed and it hangs from his neck i just ordered one for myself just because its bigger and hopefully i can breath easier in it we are not happy mask ppl we both wear glasses that fog up when wearing them they still fog up with this one but adjusted just right and its not as bad
did  not help me with shoe slipping
the paper towels are very soft and the design is simply beautiful the value of the paper towels are great and i think these towels can be good decoration for my room
great way to supplement your daily smoothiefruitveggie shake with vitamins given that this is certified organic vegan  nongmo it is a great all natural way to give your body an extra boost of vitamin c i am deleting a star simply because when i first tried to mix this in just juice i saw that the powder does not mix well my juice was cloudy however i started instead to mix it with my smoothies and it worked perfectly no taste blends well when the mixture is thicker
these are just like the ones they put in your car at the carwash and the smell lasts a long time
love the large size does the job
this contraption works  i have a little tummy and some of my jeans fit fine in the hips but pinch at the waist  i stretch them out using this device and wallah they fit like they are custom made
great product easy to take and i believe effective i trust life extensions as a company i consider them to have integrity and they certainly have a good reputation
i have been taking this pill for a few days and they are easy to swallow the instructions say to take with a meal so i have been taking them with my lunch the smell is a bit unpleasant at first but you get used to it after a few days havent noticed any changes yet but i am sure that will come within time you cant go wrong with the price compared to other probiotics
my sheepskin boots dont have a removable insole and had gotten very unfluffy at the bottom these fixed that and i will get at least another year out of the boots thanks
these gloves fit as expected  i use them mostly for household chores but will use them for washing things outside such as vehicles and patio furniture once the snow thaws and springtime arrives  i have no preference for either lined or unlined  i especially like them for washing fragile glass items because even in soapy water the gloves keep the glassware from slipping out of my hands  i also like the length for protecting my hands and forearms while reaching into a bucket
perfect for a small bathroom
having two kids we have tried few similar items i can say that this one is much gentler on kids than fridait is easy to use and works fast and easy to clean
product is amazing thank you
they use intesinal binding fillers  maybe thats why no full label ie ingreds shown my glands swell cannot swallow and i lose fingernails if ingest magnesium stearate it is not benign
i needed a strap for my son who wears glasses and has hearing aids something that would allow him to easily pull his mask up and down without pulling off his hearing aids the strap connects to the mask and fits nicely around the back of the neck which means one less thing behind my sons ears these straps were super easy to attach to the mask they adjust easily and the quantity ensures i have plenty in case some are lost they also wash up well in case i forget to detatch them from the cloth mask during washing i highly recommend these straps for those who struggle with straps behind the ears
tasteless does not whiten as i expected
my mom raved about the old fashioned norelco electric razors but id never tried one quite like it this 5head razor gives me the closest shave ever where has it been all my life usually my electric razors are good in a pinch but they always make look like i have 12 days growth this shaver is different its just as close as a manual razor my legs and underarms are just as smooth as if ive just whipped out the shaving cream and straight razor i also love how the five heads are put together in natural curves to complement the human body its as if this was custom designed to fit over my knee caps  and how many electric shavers can actually get the knees smooth up and down or around in circles this safe razor will never hurt youas an awesome bonus this razor comes with several attachments to change attachments and to clean it read the manual and have some faith that pushing and pulling wont break the device ive tried the trimmer with the three levels of attachments and its not barberquality but its good enough in a pinch the facial massage and scrubber are really nice the dry brush massage is so gentle and the soft plastic scrubber really adds an extra oomph to my cleanser thankfully i havent had to use the nose hair clippers so i cant report on the effectivenessit also comes with a little brush to clean under the heads again read the manual and a small bottle of oil so you can replenish the lubrication my device came prelubricated which was nice its easy to hold quick and easy to charge in a usb port cord included and the electric display shows how much time is left before you need to recharge it is not waterproof though so dont take it into the bath dry off and use it after
i tried using this for a few days and the hardness of the plastic really bothered me the literature that came with the item did say the plastic was hard and it might take you some time to get used to it but i got headaches and only used it a short timei did keep it and may try using it again
does the job
tastes awful hope it works to steady my gait
the bristles only extend about halfway up my teeth  my teeth were not clean after using this its in the trash already
to slick a material  food falls to floor
good product love that its clean but does not dissolve as well as other brands of peptides i have tried their bcaas are awesome though
works very well for our needs
great product fast shipping
i buy the big box of eggs and was reusing the stryophome cartoons and i came across these and have never looked back
we love these great taste and consistency 5 a bag cheaper than vitamin shoppe delivered to my door awesome
they work really well but i hate bubble gum flavor that being said its not overpowering
the compression is literally comforting
i am new to this brand joon x moon and find them very giftable  the packaging is beautiful and their scrubs and bubble bath fizz formulas would cheer me or my friends up at the end of a long weekthe bubbling bath fizz has a lovely scent which permeates the bathroom for a while as well  i tried both the lavender and the champagne scents and loved them the instructions dont say how much to put so i put 2 capfuls and this was enough to give gentle bubbles and a lovely scentthe lavender is strong but not medicinal and the champagne has a slightly fruitier almost lychee undertone  both are lovely and not overly sweet  the bubbles are soft and plentiful and the scents are relaxing and make me feel like i am somewhere else  the minerals in the bath also feel soothing  overall it feels very pampering and helps to wash away a tough weeki love the way that these bottles look in the bathroom as well  another reviewer mentioned theyd prefer to have them in glass containers but it feels safer not to have glass in the bathroom where it might slip or get knocked off
little packets resisted tearing open for me i ended up needing scissors or a knife to easily open these the flavor was okay seemed to help in hydrating the skin something i need a lot of help with ive had better mixins and ive had worse
ive taken milk thistle for several years to protect my liver against the daily damage i do to it with alcohol ibuprofen and whatever else hurts it this product is as good as it gets very high concentration super clean smelling 120 capsules per bottle  excellent value i take nightly my last blood screens came back in normal range doc said all looks great i believe in the power of this
they are vary good to use
so i had been buying the primal life dirty mouth tooth powder and was loving it except the price was gouging me so i went on the hunt for a more affordable tooth powder option i stumbled upon this for half the price and decided to give it a go in terms of tooth cleanliness it probably works about the same ya about the same however it sucks every single last drop of moisture out of your mouth the second it hits it the mint is also not very strong at all it in no way helps freshen my breath and my husband and i have started having to use mouth wash which imo defeats the purpose of going chemical free also because it does suck moisture out ive found that chunks of it get stuck to my teeth or gums and i have to do a clean run through of my toothbrush with just water on it to get this off just swigging with water wont do it weve hand this over a month and still have over half the jar left so honestly its a good amount of product for what you payim still on the fence though if im gonna reorder this or go back to the primal life toothe powder
this item was purchased as a gift for my insomniac motherinlawshe absolutely loved the feature of stars on the ceilingshe said that it reminded her of camping as a young girl out under the starsthe soothing tones and sparkling stars have put this grandma to sleep
colors match picturemix of vibrant black and greymaterial is a little toughseems very tight making it kind of hardlathers okay but not so good because of how tight it isused it about 3 times so far and seems to be loosening up
works great and shipped quickly
my puppies ignore this i was disappointed became they chew everything shoes furniture chairs etc i had wished they would love this instead they do like pigs ears
i purchased this wrap for after the shower while im getting ready for work its thin but still absorbent and the color is a pretty blue the velcro is easy to attachdetach when putting on the wrap the length could be shorter for me to love it but it still serves the purpose and well
i have never liked sponges until now magic eraser does a better job on my washable wallpaper than terry it did not scratch or cloud up my chrome fixtures when i removed hard water deposits and i didnt even have to use vinegar after testing a spot i cleaned my stainless steel sink im looking forward to wiping my showertub without cleaning product fumes i wont use the sponge everywhere for everything but for those 4 chores its a winner
ive had them for a day and i love them i work outside all day and it was a pain to keep switching from my sunglasses to my readers now i dont have to unless im in a poorly lit place i highly recommend them
really expensive for what you get  not really that exciting if you are looking for a laugh and want to spend a lot to get itthen go ahead
this is a supplement in powder format that you mix with water the mixing process isnt totally smooth there are generally little clumps in the water but it doesnt really bother me that much im just trying to get it down quickly anway there is a taste but its not anything terrible and is pretty easy to get down as to the results i cant tell at this point if this has changed my digestion but i do find the research very interesting and will continue to see how things progress as i continue to take this each day
i have a few of these towel wraps and find them very convenient  i usually use them when im getting ready instead of wearing a robe  theyre reasonably absorbent they stay in place and are less bulky than a robe  laundering is easy and inexpensive and they provide decent coverage
these gloves are awesome thick enough that someone as clumsy as me dont have to worry about destroying them
my wife loves this lotion  she does not have diabetes but does have dry scaly feet blue emu does the job for her
i was initially skeptical about this thinking that it might leave white marks on my body or make my towel oily but turns out its super easy to apply after shower because of all the moisture still left on the skin and it turns clear on the skin after applying and doesnt stain my towel either i like how smooth it feels and how fast and easy to apply will toss out my regular lotion and use this one from now on
i was really looking forward to receiving this item because of the way it appeared on the site unfortunately my first night using it was a bid disappointment the mask is soft and plush to the touch however when worn at night the nose bridge part presses way too hard on the top of the nose and impedes breathing if i loosen the strap which is not velcro and gets tangled in the hair the mask then is too loose and falls off the face the pads press just too much on the bottoms of the eyes and make it uncomfortable to breathe and turn the head the strap gets tangled in the hair because you cant velcro it over the back you have to pull it over the head the padding is weighted incorrectly and caused me discomfort while trying to breathe and sleep with it therefore i had to return it  maybe for less sensitive sleepers this might work  but this was advertised as designed for ultra comfort and sensitivity
bought this for my 76 year old mom who does not have a land line her cell does not ring loud enough at home needed it to be louder so she could hear it everywhere in the condo and this device does the trick she is very satisfied
this really is an excellent toe nail clippermuch better than the typical style most people use and easily the best i have tried the longhandled small scissorsontheend type are hard to use and often do not cut cleanly and easilyfor the average person however im not sure i would recommend it for fingernails since it can leave a bit of a rough edge
is it just me or has the company started using less lotion in their product  its just the same as using regular puffs of kleenex
good product better than liquid always rely on it will order again when needed good price
they run small son is thin and wears a size 95 shoe these are tight on him if you are a bigger person they may be uncomfortabletight
after installing this to my waterpik and trying it out for the first time there is a slight leak that drips from the handle down the hose  its only a few drops each use but there shouldnt be any  also i cant explain why the pressure doesnt seem to be as strong as the original
i bought this for my sister who is onto special effects makeup as a birthday gift in the description it says that this item is ammonia free which was exciting because she always complains about her eyes burning because of the ammonia i just opened the package and on the ingredients list is ammonia hydroxide and ammonia im sure she will still love the liquid latex but its disappointing that it has ammonia in it i will not repurchase this
i normally just clean my mat with soap  water but this method tends to make the mat too slippery which is unsafe this cleaner comes with a microfiber cloth and it only takes a quick spray or two to cleanse the entire surface without losing grip i would recommend this product to anyone who regularly uses a mat
this could have a been a nice desserty protein bar coming out of your dessertsnacks calorie budget instead of the main meals unfortunately the various mass market ingredients they put in it give it a not so pleasant after taste an after taste i never get with protein bars that use only 34real food34 ingredientsso while it tastes fine while you eat it and tempts you to forgive the long list of ingredients the after taste is a reminder of what it is  maybe they can make 34real food34 version of thisthe 6pack is stored in a sturdy compact purple cardboard box which you can easily repurpose for other household uses if you open it gentlynutrition wise it has plenty of vitamins and minerals protein 34wins34 1514 over sugars itt is a product of canadasweetening in this is done with among others glucose syrup sugar glycerine high maltose corn syrup evaporated cane sugar fructose dextrose etcthis is so frustrating because its a promising taste combo with 15g of protein but you get all kinds of corporate food crap including carrageenan
sleeptoo much noise around here
accurate description fast shipping
too tight
did nothing for me
just as described holds to basics
i heard about these a few years ago how great they are for your teeth well after finally trying them i must say that they did not disappoint first of all with these each one is individually wrapped and they look very sanitary i didnt feel uncomfortable at all peeling off the outer bark and chewing on the stick it does have a flavor which is sort of indescribable but bits can come off in your mouth and they are much like shredded coconut anyway after softening and chewing the tip in your mouth by gently chewing on it the fibers fan out to form a brush while the stick is long its impossible to get the inside of your teeth but as you use it up its easier to get your hand in thereso i wouldnt use these as a replacement for my toothbrush but they are a wonderful accompaniment my teeth feel great after using it it brushes all the plaque away and leaves you feeling super clean but without any mint each stick lasts quite a while because you only use half an inch each time and then use a scissors to snip off the used part so that it remains sanitaryif youve never tried these all i can say is that my experience was pretty good and i would definitely recommend them i hope this review and the video has helped you to decide if youd like to invest in these
i dont know if the good reviews are paid to say what they are saying but this item certainly did not work for me a waste of 20 i have wavy hair and its not hard to manage but this brush did not straighten it at all
get the same results buying the ones in targeti would not purchase these
my two cats often get runny eyesallergycold side effects this helps tremendously
i purchased the 34got milk34 straws on sale for 1796pk at target and my kids loved them i wasnt going to target for a few weeks so i decided to purchase these since it is a mix of flavors  my kids so far have enjoyed them  they are a bit more expensive but the container is very nice and the lid snaps on so they are not in a ziploc bag or just laying on a pantry shelf  i think it was worth the purchase for the container alone  they look just like the 34got milk34 straws but that is nowhere on the package  this definitely is a mix it is not a single flavor which is nice and exciting for the kids
i buy these monthly and i have no complaints  i dont mind the boost of energy these give you  the only thing missing is iron which i dont think is ever contained in a daily vitamin anyway
bought these for my husband and he loves them we use them about three times before throwing away
easy to carry and works perfectly
weird texture not so good
lathers nicely convenient pump moisturizing but smells like a cheap pina colada you wish you hadnt bought
works well with all smoking parts worth the extra 2 to get the cap holes for stems and bowls
great addition to shaving cream this glycerin really helps shaving cream retain water in its lather  this seems be the secret to a thick and rich shaving cream that one whips up with a shaving brush the quart size is a great value i only have one minor complaint  the bottle does not have lid that lends itself to controlled dispensing i addressed this minor quibble by using an old squeeze bottle with a dropper top
i have cspine injury i am treating with decompression therapy in doctors office  this device allows me support and decompression like therapy at home and is easy to use adjustable tension to fit your needs a little uncomfortable on the ears takes some getting used to
its fine i have my preferences over this this is a nice blend of various collagen sources bovine marine poultry eggshell and therefore a wider degree of collagen types 1 2 3 5 10 hence the elevated price tag i dont rate on price but i will comment that it should be compared to others of this ilk it is with similar price range some sources are more expensive some sources dont require as much to be effective ie bovine is cheapest but needs more marine is usually most expensive yet needs a lot less this has a good amount well fair amount per serving at about 8 grams of collagen peptides hydrolyzed meaning it is broken down to readily absorbable easily digestible form and it mixes in hot or cold without gellingmulti forms can impart a slight smell and flavor i think the ones that use eggshell tend to have a little extra aroma may disappear depending on what it is being used in or might be noticeable not a big fan of it in my plain black unsweetened coffee but is totally fine in a smoothie or when i have a coffee that i doctor up with cream and flavor syrup i dont fault the brand as it is merely a facet of the composition i will always used collagen often single source but will pepper in multi source as i see fitthis is a perfectly fine product though i recommend that they actually include a picture of the nutritional information we dont need to see half a dozen pictures of people drinking it let us know what is in it had i been shopping around for it i would have passed this over for a listing that tells me all that i am gettingthough i am pleased to see thisif youre not 100 satisfied with your purchase well issue you a refund
these all smell great and worked well very moisturizing and fun to use in the bath we loved each and every one of them
a bit greasy but works well
my partner likes to fall asleep to youtube podcasts and not the quiet kind either music laughter i cannot tune that stuff out bought this pillow mat in desperation not really trusting reviews but it honestly and truly works he puts it under his head and i cant hear a thing i cant even tell its on  he says its perfectly comfortable much more comfortable than headphones or headbands with speakers some people say the wire breaks after a lot of use honestly i dont care i mean i hope it holds up but since this is the only solution that works for us well just spring for another onethe only downside is he cant use it very well when hes sitting up in bed so we need both headphones and the pillow mat
these were great tissues good for dry noses as well
nice small and powerful
comfortable fit well good value for price
ive been using this tumeric for over a month now and its a good product
this is a very cool scale i have a fitbit zip and i have the app on my android phone when i weigh myself the weight and the body fat percent travels right over to my phone it took a little while to understand how to set it up but it works great and i love it
this is significantly larger than most adjustable adult collars and after having it on for only a half hour the velcro that the strap attaches to came off not nearly as good as the ones we used to keep on the ambulances im a former emt in one of the busiest jurisdictions in the country just for some perspective im really only giving it two stars because its nice to see one in olive drab instead of blue and yellow
bought these for my husband as certain shoes were rubbing on ankle bone and irritating fit him well and cushion stays in place easy to hand wash and dries overnight good product would buy again
this is a great way to get zinc which has so many valuable properties for health just a few good tasting drops per day of this readily absorbed form and youre good to go one less capsule or tablet to take good value
the big question  can you tell its fish oil not really  its orange flavored which does a good job of masking the taste and you really cant tell that theyre fish by nature  not saying that theyre a perfect orange flavor  theres something undefinable about the taste that is just a little odd but if i told you they were gummy candies you probably wouldnt bat an eyelash  decent omega3 content and if you dont like the pill version of fish oil this will work quite well
ive had very good results using this toothpaste after a couple of weeks its very pleasant to use with a nice aftertaste and it leaves my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean i have noticed some whitening as well three tubes for the current price of 1899 is a decent deal
doesnt work all the time
perfect for variety of holiday gifts
great product quick delivery very satisfied
as expected  good quality  bandaids
i got these as a gift and will not return them but they are very clunky to walk in massage barely noticeable while standing and very  i mean annoyingly loud buzzing while sitting cant hear tv over the buzz was a nice thought for a gift i wouldnt recommend them
dear cats decided to hurl my old one off my desk and cracked the lid in halfso i got this replacement its the same but was hard to get together and hard to get apart and rattledi got some vaseline ran a little around the grooves and now its easy to open easy to close and doesnt rattle feels much better yay vaseline
not a bad taste at all
the dont scrub like i wanted
when growing up we often had a battery bag which contained batteries of various sizes and makes which had been pulled from electronics or opened battery packages and were still good in one way or another i am a creature of order however and such slapdash methods are no longer satisfactory to me especially since there is the possibility of a circuit being created in there between cells of various sizes and chargesthis is a far more elegant solution i have these sorts of holders for every kind of battery i own and they are all neatly stored in a ziplock bag in a box i always know exactly how many batteries i have and thus when i need to order more the cells are kept isolated from oneanother and in tight formation i even keep a couple in my hiking pack  no digging around the bottom of the bag for a stray aaa attempting an escapeif i am giving someone a gift which requires batteries i will usually include a holder like this with it filled with the appropriate type of lithium cells the presentation is onpoint and it ensure that not only can they use the gift immediately but can continue to use it for the next couple years or sothe build quality is good the batteries are easy to insert and remove and the clear plastic leaves no question as to how many cells are in the holder and what sort of cells they arewould recommend
do not waste your money  these are a joke  they wrinkle up once they get wet and then the center never dries  its like trying to wash with a wrinkly piece of cardboard
i bought this  because my dr reccomendedit works great
these disposable masks are like every other 3ply disposable mask of this type that i tried so far they have comfortable ear elastics and the mask is pleated and moldable to the nose with the interior wire  there are 50 masks in this package  the current price of 899 is a great deal for 50 which comes to 18 cents each  since these are disposable they are not designed to last obviously
the flavour is very good and it keeps me feeling my best with better energy and digestion and i take it daily
i like this product it does the job i just dont like how if you dont wipe it totally off theres pink residue that sits on your things i mean unless you know its cleaner it ends up looking gross maybe i just need to do a better job cleaning im not sure
im thinking that this thing wouldve been bigger than that tiny thing ive gotten in my mailed box smh but guessed wrong smh ive had kept my money i used it once and didnt have my skin feeling flawless right so im better than using my hands instead of using this seriously omg when i washed my face with my hands it feels super flawless soft and also right with the face washed i gotten from the store makes its super flawless soft and cleaned as ever hands down seriously god bless
these fit my sons toothbrush perfectly and they work just like the ones that came with it
i been looking for one of these for a good price and i came across this one study and heavy and really works there is different heads and the speed is gradually increased so that you wont be hit with a woop quickly i like the one with the round tip for specific points to focus one battery like is good too since i used for about a week without recharging it
i am always on the lookout for some good mangesium powders  i use them at night before i go to sleephow this comesthis comes in a glass jar and is well packedfullthe jar in the photo was taken after i only took two scoops of product  the fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is  it really should be a bit fuller than it waseasy to takethis is not difficult to take  it is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink itflavori did not find the flavor offensive  some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag  this one was not like that for me at all  it is actually pleasant to take uncluttered with sweetnersdoes it helpthis is really helpful to relax me at nightthe bottom linethis powder is pleasant to take  it is not cluttered with stevia or other additivesmy ratingfive stars i am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added  i only wish it was a little fuller
very difficult ft tissues

i understand the chemistry behind hydrogen peroxidebased cleaners  but even so this product seems to work better than it should  i was cleaning around the door knobs of our exterior doorsyou know  the areas that always become soiled on a door  the dirt and soil just seemed to be evaporating  in other words i wasnt seeing most of the dirt and soil transfer to the paper towels i was wiping with  it was just disappearing  amazing stuff
capsule was deflated i brought the capsule to my physical therapist who recommended the device the pt said the capsule was deflated meaning there was not enough gelatin inside it for the device to perform what it was meant for

this was a reorder
70 alcohol was hard to find and somewhat expensive due to covid scare
ive reviewed a lot apple cider vinegar gummies and these are my least favorite of all of them  the flavor is just ok and the texture is not very gummylike  i like that these have the mother but thats about all they have going for them except for a little b9 and b12 vitamins
there are two slimprofile sixcell travelsized pill cases in this package along with 54 labels each of the cells has a good clasp that snaps tightly shut in my photo i was able to fit 20 of my 50mcg d3 tablets into one cell their portability and slimprofile are the best features note that it will not store more than a couple of  horsesized pills and may not be able to store any depending on the size of the capsule the cell covers do not fully stay open when removing or inserting the pills so be prepared for it to stay only partially openalso note that there is a right way and wrong way to insert the case into its holder the side with the finger nubs on the case is the correct faceup position to insert the pill case with the lids facing up it does not go in correctly if the case is flippedthe current price of 899 is competitively priced as it comes to 4 per case
solid built  i wish the handle was a little longer
great buy  very happy
i have used these in the past and like them very much for buffing the ends of my nails that are currently having a tendency to chip  for the price these work very well and i would recommend them
when the puppy has an oops i usually use a product with enzymes in it to break down the odors and any oops that needs to be removed this i have been putting on the patio where both go to potty to remove that odor too i have been using this all over the place it takes a while to dry  but it works
i have extremely low blood pressure my cardiologist recommended that i eat more salt unfortunately i was unable to eat enough to raise my blood pressure the pills helped a little more than salting my food now im taking a prescription medication to raise my blood pressure to normal so i dont fall if i stand up quickly

doesnt really clean anything
fabulous stuff for your everyday needs
this made my skin feel so smooth and look so clear
the upside is that this is a very well made little lampits easy to start and produces a hot and steady flameif you need a light duty flame hot enough to heat a test tube or sterilize inoculation needle its just fineif you need a bigger flame as standard wick based lamp is betteri use everclear as fuel as i needed non toxic vaporsover all a well made product
i have been mixing this powder into my morning smoothies not part of a workout routine just for added energy and nutrition i really like it and cannot taste the powder at all i highly recommend this powder my old gripe is that the packaging is a little small or smaller than i expected and there is no measuring spoon or tool included given the size of the container this is to be expected but i wanted to let buyers knowi disclose that i have received this item as a free gift or at a discount when i accept invitations to receive items to review i promise that i will post my unbiased opinion with the intent of helping amazon customers make the right buying decision for them and also to increase awareness of the item that will help reduce returns if i do review a gifted item and the giver of the gift prefers my review to be private between them and i and not posted on amazon publicly i will honor that givers request please note that if this review is labeled verified purchase the item came from amazon stock and you can be assured that what i received is representative of what you will receive when you order from this listing

my 7 yr old granddaughter wears the masks every night and she loves them  she used to wear a plain black mask but no more  sometimes during the day i see her with the mask on top of her head
use these in home security system seem to be just as good as duracell
this is great to get that extra blood flow going and definitely more affordable then some of the other brands if you play sports or engage in high activity i highly recommend this product i use for weights and jogging l arginine is always a good supplement to use
does a fair job whoever  iif you are supposed to prick your finger you need lancelets
these are great measure your calves because it makes a difference if your calves are wide then order accordingly great colors to choose from too
easy to apply and remove they can get slick if your face gets sweaty or oily they are nice and thin so they dont affect the way your glasses fit tremendously other than to give them a little more stability
pretty expensive but does the job
these are delicious to the point that its hard to just suck on them and not eat the bag they didnt do much for my throat but they were tasty enough to take my mind off it they are overpriced though not worth a 50 cents a lozenge
theyre pretty basic and work fine but there are a lot of them so its a good deal
these are the same ones they sell at my gym for 50 cents a pair  they are a bit awkward but considering you wear them for 5 minutes and then toss in the trash they work fine  plus they eliminate any tan lines around the eyes like the aroundthehead eyeprotectors
good valueprice for glass cleaners
right on
this is my third order of this  we both like them  the taste is good and even better when mixed with a little orange juice  this is a good way for us to get added electrolytes and also get vitaminswe like this and are happy to have it
nice and heavy duty was perfect

using it in my car has helped tremendously with pain running up the backs of my legs thank you
this is probably pretty gross i purchased a burn brush to clean out my coffee pot and remove seven years of build up inside of it but it was still a little unsettled but maybe the inside of the pot was not 100 cleaned so i purchased this and put some in the pot left it in there for about for five hours and then poured it out and then looked inside the pot and it was shiny include stainless steel which was excellent i rinsed it out twice this morning i had my 1st cup of coffee out of the pot and it tasted great well ive been missing over the last couple years of not having a totally crystal clean product i recommend the strongly i will definitely repurchase this in the future and plan on using it on a regular basis to avoid seven years of scale that was disgusting
thumbs up
ive taken this product for years and ive watched the price rise from 40 to almost 70  since i never wanted to run out i order a few in advance and they come wrapped in a plastic you cannot see through  the instructions have always been 2 scoops a day  but now without every saying a word they doubled the size of the scope but didnt increase the amount of product  its literally twice the size  so now you are getting a crap load of filler and using twice the product so twice the price without you ever noticing  ill use up what i have because its too late to return but i will never buy from this company again  what a total bate and switch
best wrap made
these are actually really tasty  i use them for a quick breakfast on a busy day and honestly they keep me full until lunch  i also like these for those exhausting workout sessions  perfect for and all day hike also  taste is like a peanut butter cup with a smooth chew texture  easy to break into 1 hour portions if your on a grueling day and want to portion this out  great protien content and calorie ratio  this is a real winner
i suffer from a chronic pain condition and sadly have found it necessary to buy a seat for my shower because i can no longer stand up long enough to shower without intense pain i am on the younger side and the idea of having a medical supplies looking seat in my shower embarrassed me so much well having a seat at all embarrasses me but we do what we have to right so i was thrilled to find these cute little bath stools i was worried it wouldnt hold up as well but so far its really perfect its comfortable doesnt take up much room in my shower and its cute people think i bought it to get a spa like experience in my shower which works for me ha ha  the legs look thin in there photo but it has zero issues holding me up and its perfectly sturdy claims to hold up to 300lbs and i feel safe using it thanks to the company who makes these giving us more stylish choices for products we really wish we didnt need
seems like a quality product i mixed a scoop with water ice and frozen banana for a quick protein smoothie it tasted great and was filling and satisfying
good product
this is the 3rd different brand i have tried and this one stands out  its greener tastes fresher and seems more aliveone small complaint and its very small is its a little hard to get the lumps out no big deal really  i just put about 12 cupcool water in a glass and stir in the barley and wheat grass i have to smash the lumps against the side of the glass butthis one tastes so alivei would not trade it
very practice and useful tool use it everyday
simple to use works awesome
i use it on sunglasses that do not have grip on the nose part it works just as advertised need to bring a few extra pairs during travel since at some point you may need to change them due to sunscreen usage continuous use with activities
needed for back pain and its been working just fine
as it turned out i have not used this product yet  it was suggested that i take it on a vacation but i encountered no blister problems  however another person borrowed it and said it helped their foot feel betterl  the blister never did fully develop
my dentist recommended this type of tooth brush i like the feeling of the brush on my sensitive mouth
perfect for my bedside comode
the oil doesnt absorb too quickly but i really like the scent and how it makes my skin feel the smell reminds me of sensual jasmine
awesome kit that i keep near me at all times i keep one in my belt and one in my bag at all times these things are literal lifesavers
works much better than i expected and i adore the handle i can reach everywhere
these ear plugs are great at keeping out noise but not so great for sleeping i find them a tad too hard of a plastic to be comfortable in my ears when laying on my sides i also find my ears itching a lot as well so i have no idea what sort of material these are made of but for sleeping no i would not purchase these again for outdoor work yes they would work just great if they didnt make your ears itch
these hanging witch were a fun addition to the house my wife picked up this one because it was so ugly it was cute she has a habit of doing that latelythese witches are pretty well made burlap makes the dress hat the hair feels like paint brush bristles but it works the faces are well painted and there is a decent amount of detail in the face hands and feet its all tied together with a bit of twine and there you go sit it on a broom with a welcome board attached like swing and there you have iti thought they were so great i bought her two more shes hung in our room they are have slightly  differentshades of burlap to separate one from the other but they made her smile and thats what i was going for i definitely recommend this for the its so ugly its cute person in your life enjoy
promagnetic closure works wellwell madegreat valueconscannot think of any
this is a perfect addition to some walkers  comes with liner that can easily be cleaned up without having to remove the tray from the walker  however pay close attention to the product images    this will not work on all walkers  there must be a crossbar atnear the top of the walker for this to rest on when in service  there is a different version of this tray for those walker without the upper crossbar  this one wont work on most 34drive34 brand walkers but the other one called the 34pivot34 probably will
these help the bursitis in the elbows because they prevent you from accidentally hitting your elbow and feeling the pain
i got this because my physical therapist used it to hold my knee cap inplace while i exercised and made the knee stronger the cap had 34fallen off34 the track it is supposed to be on the tape  lasting about 3 days even in showers etc held strong and was placed below my knee cap as support and around under it  like a  lift  worked well after 23 weeks of usage and changing every 3 days the cap is in place now and no pain
best tongue scraper i have found and the company is super nice  would definitely purchase it again
not sure what kind of aliens we stole this material from but if you have an enamel tub and or tile shower especially white your first mission is to spray some tub cleaner and without letting it sit wipe it with a wet mr clean eraser and prepare to be amazed
i bought this for my husband and he raved about it uses it every day
as expected no concerns
it was a rainy windy day while i was loading my car with groceries from the cart  the cart took a slow turn and rubbed against the entire length of my passenger side audi  there was a black line that stretched from back to front  with light rubbing this product removed the marks  thank goodness
strong soft perfect size for me
i thought these would be perfect for selecting my favorite sneakers and playing golf in them you have to be careful what sneakers you use for this and anything with air bladders is not recommended due to puncturing and also your sneakers are design for a sure footed response with their current soles so when you add these cleats they can be very uncomfortable on your feet when the ground is hard and dry not so bad when its wet and soft overall i lost more than i would have liked and so i have to give these a clear thumbs down
good to add to my 1st aid kits
i travel and camp and this product makes life so much easier i can clean clothes on the go and carry this in my pocket
works great
when i make a mug of coffee if i dont use powdered mct oil then i use this handy dandy convenient single serve mct oil i still get my kick for my coffee it is an oil and it doesnt emulsify that easily but i just stir and drink and ignore any oil sitting on the top of my coffee
ok product low rating due to small loops on belt
it was good for a week and rthen it broke my son plays soccer and has longer hair he needed something to keep his hair out of his face and decided on these he is 11 and they did fit well the bad part was they started tearing after a week of use we did try  and they worked much better they are thicker and made from stretchable fabric we like these much better
this product has ingredients that support natural testosterone production and increase libido the effects are noticeable although i doubt my actual testosterone levels are increased significantly the noticeable effects are more likely due to increased dopaminesome of these ingredients you need to be careful of specifically the ldopa and dhea too much of these supplements can cause anxiety and aggression to my knowledge tribulus does nothing and it is the dominant ingredient the pills have a funky smell which is from the indole3carbinol i3c coverts to dim in your body and dim is in these as well which is redundantanother supplement that seems to work is daspartic acid but this is a bulk powder not a pillnone of these easilyavailable supplements will have a huge impact on your testosterone levels compared to more powerful compounds that are harder to buy but they should help slightlythe current price is 50 which is 083 per serving you might only want to take one pill at a time instead of three
stable high quality stand for the pelvis and spine  there was one review that said it was misleading because he thought it came with the pelvis  if you have been shopping for skeleton models most models cost over 100 dollars  this is a very good price for this stand
this mct oil powder taste ok it needs a few days to get used to it but eventually it works ok
great product just as described and the same thing as in stores
just get it not cheap but i see it as an investment on our health
i cannot remember to take it as required so no results to report but if this continues i will not re buy  thanks
appreciate quality products delivered to my door
these are not your typical gift bags  they are sturdy and can stand up to wear and tear they are not made of paper so they can be reused  in fact if youre giving them out your gift receipent can easily reuse them numerous times so they are ecofriendly i love how glittery they are and they come in a variety of colors  silver gold rose gold i love how they look and they are ideal for gifting small items like jewelry the only thing i didnt like was the gift tags  only one kind is offered thank you i wish they came with a variety of tags as it is they seem made only for thank you swag bagtype gifts
still have cat probs didnt work too good
seems to do what it is supposed to do
this is great i am going to physical therapy right now for knee pain the physical therapist uses one of these on my thighs and calves now i can do it from home or have my husband help i like the grips on this they are very comfortable the rollers are very smooth and dont balk its a perfect size for me to use on myself or for someone else to use on me disclaimer i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review
another spontaneous purchase based on recommendationfind it thoroughly useless  makes too much noise and after having it on for multiple days in a very small walk in closet i saw no improvement in quality of air whatsoeverthumbs down
a great alternative than using bleach tablets
my ability to put on some of my shoes is compromised by arthritis and other problems in my knees and back  this product has made shoes i quit wearing now fully available on a daily basis  this has been a fantastically useful tool for me when i want to wear shoes that do not have a stiff heel
case is well made and safely stores heady glassware at a bargain price
trying to use to cut my own hair  didnt work well  kept slipping
ok so its been 3 weeks and 4 days since ive been taking these breast pills i am seeing a difference but not in cup size im seeingfeeling a lot of firmness and more bouncewhen i touch my boobs they fill like they got bigger but when i look at my before picture i dont see a difference in size but just straight firmness i dont know but i will purchase one more bottle and see if i see a difference i mean if you want results you have to commit on taking them every dayi will for sure reveal the truth  to as if this product worksone thing i do hate are scammers i will be your proofall i know is that if this s dont work in a month i want my money back look for luz zuniga for me to keep you updated
love this product  received what was described and it worked perfectly  i will definitely order again
using alcohol and salt works just as well
material is a little cheap and unfortunately looks it its fine but isnt the best looking like the ombre color but thats a little cheap looking too
fits perfectly and i am a chunky gal holds the sensor in place i thought the green would be more tealish but it is a bright green not horrible though
now i can finally carry my epen with me and get to it fast case is made very nice and durable i love it
i have used this product for 20 years and its awesome  its great for the just got out of bed look and the sexy i didnt do anything to my hair to get it to look this cool look  and as i aged and my hair got thinner the tancho stick gave me the appearance of fuller thicker hair  its one of the strongest hair waxes ive ever found  the only thing i would change about this product is to have it without the lavender scent  people have come to associate this smell with me and i no longer smell it  however if i had the choice i would rather not smell like anything
this provided a nice relaxing bath i personally prefer traditional lavender scents this one smells more floral than lavendery it did bubble and fizz which created  an inviting bath
its a straw and as long as liquid comes up its good color is pretty too
fantastic cafe latte flavor mixes up smoothly tastes incredible i was disappointed to find that this contains sucralose better known as splenda which i do not prefer to consume but this tastes so good and packs enough of a nutritional punch i might overlook that very satisfyingan hour later woke up from a nap with a horrible taste in my mouth brushing my teeth wont get rid of it gaaah the artificial sweetener in this otherwise tasty product is just not acceptable which is really unfortunate i wish theyd either left it unsweetened or used plain sugar
prosi like the scentfeels like a highquality oili am able to sleep after using thisconscannot think of any
could be just a tad larger  i have a small face and they just fit
i have been using the skidmore products for years and have had only superb success with it as an example years ago i bought a butcher block dining room table it had a natural light oiled finish something other than polyurethane i got the bright idea that i should recoat it with a popular semigloss polyurethane coating what a disaster it looked ok for a few months then went downhill from there probably something i did in error during application to be honest after looking at it for years i sanded off the poly and phoned the ownerinventor of the product who is more than willing to give one on one advice that is very nice got simple instructions and i followed them now the table literally looks better than the day i bought it this is great stuff for sure and a little goes a long way too i am absolutely not a carpenter or cabinet maker but this product makes me look like one you cant go wrong as long as you read and follow the instructions my highest recommendation
my daughter has some blood sugar issues that seem to be resulting in dry mouth this toothpaste has made a difference
this is a quick and efficient way to get rid of stains  it works very very well
great value and really nice sponge that has substance to it not just a piece of netting tied together
my wife uses it as our white noise machine for sleeping we hadhave a previous model that is about 15 years old my better half was afraid that it would die any day now knowing that she could not make it through the night without her machine we had to order a backupwe love it
i ordered a few mini snaps by mistake and was going to return them but decided to maybe get something to go with them  this bracelet is perfect  i have the large snap necklace so i have started collecting mini and large snaps
i am very pleased with this sponge the price is excellent the only issue i have is that it doesnt seem to lay the makeup into my skin as well as brushes or fingers i do not contour i just wanted something that would apply foundation faster than a brush its really easy to keep it clean and sanitary i would do 45 stars if i could i gave one to a friend and they are pleased
all of the liquid liposomal vitamin c products that ive reviewed have all had a strong flavor  not bad but some people might like to dilute in water or something i take it straight out of the bottle but the sweetened citrus flavoring is strong i most definitely prefer a liposomal form of vitamin c whether its capsules or liquid liposomal vitamin c stays in your system much longer than the water soluble ascorbic acid which is excreted quickly by the body liposomal means the ascorbic acid is wrapped in a fat blanket sunflower oil and is therefore carried much further and longer in your system fighting cold and flu viruses this bottle of liposomal vitamin c is nearly the same as all the others ive reviewed so theres a lot of them to choose from i can find nothing negative to say about this liquid liposomal vitamin c
i like these bath bombs they actually smell like cotton candy  really beautiful coloring in the bath water
would not recommend this are about as cheap of quality as i have ever seen in reading glasses  broke the first day
excellent blood pressure monitor no more spending money on batteries  charges quickly accurate like the battery operated monitors great price too very pleased
very good results with a pleasant scent  there are so many biting insects here at this time of the year when the monsoons are present  am not outside all day long as it is raining but while i am there and using this avon product the insects stay away  i can actually sit and watch the hummingbirds without being bothered  i am pleased with this lotion and have purchased a second one  would recommend
this stuff is great way better than any other brand even oxiclean highly recommend
it is a little hard to explain the feeling after using this it suppressed coughing for momentarily i didnt use it long enough to say it provided longlasting results my package came disheveled the salt package was open and salt was everywhere there was a tiny crack on the bottom of the inhaler watch out for that i contacted amazon and they refunded my money right away
not as good as the aquacel extra ag but these are much less expensive and work just fine on their own save the super pricey ones for mrsa and stuff
i started seeing a podiatrist about six months ago for horrible plantar fasciitis i purchased these powerstep protech insoles from his office for about 50 these are the same ones i got at his office and they are less than half the costthese are firm and great to add to any pair of shoes its important to note that they are covered in fabric which will wear if you wiggle your toes inside your shoes or if you put extra weight on one side my doctor said i would need to replace my insoles in one year ive actually needed a new pair for about two monthsso im glad ive found these i recommend getting properly fitted for the correct size and getting a proper diagnosis from a podiatrist as no insole is for every foot but im pretty happy i will definitely order these again
this product actually works i dont have back issues i am 130lbs and i do commercial construction i use to come home most of the nights with an achy back working plus wearing a tool belt with this product i havent had an achy back besides when i dont wear this product and its also half way decent its a bit bulky but to save the lower back its worth the sweat
where has this been all of my life this thing is awesome i used it tonight for the first time and it got all of my blackheads i first washed my face then used a hot wash cloth to open my pores then powered on the vacuum on the lowest speed and tada  nose chin and forehead is smooth and soft i recommend this to anyone who has larger pores andor trouble with blackheads you dont need to spend tons of money on one of these this one is decently priced and does the job effectively great purchase
great quality and price

this is a very cute item with a lot of great potential  the trees are adorable and made very well  the little clothes pins are so cute and come with one for each tree so there are no extras in case you lose one  it comes with burlap string so some assembly is required  the lettering is good but not perfect  the last letter s is coming off on my set and some of the letters are glued onto the trees a little crooked  the good thing was that while unpacking the trees they were in order so it was easy to assemble the words merry christmas quickly and easily
this set is made in china and does not have specific brand labeling  so it could be sold as any brand  for that reason youll want to look around to see who is offering the best price  i find the current price of twentyfour bucks to be quite expensive for plastic rods and brushes made in chinathe instructions show that you will probably want to use duct tape to secure each section together after you screw them together  this  is certain true as sections could unscrew as your working the brush backandforth   especially if using a drillyou may also wish to use super glue or some other glue to attach the brush head so that it does come unscrewedthe rods are not that flexible  the more rods you attach then the more curved it can become   but  if you that some tight turns then this may not workthis set comes with two brushes  the bristles are a good combination of flexible  stiff  the  brush is 4inches across and about 175 wide  the brushes must be used separately and can to be attached togetheri wish that someone would invent a dryer vent cleaner where you could attach some kind of hose to a vacuum cleaner  because once you use such a brush    youre going to have to get the lint out  if you have such a hose then you could possible attach it to this brush  pole set
great curling iron
smells nice but total ripoff 799 for a 25ozwhen you can get a 7oz bottle for a dollar more my fault shouldve read teh description plus the picture with all the bottles is misleading you would think you were getting 67 mini cans for 799 but again my fault
this is the best product ever made for mosquitoes and flying insects
over the years i have tried all sorts of conditioners creams serums  sprays  everything new that comes out  i am finished searching for the perfect repair serum this natural repair serum answers all of my problems frizz control  shine is important to me i  also color my hair so this serum helps with the dryness my hair looks shiny  healthy i love to read through the ingredients of natural oils i actually have heard of the oils and i have used the oils before to have these oils all together in one easy to use serum is great i did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion  this bottle will last quite a long time  ill let my friends try it also thank you
i use a lot of stain removers i have a puppy an older dog and older husband and myself we are all stain collectors for me just fixing a mug of coffee will result in coffee on my clothing a nice amount and if we go out to eat i will surely get something that falls on me from the transportation with a spoon or fork my husband always spills his food the dogs leave stains all over the furniture and the floor  especially the puppy he is about all done with going in the house but i dont trust him to always go in the back to go potty so we have stain removers and use them darn near every wash
this all around and only muffles slightly
other than the color i love it  really helps with pain
i have purchased professor amos drain cleaner for years  it has always worked  i may have to use more than one treatment but it will clear your drain
good product smells like curry
its so much nicer to take a shower with a scrubber brush like this one its really soft and feels amazing its really easy tohold onto even when wet its soft bristles provide a nice soft scrubbing massage to get derp down dirt off from skin the ability to reach hard to reach places makes it feel like you have superhuman stretchability great value
this is an ok performing toilet antiodor spray the scent is rather weak compared with other similar sprays ive used but it is reasonably strong its a generic floral scent  not all that different from a general air freshener type of scent but not bad its certainly better than the odor it helps mitigateas with other similar sprays you need to use it before the toilet is used for maximum effectiveness it has limited benefits if used after the toilet is used a fair amount is needed 4 or 5 sprays for good resultscompared with other similar products this is not as potent and just an average value at best three stars
great buy however note the expiration date on the are nearing much sooner than if you buy direct from dr gundry himself which is probably why its cheaper to buy on amazon says good for use upto 2 years beyond manufacturers expiration
we needed this little battery for our security system  could not find it anywhere  price is reasonable and i will be reordering more soon  if anyone needed this type of battery i would recommend this panasonic as it does last very long  we also changed out the battery in our fire alarms as it is very important to make sure your fire alarms are working for your safety
this is the best i will buy more when i run out
looks exactly how its pictureda little pricey but its nice
i bought this shower bench to be able to shave my legs or sit to take a shower when sick it looks great in my shower is the correct height for shaving legs and very sturdy
just needed the clip but it does not open
great toothbrush soft my dog tolerated it very well
these are nice files for the price they file well leave nails feeling smooth and theyre washable ive had them a few months now and my file hasnt dulled or lost strength excellent purchase
i bought two of these i have an expensive one at home and needed something smaller and less money for work and for when i travel though it may not be as powerful as my expensive one at home it does the job i keep the one at work in a cosmetic bag with toothpaste toothbrush and a small mouthwash and its perfect to tote to the restroom after lunch and keeping my teeth clean the other is in my travel cosmetic case so when i go out of town  i just charge it up and off i go for 999 you cant beat the price
im a big fan of generic stuff including tissues until i actually have a cold and then i want the real deal  kleenex these are just softer and smoother with no shedding compared to the off brands sneezing or just a runny nose means lots of tissues and these do not make your nose sore this 8 box batch means we can keep them handy in every room
it is what a expected scent isnt very strong but it coats well and does the job keep it in plastic bag so it doesnt  dry out glad to not be buying plastic throw always will buy again but waiting to see how long this will last so far good over a few weeks
order the ones for fingers and toes got the ones for toes only  returning
i need the natural skin healing for my eczema spots that will itch and be noticeable if i didnt have clothes over them but then you have to itch through your clothing i can use this on my face for the scales and also on my body double duty smells good too
i really like these wipes theyre small i keep a package in my car and work great to clean up your face or other parts not just for kids
dont waste your money if looked great when i received it but it wont fit on any of my cabinets
i didnt really know what i was getting into ive been discovering all sorts of new beauty and health tools  mostly good  and was especially excited to see this might help my hair i didnt really know what i was getting into here thankfully i read the instruction manual before starting and saw the warning about using this if you have metallic implants i messaged eternal clear and received a speedy response that it was safe to use this as long as i stayed 15 away from my metal rods yayso i had already noted that everything arrived safely neatly boxed and sealed i was worried the bulbs were defective at first because they didnt light up right away i wasnt even sure if they were supposed to but i persisted and eventually they all lit up i dont know if it was a coincidence but one finally lit up when i moved my hand closer toward it they all seemed to light up much easier after the first time the electric buzzing and smell is kind of scary but as soon as i was told i could proceed i plucked up the courage to try this on the lowest setting im not even sure it was a setting because theres a pretty wide range between on and where the dots indicating intensity start im slowly working on getting used to the sounds smells and feel first i found the dial easy to turn im proceeding cautiously but optimistically
my favorite of all the wen i tried
very difficult to use very hard to get out of the tube a caulking gun would have been easier
very thin does not feel the same as brand name
look no more red nose but no more money for the love of tissues please
easy to install and easy to cleangood value
i have ordered these twice and really like the soft packaging  it is perfect for the car and any other place in the house the quality is great and the price is great
a little confusing to maneuver
bought the dogthemed matches for friends bought these matches for myself  cutethe matches themselves are low quality but the dressedforsuccess cats are purrrfect meow
my son loves it good taste
i initially was concerned after opening the package when i realized that this device is intended for the outflow port from an hvac system while many people have the vac portion of the hvac system my house is equipped just with the hv  heating and ventilationafter looking at my setup a bit and pondering i reached out to the manufacturer mammoth and asked for some guidance on installing into my systemafter sending some pictures back and forth we came up with a good solution to attach the unit to the sidewall of one of the heating unit which would purify anything entering into the systemthe quality of the parts are great  the lights give a satisfying sound when connecting to their receptors and the status lights that indicate when it is safe to service the equipment or not are a great added benefitthe included template for cutting into your system is very important as without it this task would be substantially harder
great item cleans your contacts really good
item as described good cleaning item
i love this product as a night moisturizer takes a jiffy to get the amount right but it is so absorbable its really not an issue think you will love it
makes good party joints almost two zigzag papers long  too long for my daily use and no extra belt like the smaller raw rollers but a fine machine none the less  colorado approved
this set has all the basic scents to get you started you can use the different scents and blend them to make your own scent to have in your home many people use these in the humidity type diffuser and others use the diffuser that does not use water i dont use water and i get some times scents in my home
great product
bought for a xmas present and she loves them
the rice was delicious
super cute and be warned that these are a bit time consuming to put together but well worth the time

worked twice second time wouldnt even come on for five minutes so it really worked once then no lights no heat made in china garbage  in the process of moving i dont have a printer to return so this is beyond inconvenient and with a stiff neck running to print labels and return second time this weeki guess im just frustrated with being the best nation on the earth and having the crappiest products on the planet because of china and the terribke deals we have made in this county im done shopping online because of this
this is a really coollooking shaver my son is into skulls and thinks this is the neatest thing ever he says all of the shaving and trimming functions work quite well which was a bit unexpected for a seemingly novelty device but when it comes to the brushes they dont clip into the base and stay there therefore once turned on they can fall out at any time the instructions do say to attach the brushes place them against your face and then turn the shaver on so maybe they are just held on by pressure the instruction booklet is a good size and readable which is a plus in my bookaside from the brushes not snapping into the shaver as all the other attachments do this shaver looks cool and also functions very well i would definitely recommend it especially for skull lovers and teenage boys just starting out shaving 4 stars
great teeth  gums supplement  after only 4 days use my gums are pink  redness has cleared up i like the clove taste  numbing effect teeth feel stronger  set firm in gums too they seem to be whiter even tho i drink coffee  tea yay
i was expecting a three pack from the picturenote to self always read what is included especially since this indicated 90 capsules and that is what i got i got to this review too late in the day to try it but tomorrow morningwatch out i am back and it is the next day i took the diet capsule and now waiting to see if it curbs my appetite
flavor is the first criteria i review when reviewing energy drinks and i have reviewed a lot of them  its still too much on the sweet side but almost all of them are  i dont know why they have to be so sweet i usually add limelemon juice to them to cut the sweet  that said i play two hard sets of singles yesterday in the hot sun and had my water bottle filled with this energy booster  i felt ok for the most part playing in the sun really saps my energy so knowing that i was still going pretty strong towards the end of the match tells me this stuff must be helping
this is basically a heated pad with a removable shield to keep the heat in it looks like carpet in the pictures but its a plastic like material thats not a bad thing since its easy to wipe off but i wanted to note that its not a soft carpet the heat is concentrated in the center of the mat but my feet stay warm on the edges too with the shield on its a welcome addition to my chilly office
from what i have heard described about other rolling machines of this type they break easily  this one which is made of hemp plastic i am sure will last a very long time and its very easy to uselove it
this double sided brush is decent for dogs my only issue is that after a few weeks the bristles start coming out it is not a very durable brush
steps are clearly numbered and stated on the items so there is no confusion or mistakes best i have owned
was hesitant to buy cordless as my other cordless esp for cats didnt cut through mats easily  by the time i pulled his hair 2 or 3 times he bit showing his irritationand then i was irritated too  this holdog cordless pet hair clipper came today and my cat was been quickly dematted  it had a 60 charge and i waited a couple minutes to get 100 charged very quickly  i love the lcd display  the blade was easy to take off and reassemble so i oiled and cleaned the clipper before and after use  this time i got a kitty kiss  we are both happy love it  and for the price amazing
took care of arm pain nerves that was result of shingles  was able to go to sleep
good cotton balls used mainly for removing nail polish  they held together well
worked great
didnt mean to order this but im glad i did works as advertised i like that it folds around my straighter too chi approved
this package came with two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam ear plugs one sleep mask is black on both sides and the other has purple on one side and black on the other  the fabric is smooth and soft against the skin the elastic band that holds the mask on is doubled over and is adjusted by sliding the fastener rather than with a bulky snap or velco closure i find this closureadjustment method more comfortable than my current sleep mask the mask is thick enough to block light and the mask does narrow as in has a cut out in the nose area for a somewhat better fit but there is no molding or pillowed area to hold the mask above your eyes or fill the gap created between the cheek and the nose so light does get under the mask the mask lies directly against my eyelashes and i dont really care for that the stitching is neatthe mask measures 85 across by 4 high or 35 high where it dips up at the nose area the elastic can be adjusted between about 8 to 15 of length for a total mask  elastic length of 165 to 235
this smells different than their other dreft ive got in the past and i love the update it smells so good and not too intense the box reduces plastic waste and is recyclable easier and more convenient to use than a pour plastic bottle just a warning to turn and open the spout slow because it will come out fast if not ive been using this on our daughters clothes and cloth diapers and it cleans very well and makes everything smell great
i cant tell you how much i appreciate the wide flat bases of these ziplocs i like to make ahead and freeze meals and its often awkward to fill them without someone else holding them open these stand up by themselves and make it so much easier love them
as many others have said these are 2 oz cups theyre also poorly packaged  just shrink wrapped so at least a dozen are crushed or otherwise damagedpity because theyre a cute pattern might keep havent decided yet
this is a great quality brush that i got to make the difficult  job of straightening my daughters hair  now it is a little less of a chore for us both this is easy to use and does a nice job in half the time and alot less fuss from my child it can be a bit of a problem when she wants to play and not sit to have it taken care of for any length of time this is a nice way to get her hair done quickly and painlessly so we are both happy it works so well and does a great job it gets hot fast which is great no one wants to sit waiting the handle stays cool so i dont have to worry about my hand burning while i am doing her hair the controls are easy to use and the directions explained everything thoroughly the screen is easy to read her hair brushed right through and it didnt take long for it to look smoother and straight this is a great brush that does a good job i am so glad i found iti was given this brush in exchange for an honest review
no instructions i have no clue what those handle things are for however i did use the stickies to keep the balloons holding together and the long ballon holder
ive purchased for international s america and vietnam travel  when it pours the lotion separates from the insect oil and i have a tough time getting to two to meld
this product made my wifes legs go numb
my wife has major knee issues  i purchased this and installed per instructions  if youre a handy man type this will pose no problem for the installation  the white color matched the white porcelain of the toilet  the base of the toto drake is longer than toilevators 223 inch length and extends off the platform 1 inch in the back  it doesnt effect stability  i know it can hold just over 300 lbs without structural failure in the 2 months we have had iti purchased the item because there were no ada or otherwise round toilets available 35 taller than the drake and this toto has been great operationally and for longevity of parts  with the toilevators 35 lift i kept my original toilet and my wifes knees are much easier to extend when she stands up  i was rather concerned about the weight but it said 500 lbs was the limit  it has proved sound  it has been easy to clean  the toilet hasnt shifted or slid on the base  the bolts extended higher than the top of the toto toilet base  i just purchased a deep cap rather than cut them  all needed items are in the kit except for the deeper bolt cap covers  i also needed a new bowl gasket seals the tank to the bowl as i took off the tank to make handling much easier for methe only issue for me were the closet bolts that were supplied these connect the toilet base and the toilevator to the sewer flange at the floor  the heads of the bolts were round not flat and appeared to be galvanized  they should be stainless steel  they would not fit under the flange  i simply ground the head and sides down a bit till they fit and applied plumbers grease to the threads to prevent the bolt and nut becoming rusted together  years of experience have taught me to think ahead
these insoles are made from eva they are not as durable and give less cushioning than insoles made from polyurethane the insoles i received were much larger than my shoes so i had to trim them down which is a hassle compared to insoles that are properly sized
very comfortable and soft
i love the glitter the mask is comfortable and light enough so its not overwhelming i wear it to my doctors appointments if they are not virtual anywhere i need to go it is appropriate and cute
3 years later there is a leak
fit my device and now i can charge it woohoo
review after one week of use had some doubts that this would work as well as stated for the incredible task  at hand  a laundry room that is the nighttime spot for 3 dogs every morning we open the door and gasp at the horror of the stench a good thorough mopping might clean the floor but the air is rank with stinky dog that no aerosol air freshener can conquer plugged this in as soon as it arrived and within an hour it was pleasant even when the pack comes in wet it has made a big difference now to see how long it lastsupdate after a month the dogs are winning it no longer clears out the smell the way it did in the beginning if my laundry room were bigger id purchase another larger unit like the one we use for the whole house maybe that would work for now we might just have to invest in face masks
i got these to wear to my chemo time they are super soft around the eyes they wrap around and velcro keeping the maximum amount of light out so i can sleep i am so very happy i found these my friend recommended a memory foam style and i never thought of it so i was excited to buy them overall great comfort great sleep quality and very soft on eyes i highly recommend these to anyone
these innocheer 2434 wind chimes with s hook are literally music to my ears i love the sound that they make i moved them earlier today on my front porch so that they would be closer to my bedroom they sound like christmas music to me and such a pretty sound at thati would buy again
i did not attend my expectations  it did not make my feet smooth at all  the motor sounds very cheap  im in the process of returning this product
this really gives a nice stretch  i use it on my office chair daily  ever since i started using this the lower back pain i would have at the end of the day is gone
we are big fans of this flavor and the coconut wish they were less expensive but they arent
i use this form of curcumin more for its ability to cross the bloodbrain barrier neuro protective having said this i also find it to be an excellent antiinflammatory
these are great  best i found so far
this is the biggest piece oh shiiiiiiii i ever bought  it does not even work
i love that this has a sturdy stand and wheels they roll very easy the drying power is very good it dries up rather than down which i think dries the hair faster it was easy to assemble very professional type dryer
great nail file  the 34sand34 doesnt rub off  this is good quality
saw one bottle sitting on a shelf bought it to try out since i get dry mouthed at night but dont want to drink anything this worked well and i just ordered 3 more bottles
ive only taken it about 4 days and can already tell the difference  thank you
nice product but over priced i found it at a big box store for half the price
reading all these reviews and they look and read like the same reviewer dont ya think strange  sobe cautious
cannot get the protector off the brush going to have to send it back
the first time i ordered these i fell in love with them because they where perfect for work but this second time around i found it be a different type of glove as if they changed the product it felted and a different color
i love these bars  they are a bit chewy and can get really hard if theyre cold but i still give them 5 stars bc they are one of the best egg free paleo bars on the market
my posture is excellenteveryone says so smile including multiple physical therapists but i began to have some irritation in my clavicle collar bone area and a new curved car seat back was killing me combined  just awful this gentle posture corrector helps hold my shoulders back thats retraining my back muscles and relieving both issues its easy to don and very adjustable comfortable remember only 30 minutes at a timeespecially to start
i love these nail files as they are the only ones that i will use  thank you so much
i bought hoping to block husband snoring which didnt help well with that  but took with me on a plane ride and it work amazing keeping light from overhead plus helped with using to try to rest
that strap on the back really makes masks stay on better and feel more comfortable but the little cup insert thing didnt really work for me i think you have to have a much smaller than average nose and im not sure this is designed for americans also it doesnt really stay in place but the straps and lanyard thing or useful the rest depends on your facethat strap on the back really makes masks stay on better and feel more comfortable but the little cup insert thing didnt really work for me i think you have to have a much smaller than average nose and im not sure this is designed for americans also it doesnt really stay in place but the straps and lanyard thing or useful the rest depends on your face
better then 300 dollars a box
taste nothing like salted caramel it is nasty tasting and i have tasted way better flavors of whey then this i am a caramel fanatic when i am looking for a good whey that doesnt have hidden sugars and was disappointed that i spent 50 flats on something i expected a way better taste i have to down this drink pretty fast because its not anything i can discribe just not caramel of any means dont waste your money extend has a better flavor then this brand of carmel and you get way more for your money
its heavy duty works well in the kitchen any surfaces that needs cleaning
these suffice for the small amounts of trash i generate the size is good for small to med waste cans the price was right and delivery was fast they do tear easily if heavy or sharp objects are put in
i filled up the soap container and it was very hard to squeeze it out so i just put the soap on the brush and showered that way i like the brush part soft and felt like it was getting the dry skin off but didnt like the fact that the liquid soap was hard to squeeze out it is okay but not as easy as it says in the ad i bought the three pack so i wont be buying it again
like the title says i stuck them to the back of a pair of boots with worn soles to restore traction  there was a maximum area for the pad to adhere and i carefully cleaned and slightly roughened the area to maximize its ability to stickafter just a single wear the pads were starting to come off and after 2 they were completely gone  while they were cheap they were a total waste of money
maca powder is a superfood from peru you can mix some of the powder in your smoothies and you can also add some to your baking it is good for giving you endurance it is very nutritious but also has 20 grams of carbohydrates per serving
we have several similar products in the house  during this covid19 we try to take our vitamins and stay hydrated  this is a very nice item to have around  my wife and i are actually both drinking one nowmy biggest complaint is the salty taste  i know i know it has salt for electrolytes but my other main one we drink doesnt have this salty taste  i just chugged half the bottle and then refilled it with cold water  i like it better when it is diluted  next time i will just use 12 of one tube in my bottle of wateri do appreciate the vitamins and will continue to use this
i really like the idea of this device the vibrations themselves are soothing but because i purchased this to help with long haul covid issues which stem to my understanding at issues with nervous system regulation i didnt consider the fact that one of my symptoms is scalp pain and when im experiencing the scalp pain the location of this device can be somewhat aggravating in addition i had a hard time getting it to rest comfortably behind my ears it had a tendency to move off of my left ear in particular im not sure if its not as suited to certain headear shapesi did find the vibrations to be comforting but it was offset by the discomfort of the pressure on my head aggravated by long haul scalp pain and proclivity to headachesanother issue was that for a product like this i would like to use it more than 2x a day one charge lasts about 4 sessions so it requires frequent recharging if you want to use it more regularly and also using it more regularly i felt more discomfort from the pressure on my headears so not an ideal device for frequent usei only ended up using it a few days before deciding to return i really like the idea and i did enjoy the sensation of the vibration but it wasnt wellsuited for my needs at this time
love it so fresh and coconut is wonderful
if you know and love sangre de grado this is a good one
supplements were a great deal cheaper than the local nutrition store  plan to order again in the future  no complaints at all but just so everyone knows amino acids taste terrible  they also give you terrible breathe while youre eatingdrinking it  just a heads up i wasnt aware of this until after i started them
i have only used the high heel pad for the front of my feet and they were amazing so comfortable heels that i couldnt wear for more than an hour i wore all night
these are the best nail files and buffers to use i am a nail tech and i always use these files since i can clean them after i am done using them and put them in my clients individual tool containers love them a must buy make sure you prep the edges of the files before using them on your clients or on your self since you can cause cuts since they are sharp
although not the most durable it did the job  but if you plan on mailing items using this i wouldnt get this  if its just for gifts that you will transport locally or at your home then it does a decent job
my right foot has a bunion growing bigger and have been looking for something to help ease the pain this bunion corrector does okay but by it being so squishy it isnt really correcting anything all it does is provide a cushion between my big toe and second toe ive turned it go horizontal between my toes and that seems to help better still on a hunt to find something other than surgery to correct iti received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
probiotics are important for digestion and immune health  but they can get pricey  these are reasonably priced and seem to work the same as my regular brand
pain in my limbs have greatly lessened  from taking this  i can finally enjoy walking again
very impressed with this stop and squat foot stool it is made of great quality plastic that is sturdy and has a decent weight to it it is great for people who are shorter than 6 feet and really uncomfortable for someone taller i am 55quot and it works great for me my significant other is 61quot and finds it really hard to use it allows me to have a productive bowel movement and it takes some adjusting for your intestines to understand what is going on lol but i am happy with it and recommend to those who want to have a bm the way man was supposed to have it there is a gap in the middle for you to line it up evenly in front of the toilet great bathroom experience nonethelessi received a free product for the purpose of my review opinions are 100 my own
ive used it twice on wet feet and it works perfectly at getting dead skin off and smoothing
niftalicious
ok doesnt straighten curly hair completely
love these things cant live without them  others have posted they dont work but it takes at least a couple months of constant use to get the full benefit ive tried many other tabs for my joints and will not go back to anything else these make me able to move and not be in such constant knee pain
i love this my son is autistic and so it is a great sensory bath toy for him he loves to hold it and feel it its really flexible as well and he likes when i rub his back with it a great buy
according to the manufacturer fresh aid toothpaste is packed with quality ingredients that target gum diseases like gingivitis and plaque it prevents tooth decay and gum and tooth pain its also the best toothpaste for those with sensitive teeth and gumsthis toothpaste has ginger root extract which i can taste and may partially account for the tingling sensation that stays on after you rinse your mouth out the toothpaste has a yellowish color and kind of reminds me of lemon filling it leaves your mouth feeling fairly clean but there is a lightness to this toothpaste that other white and chalky toothpastes like crest dont havei question whether the lack of fluoride will be effective in the longterm at protecting my recessed gums and preventing plaque from taking hold i usually use colgate total so only time will tell if this toothpaste will be as effective i have been brushing it now for only a week so i will update this review if anything changes for now its an ok toothpaste for those who are concerned with the amount of chemicals in their toothpaste because of my gum issues effectiveness is more of a priority for me so if you have overall healthy teeth and gums you may love it
this product is easy to use and leaves my granite countertops very shiny and looking great  it also has a nice clean smell  simply spray it on and rub with a dry cloth  the can lasts a very long time and it is a great value
just like all the other comments that i did not listen to the liquid will never go through this tube it wont work
this is a very nice modern scale  it take 4 aaa batteries and were easily installed in the scale  this is a very nice scale and it looks great in my bathroom  love the glass  seems to be accurate when it comes to weighing on it  overall i am very satisfied with this scale  it has met my expectations and does not look cheapi received this scale for free for testing and reviewing purposes  this is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to this conclusion by using the scale myself
my family constantly has problems with ear wax build up it seems like im constantly cleaning them i got this product in hopes of making it a little less scary than scooping it out it does an okay job  i think i need to work with it more to figure it out  bottle worked as advertised
seems to put more of a strain on the oral b to move the brushes than the factory brushes  i think i well go backto the oral b
ive been using the aria for about a month now and im really pleased with it i like that it takes a new measurement every time you step on ive had some scales in the past that didnt seem to budge unless you lost or gained a pound or two and sometimes that big jump was quite unwelcome it measures quickly identifies me and syncs right to my fitbit account immediately i was initially concerned because the bathroom that it is located in has the worst wifi connection in my whole house but so far i havent missed a single reading on itthe bodyfat  definitely does fluctuate but as im familiar with other devices that measure bodyfat i also know that things as simple as whether your stomach is empty or full and how dehydrated you are can cause this to fluctuate quite a bit the percentage itself might not be extremely accurate but if you weigh yourself at the same time and under similar circumstances daily ie first thing in the morning before youve eaten or had anything to drink then it is accurate enough to let you know whether your percentage is increasing or decreasing over time this isnt a professional bodyfat measuring tool and its unreasonable to expect it to work as well as oneim the only one currently using my scale so i cant comment on the difficulties some people have with multiple users or guest users setting it up was extremely simple and now i dont have to wonder if i remembered to log my weight in my fitbit account or not in fact now i cant do things like 34forget34 to log my weight after a rough weekend i like to know where im at on my journey so i dont find myself avoiding getting on the scale to avoid having the weight logged which i was actually worried about overall it has just become a comfortable part of my routine and caused me to have to be a bit more accountable to myself im quite happy with my aria
i have been using it and has a nice flavor very effective
given as a gift much appreciated and comfy for patient
it was a gift they loved it
no do not use magic erasers on anything i cant believe they are even still selling any of these things they serve no purpose and will damage anything they touch if you care about the surface you are about to clean keep these things away or the surface will be damaged
these adult diapers are soft and comfortable to wear also quite absorbent  my only issue is that the cute design looks like baby diapers
not the same as the picture
this are super colorful great gift giving holiday bags and tags i always give smaller gifts to neighbors sometimes home made baked goods sometimes a bottle of wine these bags are perfect for this the drawstring is made of ribbon and seals the bag well these would also be great for packaging teachers gifts or for family gifting highly recommend nice variety nice colors
fits great
i love this pillbox with fox hunt theme
in the clouds god bless
returned it  didnt work for me
i just cant seem to wear any other type of nose pads than these selfadhesive soft pads i have tried at least 5 or 6 other kinds and i always come back to these they are so much more comfortable on the nose and i have a very small nose bridge these come in different colors and have been the only ones worth the expense
i like these bags they do clear odors in  enclosed spaces
i am not going to be ugly  but this was the worse 900 i have spent and that is all i have to say about it
ive bought several of these kits and i finally figured out why this isnt working for me a lot of the breakfasts and lunches are very sugary bars which later make me feel like im starving  i think its the sugar for one thing a granola bar in my opinion is a pretty lousy breakfast or lunch not very filling and not much nutrition then after you eat these you crash from the sugar high and are starving i ended up eating eggs on the days that i was supposed to have the bars and i have bars left over weight loss was zero  i lost on nutrisystem before but that was when they had artificial sweeteners for those who want to know this is low fat low calorie high carb high sugar  i do like most of the dinners
last minute gift for a 15 year old hockey fan arrived on time  he appeared happy cant comment on the game as we did not play
while its not a new neck it does help keep the existing one freer from strain and tension it fits right at the bend of the neck and if you lay on it regularly it helps ease shoulder tension i put it on the floor and just relax into it and it works the best if im trying to watch tv or something it doesnt have the same effect but just relaxing or listening to an audiobook music podcast its very effective
bought as part of a gift for a soap making kit and it was well received a little bit makes a lot of soap so this was a great valueupdate still 5 stars made soap regularly for 6 months with these before finally having to order more fantastic lather and has made great soaps
exactly what i expected thanks
nice strong pumpi have two one purched from here and one from another online vendor moves more coolant than i had anticipated right now i have the pump maxed but i will be taking it down to a lower setting i dont need the flow that it is set on now i have two of the pumps tied in a series using the koolance rp452x2 dual 52534 reservoir had a aio pump die on me in the past so this series setup should allow for redundancy
unfortunately it did not remove the odor as i had hoped
i use only 14 to 12 tsp if i have leg cramps this works the best my dad had hand cramps and within 15 mins of giving him 12 tsp the cramps were gone i love that i can vary the dose  check out dr carolyn dean
loved the variety
please use vinegar for weeds and not poison  as a cancer surviver i would never use poison when vinegarworks  i add dishsoap also and it works great  spray when weeds are small and you use much less product and nip it in the bud before weeds get out of hand  i always use vinegar 30 straight with added dishsoap perfect safe and simple
best natural 0calorie sweetener out there imho  absolutely no aftertaste and tastes just like regular sugar  it can be cooked with but if the item is something like a jam best to add at the end of cooking  with baking youre supposed to add 14 more but i like it a bit less sweet so just add the amount in the recipe  perfect for adding to dry cereal
looking forward to using these with our cloth diapers  durable and waterproofrevised review we have been using these for awhile and they are wonderful the drawstrings arent super helpful but we dont need to use them that way amazing quality and great use we are nearly a year in
perfect size leaves residue on hands after handling
product did not work do not waste your money
great case you wont be disappointed
the mats are very easy to use they fit together and separate with ease  the thickness is great my pins do not poke through  they also allow for very fast drying time overall these are excellent
ive used quite a few keto supplements and this one is nasty i could hardly even get it down didnt bother drinking another one its really bad and didnt get the energy the same as the ptks disappointed
i cant remember the last time a purchase made me this happy doesnt matter what season it is my feet develop thick calluses and crack open and bleed not just on the heels  i have used all manner of graters sponges files microplanes etc and while they make my feet smoother i cant get rid of the calluses  the emjoi did what all of those other methods could never accomplish  my feet are indeed smooth and soft after using it just a couple of times  and oddly enough even though it took the calluses down more completely than the other methods it seemed to be gentler on my skin than the other tools which often left me with sore or bleeding feet  i will sing emjois praises from the rooftops lol
works really well  one application was all i needed for a pair of older stinky sneakers  will definitely buy again
after trying a ton of different metal nail files these are the only nail files i buy
i love this thing i have a messed up foot from a call several months ago and this really helps when it gets tight or painful the pressure is greati vary it depending on needs i use it approximately once a day and have had no problems i use the heat occasionally and it is meh
this is useless  you have to place your entire mouth over the opening and then exhale  i dont see how you could use this while driving or anythingelse
i hate how so many supplements use artificial sweeteners that make everything so sickeningly sweet this protein powder is actually not as sweet as many that ive tried definitely more of a natural amount of sweetness that i really appreciate tastes just like a sweetened creamy latte i add this to my morning coffee and its just perfectthis doesnt state whether it has caffeine in it or not but i dont believe it does despite the cold brew flavorthe reason i took a star off was the packaging i was super excited to receive a bagged protein powder because the super large and usually half empty containers of protein powders take up so much counter space unfortunately it just doesnt seal back up very well did not feel air tight at all i didnt want it to lose freshness so i just put it in a different container wish the sealing strip had worked better
heavy duty caps fit tight could be larger
this tiny pill is super easy to swallow and doesnt contain ingredients that would exclude its use for people with celiac disease or dairy or soy sensitivities though it didnt mention anything about being vegetarian they are also chewable
dmso is a carrier product to be applied on clean skin away from cut sores and only to be used externallyapply a little with sterile cotton let dry and apply ie icy hot or pain medicine may give a licorice taste in mouththis should only used for severe pain check with your health care provider

got  the clay model and i found it very difficult to warm in my small microwave  ive got a turntable and this wrap is large and difficult to pack inside you end up having to fold it over and then it never heats evenly  once i did get it warm enough it was awkward to wear because the weight it at the bottom so it ends up pulling downward and  choking youthere is a rather flimsy strip of velcro that is supposed to hold it together but it looked like an amateur job i expected this to be much nicer based on reviews i had read
this is giving me alot of relief on my back and legs dont fall asleep
i have referred this product to many clients  all of thiers have worked very well unfortunately mine has never worked  the company has not responded to my calls to ask questions
slow results strong chemicals
been taking this stuff daily for a couple of months and have noticed a sizable difference in the reduction of lower legcalf cramps from what ive found this is the only supplement where you can get 1000mg of potassium in one scoop otherwise it is sold in 50mg pills which would take forever to get to the minimum recommended 3500mg a day and you need more if you are nursingi put this in with about 14 cup warmed water 30 sec in microwave  it seems to dissolve better in warm water and then i mix it in with 20 oz of flavored water it does alter the flavor a bit but you get used to it
these have a great taste but after about 2030 minutes i have the nasties belches cant say if they are working but i am still taking them
i take this for sleep regular bowel movements along with one dulcolax every now and then since i have diabetes and my bowel has slowed down i take two every night and it really helps the heart read up about magnesium it helps a lot of things including muscle cramps
does it work probably notdid it have some placebo effect maybe a littlewould i buy it again definitely notthanks for coming to my ted talk
the only cleaning solution to use
love using these on my contacts they always feel so refreshed in the morning
works great  very easy to use
nice product but the extended button causes it to pop open in my pocket a lot oh well
i bought this to catch the few stray hairs missed by several rounds of laser hair removal on my legs the epilator requires multiple passes on some patches i feel it pulling but it doesnt get everything i havent used an epilator since the 1980s so im not sure if this is how they all are or if this one is weak in any case having the electric razor option is nice for the few i cant get i have also tried the heel sander on my feet seems okay but i didnt buy it for that
i love my little witchshe is perfect
thank god they make a liquid version of astaxanthin my husband can not swallow pills and this is the only liquid astaxanthin i have found antwhere its pricey but its the only one around so we continue to buy it astaxanthin is very good for your health its a super antioxidant wish they made a chewable gummy for kids we take our astaxanthin daily as part of our everyday supplements my husband has not complained of any taste aversioni mix this in with his liquid fish oil and add it all to a small shot glass of juicehe drinks it every morning poor guy but what can you do when he cant swallow pills he doesnt complain just drinks it down
i love the portability of the individual days of this pill case attache it is great for 2xs per day doses however i have a few dislikesloves each day is portable each side is large enough to hold about10 pills as long as they are not super large i find it easy to fill the pu carrying case makes the pill compartments easy to carry dislikes the pill cases are tightly enclosed in the case making it a bit difficult to remove each day there is no am pm written on each cell instead there is a moon and sun the days written on the side of the case are only one one side since the cells move around in the case the day of the week is not always visiblein summary even though this is large i like that each circular day container can be taken in a purse for one day and there is no need to take the entire container they also hold a sufficient amount of pills for me unfortunately my dislikes have me rating this case 3 stars the current price of 1099 is reasonable for this and a lot cheaper than the same case in black that is 5 more by another vendor
very happy with this  i spent a lot of money 3 years ago for a teak bench which eventually rotted out and took up too much space in my tiny shower stall anyway  this is lightweight and comfortable i can shave my legs  probably best for younger folks not afraid of falls  a frail person should seek something sturdier but it is exactly what i needed
i bought 2 in different colors  one holds a nebulizer and all its parts in one place  the other holds personal home medical equipment  no more bulky boxes  the different colors helps separate things  and family members can easily find home medical supplies

im doing a 5x5 stronglifts program and my squat weight is getting pretty heavy for me i weigh 185 and probably around 240 i started to feel a little pain in my knee at the bottom of my lift nothing super bad but just a little instability if that makes sense anyway these things are amazing they provide that little bit of compressions that just makes everything feel right im up to 260 now and squatting 45 times a week super nice product cant go wrong i also used their sizing chart and it worked perfect went with the large for my 15in pattela measured right around the center of my knee with my leg straight
shaves well  the first one i ordered stopped working after 5 months of use however the seller was kind enough to provide a replacement
works as expected
this is exactly what i was looking for and what a great price  these were much more expensive in the store
cheaply made
perfect i bought these on the recommendation of kelly starrett from his book ready to runthey are exactly what i wanted sturdy and well made
since we are at 6 million deaths as of today precaution prevails these are great for slipping inside of decent paper masks and probably regular ones i dont know but i put them inside of paper masks when i dont feel like messing around with heavier cloth ones for example at the hair stylist my only complaint is that is actually a compliment they have a little bit of stickiness to the edges so occasionally youll peel them off your face but ive yet to break out or had any residue but i find an unobtrusive and living in a building with long hallways fire doors and non maskers its better to be safe than sorry i can recommend
great scent to the deodorant but this brand was not a good match for my skin type resulting in regular breakouts in my underarms i dont normally have sensitive skin  never had issues with deodorant or antiperspirants in the past
these masks are in my opinion as effective as standard n95 masks and at least as comfortable to wear they foldup very nearly and tend to last me about a week each the ear strings are comfortable and stretch easily theyre a bit sharp on the back of my ears but not unbearably

this body wash smells wonderful the foam makes it feel luxurious too
all of the ingredients in this combination are well thought out and researched and patented potent forms of them are included there is no magnesium stearate etc in the capsules i find that this combination helps keep me focused and yet less stressed sometimes i take in the evening but its equally good in the morning the cost is relatively high for 2 capsuleday use but during a particularly stressful period it is worth it i find taking 1day works for me but my body weight is not much over 100
have to have helps with copd
love this product and that its offered on amazon
honestly idk what im doing wrong but once i put it in it just stays in place with no effort on my part no matter which one or two i use so didnt work for me

i have used and loved this product for years but it was a little green pill  didnt notice when i ordered but these new ones are capsules  they dont seem to work as well for me and wonder if the ingredients have changed
this is a feels review and as such you should seriously question the results my name is paul ive been diagnosed with vitamin d so low it wins limbo contests i have been on various vitamin ds for years every time i get my blood tested its low every doctors like oh well take 5000 a day youll get it back up in no time and for the past 15 years or so ive been taking more than that daily i just burn right through iti also get severe insomnia if i take it later in the day thats generally how i know its working as i have absolutely no method of testing whether this worked other than the feels i took it later in the day than i normally would my globule d3 dose and discontinue that i had severe insomnia for the two nights i tried it later in the day my assumption is that means its either d3 or speedon the feels spectrum it feels at least like what i take for 5000iu i dont know that my body can tell the difference between 5000 and 10000 howeverthe pills are interesting not particularly bothersome no nasty burps post pilli would say these feel effective smell fine take easy as ive been on d3 for over a decade and on these for 10 days it looks like and its now gloomy and falllike out id say theyre working ill update if i feel theyre not but it feel about rightman i hate making feels reviews anyone has a d3 testing blood kit around let me knowonly thing of negative note was there was a sticker over the ingredients when i received this not sure if that was the mfg or amazons warehouse but considering it covered ingredients manufacturer etc i peeled it off attached pic with and without stickerunder the sticker is that its formulated in the usa but nothing to indicate that the formula is actually grown combined packaged in the usa the karamd inc address corresponds to a commercial office space in cleveland but there are no clear markings from street viewi checked out karamd on the bbb as i like to know whos producing things im about to ingest seems like a fairly low rating generally involving sales tax issues some supplements that didnt work couple of complaints but resolved bbb will always have low marks as a note nobody thinks lets go there and rate this random company highly all but one show a response which is a good thing appears youll get a response if it doesnt work theyve been around and are responding in at least publicly a positive fashioni should note im pretty sure 10 days ago the description claimed it was 5000iu in the description text 10000 in the header and 10000 on the product i ended up receiving what im reviewing says 10000 for one pill
exactly what i wanted
it has an small buckle that sit in your ear when you sleep in your side

this is like protein isolates on steroids extra healthy extra protein for muscle fuel plus joint support and soft tissueall in a great taste mixtrust you found this review honest and helpful
this mct oil comes in a fancy wine bottle and it is packaged like a fancy wine bottle it has a slight taste of coconut oil versus other mct oils that have no detectable tasteyou are paying a premium for the presentation of this oil not for the quality of the oil the bottle looks fancy and like a premium product if that is the look you are going for maybe you are buying this for a bar or restaurant where the appearance matters for the oil to be the highest quality it would be better if this was 100 c8 oil other brands try to stand out by selling organic mct oili drink mct oil daily in coffee and i have tried many of the brands another brand i have in my kitchen is the inexpensive horbaach mct oil that costs 015  fl oz this genesis mct oil has the same ratio of oils and costs 148  fl oz premium 100 c8 mct oil is cheaper than genesis mct oilmany mct oil bottles suffer from a pouring problem and drips this bottle pours like a wine bottle which is fine and it has the problem with the last oil drip running down the side like many other bottles i keep my bottles on a paper towelthis mct oil is sold in clear glass versus nearly every other mct bottle being sold i am unaware of any issue with mct oil degrading if exposed to light but it is something to take note of many places caution to keep oils out of sunlight the now brand sells their mct oil in dark brown glassthe bottle says high octane on it which is silly marketing they are likely trying to play off the pioneer in the field of mct oils bulletproof brain octane c8 mct oil which is higher quality and less expensive than this oil octane the hydrocarbon has a c8 molecule in it which corresponds to the 100 c8 oil in the clever marketing of that competing product
fit perfectly in my ears and i got the best night sleep as i did not have to listening to my husbands loud snoring have not gotten to use the other ear plugs in the set yet but i am sure they are just as great  thumbs up ear joy
you will need to buy a rubber insert or gaskit because it does not fit any scooter post no matter how much you tighten it its too big i had two different scooter brands and birthed fit it without the rubber gasket i bought at a hardware store so your basket twirls and eventually starts to scoot down on your scooter otherwise i love it i cant carry my cell purse tv clicker anything
very strong massage gadget does not replace a great hands on massage but it does what it says it can do knead muscles
couldnt wait to apply this oil to my face and body  my skin felt so smooth like it use to and the itching stopped to  added a dropper to my bath wash it was heavenly showering  added a dropper to my shampoo and for once my scalp wasnt itchy  added a dropper to my body lotion  finally i feel like i can live in my own skin like i use to  it didnt make the eczema go away but it soothed the itching  this oil is a god send
i dont have any kind of beard it is painful to use when i tried to shave my neck it was pulling my hair out rather than cutting
this is not a lifesaving tourniquet it should not be used in a reallife trauma situation the materials and construction are woefully subpar parts of it started to break immediately it looks like many wellknown tourniquets but it is not onpar with the real thingthat said its inexpensive and mimics the cattype ones close enough for training purposes i used it at a class this past weekend and was pleased that i didnt need to put my real medical gear through adverse use conditions a box of these would be fine for something like a stop the bleed course if budget is a concernagain this is not a lifesaving tourniquet training use only
will buy these again and again
though these gauze packs are nonsterile and a bit thin theyre still a decent deal at this price point for backup use emergencies disasters i wouldnt use them in my main first aid kit for my home or car but for my backup kits and emergency bugout bags im okay with taking the chance on nonsterile gauze
i typically drive 1015 hours a day for work i bought this cushion to help with the pains i was experiencing as a result of my work not only did this cushion do nothing to ease my discomfort but it actually increased my discomfort into painbefore using this cushion i took 5 minute stretch breaks every 34 hours and i worked 1215 hours after using the cushion i had to take a stretch break every hour and i could only sit for 810 hours of work a dayseriously i am super disappointed in this cushion if i could give negative stars i would i contacted the company to let them know that i was displeased with this product but they wouldnt refund me now im stuck with this overpriced lintmagnet gel square thats good for nothing
i have been washing dishes a lot since the dishwasher was not doing its job  but  i believe i got the medium size  and they fit good but not tight  i have small hands  and the medium is not tight  and not loose  i can take them off easily and put them on easierwashing dishes is tough for rubber gloves  knives and forks often make holes  and  these gloves are still going for me  i like them  they last long  and no holes after many uses  i have several pairs of these for the bathroom and kitchen  strong gloves  last long
the grapefruit scent is nothing like the description  just smells like cleaner
the cutting head broke where the hinge joins the base
i seem to have a problem with fatigue  i am older and i can be sitting for an hour and start yawning to the point i nearly fall asleep  i can get up and move around a little which does wake me up for a few minutes but if i sit back down the yawning starts again  ive taken these drops for three days now and have not had the yawningsleepy problems like before  not sure if i use up b vitamins more quickly or what but a couple of squirts of this raspberry flavored liquid and im good for several hours  it is a bit sweet but considering im only taking a little and the flavor disappears fairly quickly im okay with it  if you suffer from fatigue these drops may help you too  they sure are working for me
following the directions it was easy to apply and seal up my new granite vanity top was easy
i dont really know how to review a probiotic however i will say i was on antibiotics for a bit and it tore my digestional tract up and these help get my body back on a 34normal schedule34

it was the business lol no but really it was very easy to use and comfortable
i really like these wash cloths whenever my aide does not come to give me a shower i use these and they are wonderful they have a nice smell to them and they warm up nicely
skeptical buyer but went for it after watching you tube videos on how incredibly clean this product transforms your mildewmoldydirty vinyl siding and decking to like new condition we were amazed our ups driver delivered an amazon box to us and we showed him how clean this makes the vinyl siding he couldnt believe it either in fact he took a snapshot of this product and repeatedly thanked us for showing him as he doesnt have the time to climb ladders to clean his house we purchased this products pump sprayer too the sprayer reached the highest pitch approx 25 of our garage so we didnt need to climb a ladder to apply it either amazing product will use every year for certain
good product
this product is okay  the steam is nice but i think i was hoping for more straightening power  i must be used to the flat iron  this is not it  however it does do what it says it will do  maybe my issue was user error
hubby suffers with pain in the back and legs  he has just started using this  according to information we looked into it takes weeks and perhaps months for significant relief but he thinks there has already been some relief the directions are easy to follow  we are looking forward to the increased results with continued use
description says 4pairs but only 4pcs 2pairs in package feel cheatedreturned and found 4pairs with the similar price from other seller

i love what evridwear has done here  3 pouf balls each with a different exfoliating level white light blue moderate dark blue heavy  you get to try each pouf  all and choose your favorite  i love the white pouf my husband likes the dark blue  the variety isnt the only awesome detail  these poufs are very well  made theyre incredibly  strong and durable with  tight bonding that ensures the pouf wont quickly stretch out or fall apart  each does a great job washing exfoliating skin all skin types  and produce a nice lather with soap or body wash  i have terribly dry sensitive skin and these poufs do not irritate or scratch my skin in any way  all 3 are comfortable to use  they even have small rope so the pouf can be hung up when not in use the colors are nice as well  i love the plastic zipper bag the poufs come in  it serves as an excellent storage bag to hold the poufs until theyre used i was seriously shocked at the price for as high quality and well made as these poufs are i would have expected them to cost far more  theres a pouf for everyones preference i just love that evridwear thought to do the 3 different levels what a fantastic idea   evridwear even offers a 60 day quality guarantee your skin is going to look and feel great  thanks to these poufs definitely recommended
i like it but too long squeeze pump inflate  i had injury my neck and spine i feel like support sort of some my neck helps inflate
boring no color to know what youre having and flavor is weak wouldnt recommend
these are basically candy with a small amount of elderberry and vitamin c the dosage of elderberry is quite low and they are pretty much straight sugar they also dont look anything like the picture and are coated in sugar they definitely are delicious but if you want something with a higher amount of elderberry and lower amount of sugar id probably get something else
smells so clean not a strong smell  ill buy more of this i love it
mounted into waterpik base perfectly only quibble is a slow drip where hose goes into handle for a short time after use reviews show its a common complaint
great buy i would recommend seller ant timethanks
finally something that does exactly what youd hoped it would 20 min use after 10 years neglect and all the calluses are gone no more useless pedicures with some tiny girl using an emory board just that just smooths my 1234 thick calluses this thing is easy gentle and amazing
i needed a new small travel jewlery keeper and this works well and fits the stuff i bring on vacation i like the compartments and the quilted zipper case good purchase and the price was good too
this is a great way to boost your immunity add a little into your foods for both health benefits and flavor i love the convenience i usually prefer using fresh foods but when something like red reishi mushrooms are hard to find in my area this is the secondbest way to go
this oil has the classic sandalwood fragrance kind of woody with a powder and incense base noteit seems to be one of those things that you really like it or you dontits a wonderful addition to homemade soaps especially for gentlemen
i will pass this on to my friends and family
worked well to keep my jewelry together while traveling
very pleased seems to me to be the real deal used it for years a long time ago there was a little mix up on my order and they took care of it so i would buy from this source again
the best beard trimmer i have ever owned  long battery life easy to change and control trimmer depth
the selfie stick is easy to use and easy to hold  i love that it has the bluetooth remote  so much easier than setting the timer for selfies it extends to a good length and the tripod is a great bonus  love everything about it
the goodi absolutely loved this thing until it came apartit was easy to install and adjust to my 2004 colorado taking only about 10 minutes with a wrench ratchet and socket sitting at the car door in my wheelchair it could have been done with two pair of pliers though once adjusted it simply lifts out of place when someone else needs to drive the vehicle and is easily returned to position when i am ready to drive againit was only a short learning curve until i was completely comfortable driving with itit was the only left foot gas pedal accessory that i found that didnt have to be bolted to the floorthe badafter only two months the glue that held the plastic base that has the spikes that hold it secure in place by engaging the vehicles carpet completely let go as shown in the pics i would return it but for two reasons i dont want to be without it and i am afraid that the glue on the new one will give out in two more monthsthis is a potentially dangerous problem and you should be watching for it if you already have one or intend to buy oneconclusioni am not saying that you should not buy one but you should be aware of this fatal flaw and be aware that you may have to reglue it furthermore for 300 there should be some thought at the manufacturers level as to how to fix this serious problem
container  stiff pretty fits in car cup holder no lid so after use you just have a tall cylinder with a hole on toptissue rougher than kleenex softer than hospitalhotel tissue works for wiping nose but rough cold or touch up on makeup no also smaller than kleenex comparison in picture so softer prettier hospital tissue also because its rough and stuffed so tight its really difficult to pull only one out i ended up pulling out a lot and tear all of them very frustratingoverpriced for the quality these shouldnt be more than ten in my opinion
at first i loved it because i could breathe more easily but after a while it didnt feel that comfortable  kind of pressed against my nose not painfully but  i was just aware of some pressure  also when i took off the mask i had to find a place to put the shield it  wouldnt stay inside the mask so there were now 2 things to keep track of  im on the fence about this  it does keep the mask cleaner no lipstick stains and it does allow you to breathe but i felt i had to keep adjusting it to try and make it pleasanter to wear  tried it upside down and right side up but it always seemed to press against my nose   it fit nicely inside most masks  both homemade and  disposable ones  i will be so happy when we dont have to wear masks any more  its hard for me to hear at the best of times and the mask straps get caught on my hearing aids and sometimes pull them out of my ears  but i digress
it says its not waterproof but i use this in the shower all the time and it still works great i have seen my acne significantly decrease since using this brush i love love love it and the price is just the icing on the cake
quitting smoking is probably one of the hardest habits to break any help you can get is great this system kind of combines rewards and therapy the sensor helps you track your levels so you get positive reinforcement when you smoke less theres also access to an interactive community to share the journey with others its okay to get help when you need it it doesnt make you weak it makes you smart good luckthanks so much for taking the time to read this review  i hope the information that ive provided helps make your decision a little easier
does the job accordingly
its antifungal and helps itching  crawling
bit big and bulky for smaller people but is sturdy and cushioned
this is one of the nicer sets having had one in the past that was chipped and cracked when brand new and another that literally fell apart after the second usethe stones are nicely polished and rollslide over skin easily so relaxing although if you are looking for this to remove wrinkles prepare to be disappointed puffiness yes wrinklesnoboxed nicely to make for a thoughtful gift
simply did nothing for me
the sponge heads come off almost right away they are not glued to the plastic well at all  you go through 5 heads when you normally would go through one
excellent toner though i didnt recognize that what i am buying is a toner when i add it to my cart i thought it is a facial wash i dont know i just did not concentrate well but im still satisfied the toner is wonderful it gave my skin that fresh glowing clean feeling and look its perfect to wipe your clean face using it before makeup too i didnt breakout afterward the seller sent me  collagen wash gel as a sample and i was impressed with the result too im gonna buy it for sure deserve the 5 stars thank you
absolutely love theseour whole family are doctor who fans but i got these dalek socks for my daughter for back to schoolshe was so thrilled with them in vibrant blue and orange with one pair in a nice grey shade they will work with a variety of outfitsthey hit just over the heel and the socks are soft and comfy my daughter wore them and loved the fit and feel as well as decoration on themany doctor who fan will love emprovided for my opinion and review

i bought to replace a broken chain very good for the price
found ourselves babysitting a mature cat which had to stay in our tiny bedbath combo  no matter how frequently i scooped the litter it was bound to accumulate odors espsmelly cat what are they feeding you remember pheobes song on the tv show friends the litter box was against the wall right in front of where you sit on the toilet  yikes  we keep this deordorizer plugged in  its all but silent but you can hear it circulating the air  im here to tell you i always know when someone has forgotten to plug it back in when theyve used the socket this occupies  it makes a huge difference to our nose  to us that means that its not only working on germs that hit the nose but also those lurking around which we want nothing to do with  germs from potential moldmildew any escaping septic gases germs from morning sneezes and so on if you have a semitighter area where you want to have the air cleaned and smell better this is worth a try it is assuring to know this technology is working for you
this oil has a mild scent to it its what i think of as a classic baby smell i think its lovelyi dont really use baby oil for my skinother than for insect repellant since i dont care for the oiliness it leaves behind but i like to have it around its handy its a main ingredient for many doughssandsslimes which my childrenand myself like to play with the scent of it is relaxing its also great at removing sticky things like gum and stickers and for removing paint from brushes and hands
this thing is amazing i dont know what i was doing with my life before it came along i use it for my shoulders and my neck mostly but it also wraps around my waist and doubles as periodpain relief when needed

the parts fit together well but the squeegee is too flimsy and too narrow if you put even a bit too much pressure it is almost to the metal  squeegee doesnt work very well  not worth the hassle of returning but wouldnt buy again or recommendalthough you can take it apart to make it shorter a full telescoping of all parts would be more convenient also
if you want to buy the best carlons has been in the fish oil business ages before the fad began

no product can work perfectly for everyone but this has been great for me i have always carried my tension in my neck and shoulders and then i hurt my neck about three years ago snce then ive woken up with a crick in my neck that wont go away for a week or two about once every 4 to 6 weeks sometimes more often sometimes it even happens if i just move the wrong way  throughout the dayi began to use this device about a week ago and it loosened my neck right up in about two days im trying to get in the habit of using it almost every night for 10 to 15 minutes before i go to sleep and my neck feels freer more relaxed and more mobile than it has felt in a few years

i have the month disposable contacts but i am meticulous about cleaning them  i feel by using this at least once a week along with regular multipurpose solutions in my storage case i can at the very least double the time i wear my lens before disposal  there is no material difference between regular lenses and those that are disposable its just the kind of care you give them

very heavy and thick thank you bags they have crisp clean folds and a reinforced bottom im confused as to why the handles arent put in for you the handles are almost like a grosgrain ribbon they have plastic at the tip youll need to push the tip thru both holes then cross your fingers that they hold up after something heavy is in bag though it seems like plastic tip is enough for them not to slip thru
bristles are not sturdy enough to brush teeth and the bamboo feels like its going to give me a splinter waste of money
these are the very best love the packaging too but way too overpriced on amazon these are whole foods brand and cost a 3rd in store of what is priced here

received my first container on time however im still trying to pick my jaw off the floor after opening it only to find less than a container of powder  i included some images along with a tape measure to show the depth of the plastic containerthe contents is a very fine powder that looks thinner than cacao powder if that helps understand the consistencyit has a sweet yet bitterly aroma to itsince mine is missing the scoop i used a teaspoon full into my evening coffeethe taste is not overwhelming in my coffee as im using unpasteurized honey to sweeten my beveragei have taken capsules of lions mane the past few months  however due to a quicker delivery system the powder is supposed to have im trying thismaybe my container was  at the end of the line getting a fill upi will update my review asa i can feel the effects of the powder verses capsules

i love this kit it comes with a wide variety of file textures it works great on bare nails and on acrylics i had never used glass files before and they worked great  much better than i expected they are also attractive which is never a bad thing grin  i recommend this kit very nicely put together and everything you need for trimming and filing a variety of nail types

love the size it can be crammed to the gills with everything a home medical kit could need its great to have for traveling in it i have pain and fever reducers aspirin acetaminophen naproxen  sodium allergy relief gloves masks scissors band aids wound patches laxative pills gauze rolls cough and cold syrups peroxide antibiotics antibiotic ointment antiitch cream boil ointment petroleum jelly rubbing alcohol cotton balls antibacterial hand soap hand sanitizers i think that covers everything and there is still a little more room for more soft type products so even though when you get it it might look small once you fill it up it makes a super portable and travel ready kit the price is right and it is made very nice recommended
kinesio tape is great for many physical body scenarios  i have tried other brands which are not as effective as the kinesio tex gold brand it is very adhesive and generally lasts at least three days you can shower with it on swim sweat etc it is also easy to take off and little adhesive is left on your skin i learned how to apply the tape for my injury from my physical therapist i recommend talking to them before applying on yourself

this is very moisturizing and protective with hardly any scent  which is perfect for me will buy again as needed
when i first got this i expected it to be brown like other products from these sourceshow this comesthis comes in a large plastic bottle  there is a seal on top that needs to be removedwhat is this likeinstead of brown like other products made from these sources this is clear  there is no flavor or scent  shaking it up does not seem to change thatflavorno flavorhow to takei take a teaspoon of this once a day in the morning in a small cup of waterdoes it do anythingi seem to see a bit of support in energy sleep and overall  i am taking this in the dead of winter where it has been near zero for almost a month straight  i am usually dragging and very tired and worn during this period  i have been taking this along with a few supplements and i am doing remarkably wellthe bottom linethis supplement seems to be supportive through a very difficult cold and dry winter  i am usually tired but taking this i am notmy ratingfive stars  this seems to be working for me  i am not sure why there is no flavor or color but it is helping somewhat so i will finish the bottle
i bought this directly from the manufacturer i must say for the price it was not at all worth it yes it is a cushion but it is a 60 cushion 34best in the world34  no my cushion moves around on my chair all day long and i usually find myself doing the 34one cheek lean34 my computer chair is already cushioned so i went with this cheaper thinner version if i had paid 100 for this boy would i be disappointed by the end of the day there really is no difference i feel like ive turned or re positioned as many times as i normally would at first i felt like i would need to get used to the new cushion but after 34 weeks or so it is still uncomfortable the company reached out to me for my review i gave the same review i did here but have not heard back return policy is meh funny because i live in utah and they are manufactured here in utah
good saw results in about a week
they can be used vertically or horizontally great for christmas cards

i used this straightner for my 5 year old hair she has been suffering from lice for about a month now i heard heat killed them however she has beautiful wavy hair and i did not want to damage it this product is both gentle and effective the brush combined with the heat gives a smooth look i used this combined with a lice comb and i got rid of alot of them i would not recommend to replace your hair straighter i would use it after straightening to create a soft look
perfect fragrance for my kitchen  quality product that lasts and does not clog my diffuser
with the fastening at the front this wrap is uncomfortable its difficult to line up the velcro so perfectly that you dont get scratchedbut with the wrap at the back its fine works very well for what i wanted its soft and seems to be a nice quality
this doesnt foam up and works well for cleaning carpets  i like that there are no harsh chemicals but more soim glad it cleans  it did a great job on my carpets and i will begin trying it on more things as well

i have taken 2 pills in one day and felt no energy or boost i will continue to take since i purchased them however i hope when it is in my system it will do more than this first day
good protection
lid can half broken then completely disconnected within a week  didnt talk to seller  thought it would be better quality
good product works
my joints are slightly better with this supplement
i did not try these yet but so far i am impressed with the producti actually bought them for my mother in law for christmas she likes her air fresheners so i thought she would like this as a gift plus they will probably save her money and reduce wastethey are prettier than the plastic ones bigger than expected and they also seem durable and heavyi will update after she uses them but i really think she will like these
great pre and post workout mix yes it has aspartane but then again the last thing i want in my diet is more sugar i thought the taste was a little sweet so i did dilute this more than the recommended mixture you will probably need to do the same depending on your taste high in electrolytes and protein this is great for my florida workouts with the heat and humidity and i lose more water sweating than in probably any other area of the country i was previously a gatorade drinker but i honestly prefer this science in sport and will be buying more
these work great  im allergic to many of the dryer sheets and these dont cause me any problems
very nice and comfortable mask
easy to use easy to remove and adhesion  removal of pet hair
these are ok didnt provide a ton of warmth but are comfortable
as a husband who recently picked up the heated sleep eye mask by carefor for my wife i am happy to say that she absolutely loves it this eye mask has been a gamechanger for her nighttime routine as it quickly heats up and stays warm for a long time providing her with the perfect amount of relaxation and comfortone of the things that stands out about this eye mask is its 3d ergonomic design it perfectly contours to her face blocking out all light and allowing her to completely relax the graphene material used in the mask is topquality ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed and that she remains comfortable throughout the nightthe magnet suction wire is also a great feature as it keeps the mask securely in place without any discomfort or slipping my wife also loves how breathable and soft the mask is which helps prevent any irritation or sweating around the eyesoverall the heated sleep eye mask by carefor is a musthave for anyone who struggles with migraines dry eyes or just wants a more relaxing and comfortable sleep its also perfect for nap time or travel making it a versatile and useful addition to any routine highly recommended
ive never used anything like this before so my dissatisfaction may simply be user error ill try it again and update if i get it to work well but they say to only use it twice a week for no more than 5 minutes so it may take weeks to figure out what works i got this when i had a blackhead thats not on my face only to learn that this is only supposed to be used on the face on skin that is not thin so i decided to try it on my nose and around my mouth where it tends to get greasy and clogged though my skin was left red with increased circulation i didnt see any pus in the chamberthere are five suction heads to choose from and the directions detail why you would choose one over the other they also describe how to use the different heads most effectively the heads are easy to snap on and pull off they included several sponges that you put between the section head and the vacuum to catch any pus and these sponges are washable and reusable to clean after use you remove the head and the sponge and clean themi got a washcloth steaming with hot water and held it over my chin to nose like they suggested to help enlarged pores i then dried off the area as they dont want any water suctioned into the machine and immediately started using the machine on the preset vacuum level i thought it was level 3 but it turns out it was only level 2 out of 5 still this seem pretty strong to me you run the vacuum head over the area lift and repeat for 1 to 2 minutes the head also has tiny led red and blue lights that shine at your face while youre doing thisyou longpress the power button to turn the power on and off but shortpress it to change between blackhead vacuum mode cold compress mode and hot compress mode there is also a button to change the vacuum speed the cold compress reaches its coolest temperature 20c68f very quickly and youre supposed to use this on an area that has just been vacuumed to help close the pores i feels pleasantly cool the hot compress is supposed to reach a temperature between 38c and 42c or 1004f to 1076f it got up to 31c then started dropping then it turned off automatically this was not warm enough to do anything but feel pleasantly warm i dont see how it could help open pores when hot steam didnt noticeably work
the best part of this sound machine is that an alexatype voice speaks to you as you set the timer 15 minutes press button 30 minutes 60 minutes etc it has a soft foreign accent that i cant place but its cute most sound machines dont have a human voice saying anything i guess its needed because there are no light buttons to tell you which setting youre choosingexcept for this i felt this device feels cheaply made the casing feels cheap hard brittle plastic and the buttons on the interface are not sensitive to touch you have to press really hard sometimes to get it to change settings the volume control is also confusing  there are actually two volume controls  one to raise the volume one to lower i was pressing one volume control the loud one thinking that i could lower it but i was mistaken  you have to press the low volume buttonon the positive side the night light works well  the colors are neon bright and you can keep a steady color going all night long or cycle through the different colors the timer like i said has a human voice which is kind of cool the weak parts are the button responsiveness and some of the sounds the lullaby function is good and the sound is sharp and clear the nature sounds are relatively good  the best are the chirping bird sounds and thunderstorm but the water sounds ie ocean babbling brook sound muffled and are not particularly sharp the white noise is also kind of indistinct and the fetal heartbeat sound is just plain crude  not so much a heartbeat but like someone else noted its like banging drumssoits a serviceable device but i would not pay too much for this there are so many better ones out there
i ordered this shaver for my husband to try and weve had nothing but problems with it it wasnt charged at all upon receiving it it was completely dead  we put it on the charger for several hours as the manual recommended and it workedwhile charging there is a red light next to where the cable plugs in and the light stays lit all the time  even after the shaver is charged so you never knew if the battery if fully charged and whether or not it will overheatthe shaver manual is not much help and in fact makes this product more confusing the printed manual and writing on the shaver box have conflicting charging instructions the manual says to charge up to 8 hours and advises no longer  the box says 1 hour for 60 minutes of shaving this is kind of confusing because my husband was never able to get 60 minutes of use after charging  he was only able to get 2 shaves each at about 7 minutes before the battery went dead and had to be rechargedso my husband will not be using this shaver since the battery keeps going dead and the rotary blades are weakening from pressing the shaver against his face  this shaver is a nogo
as a true nerd i really enjoy the packaging that looks like a beaker it gives you the instant impression that whats inside is very effective the toner addresses several issues with one easy treatment it calms irritation balances oil production smoothes texture and brightens skin tone it kind of straddles the line between toner and essence because it also moisturizes its ideal for oily and acneprone skin use twice daily for maximum effects i highly recommend itthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
the small roller handle came apart withing 2 seconds and wouldnt stay put  the larger roller handle is very thin and will bend when using it  i was gentle with the rollers but these are no good  returning
poor construction  i have 3 other grabbers different makes and this is the first one i shall call crapnot sturdy  the  fold in center of length  does not hold well  lets it weave  wobble  too much trouble to returngrabbers are required in my life since spinal  fusion from t4 neck  to pelvis
item was opened and looks to have had something stuck in there will not use waste of money
i think this is a very good d3k2 supplement it seems to be very reasonably priced as of this review a bottle of 60 veggie caps costs 1619 giving you a 3 month supply one capsule delivers 125 mcg of d3 and 100 mcg  of vitamin k2 210 mg calcium is also included which is only 16 dv i take at least 5000 iu of d3 each day and usually more since it is such a powerful antiviral and is so good for brain health and in combination with k2 needed calcium is stored in bones and being 63 i dont want to get soft or brittle bones as i age i think this is a very good supplement
you know i didnt expect miracles but this is way better than the big orange things i used to get at walgreens  i wore them to see flaming lips at bill graham in sf on halloween  at first i though they didnt do much but my ears were not ringing after the show so they must have done something  my major complaint theyre hard to hold onto which means theyre easy to drop and lose forever in a crowded show  the canister is nice
no good sharpness
been using a berger lamp since 1989 and love them beautiful scents beautiful containers lampes
bought this for my grandpa for fathers day and he wont stop talking about how much he loves it  we tested it out before delivering it to him just so we were familiar with how it works in case he calls us with questions laterwe were surprised that it came full charged we thought it was pretty cool that the led on the front actually displays how much power is left in our case is clearly said 100the bag it comes in is convenient and nice but i doubt hell need it much since my grandpas dexterity is limited we appreciated how easy it is to plug in to charge  we also appreciate that it comes with another set of bladesill be happy to update how well it holds up after my grandpa abuses this one over next three months
study perfect for any first aid kit

perfect for putting brother tze tapes in
these masks are comfortable to wear the material is soft and slightly stretchy these do not have filter pockets nose bridge wires or adjustable ear straps i like the polka dot prints
oddly stevia is not listed as one of the ingredients the ingredients listed are maltodextrin and silica  thats it the product is sweet however and performs as i expected other on products i have used contained the full list of ingredientsthis must be a labeling error
this is exactly what i was looking for  easy to use right out of the box comfortable to hold
best product for stage ii pressure ulcers and moisture related skin breakdown incontinence related dermatitis wouldnt use as a barrier on intact skin ad or zn based product better if skin intact as a wound certified nurse this is one of my favorite treatmentsbecause it works this particular product is the medline version of lantiseptic
the extended length of this shoe horn alleviated back pain my mother was experiencing  using a shorter handled shoe horn  great length for anyone with back issues or inability to be as flexible as they used to be
this is a super compact little light that i about blinded myself with when i was learning to use the controls lol i absolutely love the size of this it can fit on even the smallest most cluttered of desks as it is just a flat screen with a removablerepositionable kickstand nice long cord easy to understand and control the light temperatures were one of the selling points for me as i despise white light and this does not disappoint its warm light is perfect and has different brightness levels the timer is also quite nice i will be ordering at least 1 more for my adult son well worth the price having this in front of me id pay much more
i have an old paint gun and these are getting hard to find

fit my z2 travel cpap perfectly  admittedly i was using it in a more tropical climate so i cant attest to how well it works in a drier area but it seemed to help with dryness that ive experienced without it
wet charcoal goes everywhere so beware and it takes a lot to get it out of your teeth and gums even after brushing with toothpaste i had to floss twice have only used once so no results yet but so far im not impressed

reliable over the years long lasting wash cloth of choice 4 stars
helps with inflammation
the denture bath is nice but its too small
presently the best on the market but get the pro formula as it does the job as i have tried them all
product is exactly as described
these are a perfect fit for the scotchbrite dish scrubber and they work much better than the name brand refills the quality of the materials seems better the green scrubbing sponge seems thicker and more durable and they dont appear to sit and leak soap everywhere like the scotchbrite heads do i will buy again
fantastic sponge durable and great feel to it the band help keeps your hand in place
its really small and hard to apply i have calluses from crossfit plus my hands rip now and then this is no different than rubbing coconut oil on your hands
great buy
i liked that theyre transparent so i can see just how much water is in them they dont leak and retain heat pretty well would buy again but they seem well made and i dont expect to have to
so i have these flats that are just a little too big my heels always come out everytime i take a step i put the black pads on first and my heel came out as soon as i took my first step but then didnt the rest of the time i walked they still felt a little loose so i doubled up and this time i put the nude one on over the black incase youd see a gap and i tell you what they fit perfectly now i gave 4 stars because i feel if they were a little thicker theyd be perfect its a great deal and im so happy i came across these i definitely recommend them
this product works pretty good for upper shoulder muscle issues and it has a nice menthol smell that reminds me of vicks  this is a cream that absorbs well into the skin but i do have to use quite a bit so do not expect it to last very long  having said this it is priced more reasonably than some of the other pain creams out there and in addition to the topical analgesic also has ingredients such as aloe arnica boswelia bromelain and msm  all of these other ingredients have antiinflammatory properties so overall this product has a good combination of ingredients to combat muscle pain
cute lightweight fits well
i bought these for a baby shower gift  they are excellent quality and look exactly like the picture
wonderfully odoriferous good value timely shipping
i love this product totally recommend to anyone will purchase again
ive tried different electric toothbrushes over the years it is particularly nice to have one that is so easily portable  this works almost as well as my sonicare brush but the added convenience that comes with its size and being able to take it with me is much appreciatedthe toothbrush pulses at 30 second intervals and shuts off in 2 minutes  the toothbrush has 5 different modes and 3 strength options so the brush adjusts to the strength and power that you need
i am very happy with my purchase of these hot socks my feet get cold very easily in the air conditioning   im not a happy camper with cold feet at all i have used these during the day while on the computer   just love using them at night going to bed you just pop them in microwave slip them on those cold toes   feet oh my what a warm fuzzy feeling i cant wait till winter my feet will be very happy this year after playing in the snow i like to apply  lavender or roman chamomile essential oils to my feet also with castor oil cover your feet with a plastic bag  then put these socks on it does double duty for warmsoft  smooth feet  a better nights sleep i received this product at a discount or for free for giving a review

i suffer from consistently low levels of vitamin b12 due to a pancreatic issue that i have  i already get monthly shots but my levels remain low so i decided to get this liquid version for a quick pick me up outside of my daily vitamins  i will admit that i noticed a bit of a pick me up from these when added to my diet  the raspberry flavor is pretty strong but i always follow it with a drink of something else that has a strong flavor and its fine  im very happy with this supplement though and will be picking these up again when i run out
works great
almost the same well buy more
this toothpaste worked great leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean and not too dry i tend to have dry mouth as for the ingredients they are vegan friendly and the materials used in the container are ocean safe and recyclable bonus made in the usa good toothpaste
seems to work great have only had it a month now so i will see how it endures
these taste horrible  they have an oragano flavor that is just gross in a gummy  they are cubed shaped as well so swallowing them whole is a chore  im sure they work well enough but i just could not get past the flavor  maybe i got a bad batch or something but too gross for my tastes
as advertised
first i purchased these directly from the manufacturer  thus it doesnt say 34verified34 purchase for me  i went to the manufacturer because i wanted to try a smaller set 1 month set which was not offered on amazon when i purchased it1  a 34one month supply34 is really only a one week supply  the 34effects34 are supposed to last one month  misleading to say the least  should say its a one week supply2  i took pictures that show no difference to my eye  note  i used exactly as described on instructions  also my front top 4 teeth are 15 year old porcelain overlays  supposedly this system is safe and effective on dental work as well as natural teeth  i didnt see it3  it is messy and a two step process tube  1 is the a super stain treater and then tube 2 which you apply after using tube 1  the pic i have included was after tube 2  note  the tubes themselves were a serious pain most of the time they were extremely difficult to get open even with 34careful bending34 per instruction  i think i had one tube that actually opened without considerable force which causes the swab to be displaced making it more difficult to apply the treatment  they also include a tube that you are to use while you are out and about and have eaten or had something to drink that could be potentially staining  it has a soft brush like tip4 initially the solution didnt really effect me one way or the other however by the end of the 7 days my gums were very sensitive  i have a sonic toothbrush with an all purpose name brand toothpaste and brushed my teeth prior to each treatment which i chose to do in the mornings5  it is obviously a peroxide formula of some sort  you can taste it  with a bit of mint or something mixed in but there is no hiding the peroxide flavor6 in the end photos dont lie  i dont see any improvement at all  photo number 1 is before feb 17 photo number 2 is feb 23  the rest were photos i would like to see if i were considering a purchase  hope it helpsin my opinion these are a waste of time and money i included the photos so you could make your own decision  i never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful but honestly i will not be buying these again either from the manufacturer or from amazon
while i didnt get much from it the wife loves this product
this leather cleaner works very well both for shoes and for leather bags  i tried it on a small spot before using it on the full bag it was easy to apply as i can control the amount of cleaner it just requires even application and careful rubbing and it moistens and revitalizes leather
magnesium is an essential supplement for women  it makes a noticeable difference in my everyday life in many areas from lessening anxiety to keeping me regular  im happy with this purchase because its a good deal for a quality product  thank you
id have to say its the first time ive reviewed a product works as advertised but still only gets 1 star the manufacturer doesnt try to hide the fact that it will keep your bong cleaner but not clean honesty is refreshinghowever i have a triple honeycomb disk ice bong and rezblock seems to create a film of its own above the uppermost disk where it only receives liquid during a hit when not being hit for a while that section sits and dries leaving a pink tinge to the resin buildup in that area being that its an ice bong i cant access that area from above to clean it separately to be honest its pricey considering i still have to break out the rezcaps pickling salt and isopropyl every three days anywayno one shows off a new state of the art bong thats nearly clean
i love sweetsation therapy products and this one is no exception usually i order directly from their site but this go it was cheaper on amazon go figure i purchased this after trying the honest brand sunscreen which i bought from costco that was 34honestly34 the worst sunscreen i have ever purchased it was so greasy and oily and never absorbed in their skin they were walking oil slicks for the day and even with it slathered on they still got sunburned not good needless to say i returned that product and do not recommend it at all horrible so in my quest to find a new sunscreen i decided to bite the price bullet and purchase this sunscreen from sweetsation therapy i am sooo happy i did it is a wonderful sunscreen not greasy or oily at all more like a cream that goes on and absorbs wonderfully it also is great at protecting them from the sun especially now that summer has arrived no burns yet very happy with this purchase i will be buying again oh and it doesnt cause any allergy issues with either children especially my daughter who has very sensitiveallergyhive prone skin issues and it smells like chocolate how can you beat that a little bit goes a long way so the heftier price tag is worth the money in my opinion
great little roller balls and i love the color
sorry but not the best cleaner leaves mat with a film that i cant get rid of without running a hose on my mat or putting it in the shower does not work as advertised seems to be a little t of false advertising these days on amazon
i love how they feel and help my persistent dry and splitting heels however im reacting with a rash to the silicone against my skin so ive turned the socks inside out to wear them and put my regular sock over the top so i can slip into my shoes easier and keep my feet warm in these winter months
i like the taste of this one i like the clove and mint taste and it really cleans your teeth well
this was an unexpected little surprise  i will admit upfront i purchased this free to review iti do not end up purchasing everything i am offered i do not believe in purchasing things or taking things i will not use  this however was intriguing to me  i have long hair that is past my waist and i already use hair straighteners and curling wands  i am 43 and with long hair one must be careful to not fall into the category of having old lady hair that should not be long  i love my hair and love good hair styling products and hair products in generalthe brush registers in celsius but the instructions tell you what settings to use so getting past the learning curve it is easy  the thing can get hot  and i would not just set it on the counter  the back of it gets very hot even when it is cooling downa con is where the buttons are located  when i am using it i keep turning it either off or hotter or cooler  the buttons are in a very very bad spoti have used this on slightly damp hair and dry hair and i say it works best on slightly damp hair  small sections also work the besti have not had any problems with melting plastic or anything  no weird smells  no hair burningdoes it make my hair straighter  actually  yes  and softer too  that was the pleasantly surprised part  do i like this better than my name brand hair straightener  i dont know  i think i like them both differently  i think this straightener is faster  i think my name brand straightener makes for smoother hair  i guess i am also afraid of damaging my hair and since this is made out of country i do not know much about the ceramics used and so i am very conservative and cautious when i use thisi have attached a picture of before and after use  this was damp just showered hairoverall a good purchase  i plan on using it often
no relief from pain this local medication
i love these pads i purchased two packs one for my beauty needs and one for my dogs i have a boxer and apply an antifungal ointment to clean his wrinkly face daily these are perfect for both our needs i wash them in a small garmentlingerie bag and air dry them these make great gifts
these are great qtip swabs my toddler really disliked getting his ears cleaned but these make it a much more tolerable experience hes even wanting to do it himself now and i can let him knowing its safe he cant push it in too far
this is an absolute perfect gift to give my 19 year old grand daughter she just loves everything that is bling and sparkly this si a great size of 7 inches long and will fit perfectly in her purse there will be no more waiting on her to do her hair because now she can do it in the car on the way since it has a car plug in it is great that this is dual voltage as it will allow her to travel in the military it is very light weight and comes with its own carrying bag it heats up fast and works great on my trial run with it before i give it to her
i was very surprised how amazing of a job this product does  i have tried it on the dirtiest of pipes and some very hard to clean pieces and had great success with any attempt instructions were easy to follow and even a friends pipe that hadnt been cleaned since he got many moons ago was able to come clean with the recommended time didnt even have to sit for hours like recommended for dirty pipes ive also found no residual flavor after a simple wash out this product is very well worth the purchase and now im a lifelong customer
i bought for work to check pull forces on material handling equipment  works just as well as the professional ones that cost 1000  you cant calibrate it but it gets close enough for what i need it for  excellent purchase
love this stuff
i got this for my daughter whos almost four years old we cant find any bigger swim diapers anywhere for her and im so glad i found this shes not potty trained due to disability and im glad theres something out there for someone like her so shes able to keep swimming practice since the pool doesnt allow those disposable ones anymore id imagine that there would be many out there who could use these big swim diapers too i like the basic colors we can pretty much use this on her with any cute swimsuits over it cant even tell that this is underneath her swimsuit thank you pool pal
very nice and workable bottles for making oil blends i love the cobalt blue also
the tool itself is great but its almost useless bc it wont stay on the floor the suction cups come off easily its a shame bc it could be brilliant
i had a good buying experience items are what they say only 3  because they unfortunately do not work for my hubs maybe its just him  not the products  theres a chance it may work for some  not others for the price it certainly doesnt hurt to try
the cloth liner didnt even make it through one house cleaning
these are so easy to open and close and stay closed too  they are so cute and convenient for carrying pills in my purse  i couldnt ask for a better product  price is great too
this lotion is a must have in my house i have insane foot and calve cramps that wake me up out of deep sleep i rub some of this on and within a minute they calm down and i can fall back to sleep sometimes i just out it in my feet before bed because it relaxes me and helps me get a good nights sleep there is no smell its not overly greasy or sticky i love this stuff and have recommended it to multiple people who now also swear by it its something i dont mind spending money on because its a necessity
this set of toothbrushes is terrific especially for those with sensitive gums and teeth the brushes are soft and almost sponge like they are effective at cleaning teeth without causing irritation they are comfortable to hold and use the cylindrical plastic cases make them ideal for travel one of the caps is perforated to let moisture out the four different colors help family members easily identify theirs very impressed
love the fit and style
one broke after about two weeks i will see how the next one lasts
followed directions and takes some time so hoping it worked not easy to know if it works for money but will try not sure i would buy another unless i feel it does help to seal my granite from smelling
i like the toothpaste no fluoride it cleans and whitens however it has sodium benzoate
this product is great especially for the price  its easy to use and my baby girl doesnt mind it at all
i cooked two of the eight burger patties i got off amazon magic truck yesterday  little shrinkage and great taste  happy
cute militarydressed dog matches gave away with candles during the holidays  i like them price was too high though i purchased on a whim  none of those who received them as gifts mentioned how adorable they were guess ill have to choose my friends better in the future
what an endearing book its as pleasant as drinking tea in the garden and kitchen with a good friend this book is helpful practical and fun i would recommend it to anyone even though i have quite a few herb books this was was a good addition it has a clean feeling to it simple and nice
this toilet spray does do a good job of killing odors and is quick and easy to use the scent however is just ok granted pretty much any scent is better than the scent this is meant to cover up but the sea salt scent is more floral than i was expecting its an ok scent but not 100 to my liking the other issue ive had is that the sprayer doesnt always spray properly instead of a mist it sort of splatters the liquid at times making a bit of a mess unless your aim is perfectly true its only happening with one of the containers so it seems that the sprayer is defective given the price point better quality sprayers should have been usedthe scent plus the sprayer issue lowers my score to 4 stars but its otherwise a decent product that does what it says it will do
i buy these because i like that i could just dispose and they are not plastic or styrofoam but they are expensive
these keto electrolyte drops have helped me to get back on the track to losing weight they dont taste the best in the world but they dont taste horrible either they are better taken in something to drink the bottle is good sized for the price you pay the keto salt isnt strong tasting which to me is a good thing because i cant hardly stomach that taste these work good and are a great value
works and you do not get sick on thisonly it is a little too much moneybut if you need it  go for it
i was so happy to see something pretty for an 80 year old birthday party  these were reasonably priced very soft and quick shipping  definitely use them again
i have slouched my whole life and have always had bad posture after having this product for only a week i am standing up straighter and people are commenting that i look better and healthierjust from standing up straight it comes with instructions that are easy to follow and i only keep it on for about 30 min to an hour a day while i do household chores such a game changer
the fit works very snug not as much force its a slight notice of power as the brand name replacement heads but just as good for the price
it works fine
tastes great i used it in smoothies frozen fruit milk and ice and it mixes really well not sure it would mix well if you are just trying to use a liquid definitely better to blend it in a blender ive had this container for months and still have half of it left and its just as fresh as ever the price is a little high but it does seem to last a while
couldnt sit in at office chair all day without it so comfortable i could sit on it 247
oh my gosh this is so comfortable  my back is so happythank you
almost makes tie shoes into slipons

good for getting accurate circumference measures on yourself and others the plastic portion on the end of the tape keeps the tape from retracting into the container and being lost forever this portion of the tape needs to be reinforced as the tape is useless once it breaks
this are huge i tie a know on one corner and they dont fall out when the trash is taken you can reuse them until they get really dirty and smelly
ive used this for years now it gives me the feeling that my back feels better not sure how it works but i use it on my back
excellent product for neck pain
high quality capsules
these little bags are the perfect size for portion control they work great
for the past couple of years ive hardly been sick at all i take my vitamin c daily and i think that helps but recently i was around someone who was coughing and touching everything and spreading their cold everywhere it was very frustrating to realize that i was probably going to get sickwell i had one day of feeling like i was getting a cold and i took this four times a day as prescribed wow im not sick this stuff really must work i found the taste inconsequential in a glass of water i could not taste it at all one dropper full in water is the recommended dose it is about 25 drops of liquid i counted it to be surebuying this may seem expensive but how much is your health worth to me it was well worth the cost and this bottle will last a long time as you use so little when they say you will be well in a day they really mean iti was very impressed with this remedy and will keep it on hand at all times it works better than anything ive tried before i even told my nurse practitioner about it and she thought it was goodwho wants to be sick for a week or more i just dont have the time as with all herbal remedies do consult with your doctor before takingthe rebecca review
these are classic ziploc gallon size bags with a nice slider closing they are durable  hold a lot a great find on amazon for a loved ones favorite nfl team fabulous price to pay for an unexpected special gift to receive in the mail i definitely recommend
expensive but excellent product  if you can afford it buy it
i bought this hoping to increase my fiber intake to help regulate me  it turns out its only soluble fiber which didnt do anything for my purposes  the product itself is easy to take  it dissolves fully after a minute or two and is completely taste and texture less  its easy to take but it wasnt any use to me
it really does pull the gunk out of your pores
these are very convenient the box looks nice enough that i can put them on a side table
these do what they say they do they are very easy to swallow i have had no problems with them
i personally do not like this product it contains caffeine i took two pills and i could not sleep for an entire nightthe concentration of vitamin b12 is too high it doesnt make any sense to take all that vitamin b12 every day your body will discard the rest with urine and you will have a peak of vitamin b12 in the blood despite b12 does not induce cytotoxicity why wasting money in something you dont needadditionally they put in optimind lgaba to compensate the effect of caffeine so why putting caffeine in the first placethis is an extremely expensive itemplease be careful because they are very sneaky if you cancel the free trial subscription period on line on their website in fact you click cancer and you see a message you are almost done however you have to wait a few secondsminutes to display the final please cancer now only then you will receive an email confirming your cancellation this is a very sneaky way to induce people to forget to wait and continue with cancellation and charge them with an additional chargealpha brain is for example a superior product more cost efficient and with no caffeine if people want caffeine they can drink a coffee
these aminos taste so damn good ive bought these twice now and i dont know if im placeboing myself to death but i could swear that im recovering much faster since i started taking them ive always had a few workouts that have left me sore and spent for the next 2 or so days and that has stopped just had to take almost 3 weeks off from the gym and i came back with no soreness inspite of an intense workoutthe only issue i have is with the packaging the bag is way too big and the scoop way too short for the amount you get you have to stick your hand completely in the bag to get anything out my knuckles always come out covered a shorter bag or a small plastic container is really needed bag also reads about 40 servings i got closer to 30 by using the included scoopedit i asked rem one of the company owners about the packaging and he said theyre going to make the switch to smaller tub containers so no more dusty knuckles he responded almost immediately a customer service
love this stuff it has alot of health benifits and i dont have and issue with the taste of vinegar but my daughter also uses it  and she likes the taste too it took her about a week and now she even puts it in her water and like the taste the best part is it is natural
great replacement for my favorite running shoes
these are pretty sturdy can be washed and reused easily  they dry quickly they are too thin to be washed in a washing machine i plan on using about a sheet a week to clean my kitchen counters these are way better than using a towel or sanitizing wipes as these are biodegradable and better for the earthi ordered these in two colors magenta and fuchsia they are basically the same color and the color dosent bleed off the fabric
these cup are just odd the gold rim looks cheap and it they break easily i dont like them and i wouldnt use them anywhere
i have a pair of duck boots and i have a few pairs of tennis shoes that have developed a smell that is somewhat gross  i sprayed them with10seconds disinfectantdeodorizer and the smell has either been reduced to a minimum or removed  i have applied this product at different intervals depending on how often i wear the pair of shoes  it does a good job
perfect just as described
i wanted a nice looking set of clippers but also needed them to be functional i also wanted both a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper in one set the clippers arrived quickly and when i got the set home i wanted to try them out right away they came together in a set in a small cardboard box there isnt a carrying case but i will just slip them into a small makeup bag for storagethese clippers felt solid and balanced in my hand but were easy to cut with the clippers are easy to grip because they are ergonomically correct and they cut smoothly every time they cut through the nail very cleanly with no jagged edges or pulling too these clippers open wide enough to cut well for im sure even thick nailsand are curved on the ends for an even cut i had absolutely no problems in using these clippers the clippers are made of strong stainless steel that allows me to sanitize them without worry of rust or corrosion they should last a lifetime i received the product for testing purposes i have no complaints or problems and the product ive tried is working very well for me this is my personal opinion and i am in no way required to write a review i will leave honest feedback that i base on my own personal experience with the product i receive i am in no way affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods
yeah i know  strange thing to purchase and talk about  heres the scoop  we are owner operators and so we own our own trucking company  every once in a blue moon i go with hubs in his truck  i also have a baby bladder  i inevitable have to urinate when i should be sleeping at night  who wants to get out of the truck and go into a truck stop or otherwise in the middle of the night  dont want to have to wake hubs to take me  also  the current health situation in our country  who wants to use public restroomsthis one is cumbersome it ends up leaking too much tubing the gasket thingie falls off i dont loke this at all
easy to make and great tasting
not sure after using it only one time so far
it does not work for gymnastics activities  34it stays34 seems to work better
the texture is just right not too much hard beeswax or too much soft olive oilthe price is reasonable compared with the big name brandthe taste of olive oil is ok  id rather have that than petrochemicals on my lipsim not happy that the useby date is only 2 months after the date my order cameso all the unused tubes will have to be stored in the refrigerator or freezer door until needed
not enough iron to keep up with anemia even taking double during the one week a month
these are pretty good for general noise cancelling  mowing the lawn sporting events etc but i wouldnt recommend them for shooting none of them felt like they protected my hearing as well as my over the ear protectors do
i used this only once since it arrived yesterday but i was really pleased  it is very lightweight which surprised me and when i was finished brushing my teeth my teeth were actually so clean they were shiny  it is much more comfortable for me than my former electronic toothbrush since it is smaller and reached all of my back teeth  and just for fun i loved that i bought the pink one
a nice fiber pickmeup for no guilt snacks andor light meal replacement they taste healthy not real sweet but pleasant
i dont mind taking these they taste good and easy to get your fiber
fast and accurate
the order came on time undamaged and i am pleased i ordered this producti never thought being to acidic would cause many health issuesnow i can keep myself in check dailyor whenever i wanti plan to order from this company for giving this product as xmas gifts to people in my circle
ok so i never know if the natural stuff works as i have no patience and end up taking tylenol as well to suppress symptomsanyway this past week i caught a pretty bad cold sneezing runny nose etc i took this for 23 days  sudafed pe to suppress symptoms and in 2 days i felt human again my colds usually last minimum a week to 10 daysi also took olive leaf for my throat and i think that took care of thatno natural remedy ever worked on me  i think this is a winner so far  pricey yes but have been uing it already for months i think it stopped a cold at the very beginning a few times and still have some left
didnt do anything for me
these are amazing i use them to drive through the canyons and they are extremely helpful they also help you to stay calm and not get anxiety because you cant see the oncoming cars with their bright lights i recommend these to anybody especially truck drivers or anybody who has to work during the night
perfect just what i needed to cut my husbands hair and mine
these cleaning sheets dont come with instructions re how much water to use i used half a sheet and a bucket and gradually added as i needed  the sheet dissolved easily and the detergent worked well  i like that it is so easy to store and such a space saver thus ecofriendly  i wasnt sure if it would work as well as regular cleanser but it was effective and did not give off the toxic fumesscent
ive never used a water flosser before but wanted to try one so glad i did this flosser has a good size reservoir for one cleaning has all the attachments you need for various purposes works great and happy with this particular product its also easy to charge and can be transportable
these wipes work great for cleaning lenses they are easy to use and i like that you can simply throw them away i would buy them again
their orange cream flavor tastes so much better
good product thank you
this is a bit stronger because it does have alcoholwhich is what i prefer as it works best for me
product packaging was poor with no protection for a thin box product itself seems to be undamaged quality of product is fine
i forgot i had it but mut say fewer lasting odors now plugged in all the time
i was very pleased on how much this belt helped with back pain and belly pressure especially for the low cost
never have seen such small pill boxes
i was very pleased with these rinsefree bath cloths by nurture they are larger than i expected thick and soft with just a little bit of water and a couple squeezes they produce a nice lather that for me was enough to wipe my entire body the lather isnt so thick that you feel you need to rinse and it dries comfortably without feeling sticky or stiff these are handy for camping for travel for those who are ill or recovering from surgery or for a gym bag very versatile very easy to use
this is a good idea in theory but poorly executedtheres not much in the way of pros and many conspros   1 washable and reusable   1 as others have mentioned this opens up the sides of the mask so so much that it effectively means that youre getting unfiltered air coming in   2 these dont fit an adult face unless you have a small chin to get the mask to cover the nose the bottom edge of the mask will press into your skin above your chin and below your bottom lip its not a super sharp plastic edge but its enough to make a mark when you wear it for a while   3 theres nothing to attach this to the mask so when you remove the mask this will fall off onto the floor or the ground unless you remember to catch it as it falls   4 it doesnt work with regards to preventing your exhalation from fogging up your glasses  it does reduce it a tiny bit but not nearly enough to be usefuli really wish this worked as described although it might work for children hardpass on this particular mask insert well see how some of the others work
this is ok but not great  it says not to use your finger but it doesnt have an applicator so i guess youre supposed to use a tissue  it burned a little when i first put it on  later when i had to wipe it felt a bit numb so i guess the numbing property does work  i dont really like it as much as some of the name brand ones i have
great purchase
not long enough
needs to be more evident what the scent is imo
so far so good they are placed in the lawn and hopefully protecting from gophers
trinova grill cleaner spray for bbq  works great just spray and let it still a little while then you have to scrub at it a little bit makes it a lot easier then just trying to use water with the scrubbing tool
weve already happily gone through two sets of these great simple teether we tend to keep one in every baby bag to have on hand
very messy to use leakingplease take it back
doesnt dissolve  i followed the directions from the online description  package did not come with instructions  could not see my using it to gift
hard to lose or misplacethey are hanging around your neck when not in use  the masks are designed to adjust to your face  no more ears flapping in the wind  wonderful idea  i wont purchase an imported mask to protect me from a virus that was imported  i ordered a black and a white mask on a saturday and received them on monday morning
i like the idea of a finger brush to brush my dogs teeth but i think the bristles are too soft to clean anything
the cider vinegar does seem to improve digestion not that i have a particular problem the cider vinegar gets me through the day without noticing digestive nuancethey taste good at the end of my supplement taking session i like them try them for a week and you might notice a benefit
you now theres no getting around it a half hours worth of basic research on the internet will prove that em fields have minimal if any effect on humans health however if the conspiratorial side of you is dead set on protecting itself from the evils that are wifi signals microwave emissions etc then this is the product for youall judgement aside i have to say that shortly after applying the product to the underbelly of my laptop i began noticing extreme lagging on my pc im talking snails heredoes the product work well it shot my pc to heck so im assuming yes and if thats what youre going for than five staras for me im peeling it off nowi hate to be totally negative so here are a few positive aspects of the product lightweight peals easily doesnt smell of glue whatsoever easy to cut and mold to your preferred shape actuallylikely does what it says it does can be a neg or possplease see my youtube video review for a demo and moredisclaimer free for review
love this product  tastes great no chemical after taste  been sick once in three years feel great with lots of energy
i love this brand these came at the perfect time because everyone around me has a cold these are a lot more gentler on my nose than the weird off brand my company orders  these dont dry my nose out as bad at the othersi like that these are thick and dont fall apart and the boxes have an appealing design
very nice worth the money
the sponges are what you would expect to buy at a dollar store the steel wool should hold up for many months  the sponges i expect will last a month
i have eyelash extensions and this mask fits perfectly without damaging the extension will buy again in a heartbeat
i bought one of these for each of my cars and have been very happy with it its the perfect size to hold a lot of stuff but not take up too much space in the trunk i fit every kind of first aid item i might need into it and still have some room to spare bandages glove flashlight little reflective trauma blankets pain killers and a ton of other stuff has a good system of pockets and dividers to organize things as well i put different categories of things in ziplocks for the larger pockets and put some things by themselves in the side pockets
i have been using these for dishwashing and they are little big for me  but they are workable  i have used the other pair for bathroom cleaning and same thing  they hold well enough  they have long sleeves and seem to be really good quality  great cleaning and dishwashing gloves
good fit  decent backing  not as plush as some but nonetheless a very good liner at a good price
these are on point
this has an awesome taste but what i didnt love was the fact  that although they said on their website it is third party certified i didnt see the seal on the product itself
my mum looks beautiful in blue  everyone is happy with the stand out color and solid construction  thank you for making this cherished urn to hold our mum
this sound machine comes with a total of 28 sounds 18 are under the white noise button and 12 are under the lullaby button this is a plugin unit and comes with a usb cable but no ac adapter the unit itself and a regular instruction pamphletoperation is simple as per my video all the controls are on the top front of the unit i have to hold press the onoff button to turn it on and do the same to turn it offthere are seven operational buttons on the top the timer can be set for 30 60 or 90 minutes or turned off for continuous play the unit can be used as a nightlight only or with the soundmost of the sounds are crisp but a couple are a bit staticky and that is the reason i rated this 4 instead of 5 starsthe current price of 2339 2599 minus 10 is competitively priced
worked great for a web
the two buttons are not enough i needed 3 buttons on each flap side in order to secure it for both my toddler and newborn
it works as described but i bought it without reading the ingredients and it contains egg yolk which i am allergic to it
i waited 6 months to post my review because i wanted to use this iron long enough i am a seamster  i use my iron every day i have had many irons in my 75 years of life listen to me and do not buy this iron it does not steam but it pours the water in one part of your fabric while other parts are dry this iron has not been made for even nice steam something is wrong i use only distilled water dont pay even 10 dollars for this iron
easy way to get your fiber and no mixing
smells fresh and clean makescleaning the shower easy
love these they work just great my only peeve is that they squeak but i remedied that by coating the squeaky parts with graphite as a dry lubricant so that it didnt collect dust and hair i have advanced peripheral neuropathy a nerve condition so walking is a pain the cane i used just doesnt cut it anymore i needed support on both sides so i puchased these and can move around swiftly instead of slow
im stocking up on all immune boosters from here on out elderberry gummies are at the top of my list and these gummies have echinacea as well to boost immunity love the gummies since they taste good and are super easy to chew for the kids as well i am convinced after using them through cold and flu season that they really do help
purchased this so that my girlfriend and i could better track our weightprogress as we both work towards getting into better shape the scale appears to be well constructed works as intended and looks great to boot
flavor not as bad as described
these are now something you may need if wearing a mask for  many hours a day several days a week  the silicone doesnt pull on your hair so its comfortable it can be a bit small depending on the size of your head my husband has a big head and it can be tight depending on the mask straps  they worked fine for me and they have saved my ears from chafing  the ear loops hook easily over the button thingy on the extender  th extender has a small amount  of stretch so you can adjust your mask for the comfort level you prefer
like magic these things scrap away dirt like nothing else i finally found a product that does not scratch but gets dirt off my only problem is they really are one shot only and deteriorate very quickly they cannot take much abuse but they do what no other sponge can
these brake after flossing one or 2 teeth i had to throw them away
good suction not super long with the thickness not so much for beginners good buy though
these drink packets are perfect for rehydrating after a long bike ride they are very compact and light which is nice for being out and about the drink has nice flavor and isnt overly fruity or sugary
great product thanks
arrive as promised  was as described  nicely packaged
this is an excellent blood pressure monitor there are only a few minor quibbles that doesnt take away from how good the unit performspluses very well made attractive shape and appearance large easy to read display well written  informative user guide voice prompts provide start status and read out of results 2 user memory function cuff has instructions that provide guidance on proper fit micro usb power option results were accurate in line with results received during annual physical examminuses 3 aaa batteries not included usb cable  charger are also not includedin a lot of cases with devices that take batteries you normally get really cheap noname batteries i dont mind that theyre not included as id rather spend the money on good quality alkalines or rechargeables but i can see where not having batteries to get you started would be a bummer likewise im not really disappointed that a charger isnt included especially at this price pointthose little inconveniences aside the unit works incredibly well its easy to know the direction when placing the cuff on the user guide is well written it was easy to follow the step by step instructions even though i could see the results on the large lcd screen it was to have the voice prompts let me know my results i see this as a great benefit to elderly people who may have a little trouble reading the screen and you can save your results to memory for 2 separate users to recall at a later date nice
ive been trying new dental products lately looking for something more natural that works i wont be ordering this again though it is not offensive in any way i just dont care for it it doesnt have much flavor or leave my breath fresh its crumbly and the bits can easily slip out of your mouth while brushing i do use an electronic toothbrush though so maybe with manual it might work better its just not for me
slim and well made  it fits perfectly at the end of my 1234 deep cupboard over the sink  the installation was easy because of the numerous slots available for drilling and anchoring the georgia pacific 21000 two ply style towels fit just right and pull out singularly without waste  this is the second commercialstyle towel dispenser that i have purchased for my kitchen in the last four years  the first one was a slim roll design that dispensed single ply towels  the double  ply towels dispensed with this unit are stronger and more absorbent requiring fewer towels for average cleanup in the kitchen  this was actually a costsaving investment
i like to use these to add to my laundry for an extra boost of cleanliness my bf gets sweaty and oily and that transfers to clothes and sheets i mix the borax and washing soda together and sprinkle a scoop into every load to keep the soil at bay they help my wash smell fresh and stay clean
i was hesitant to get this based on some of the negative reviews here  but the positive ones convinced me to try it  and the price was good enough that i thought 34why not34first of all i have fibromyalgia and have severe pains and have been desperate  im not someone who is comfortable to get a massage and even if i was i would be poor if i went as often as i would need to  so what to dook  i got it today and tried it about a half an hour ago  i think that alone tells you what i think of this spa mat  that i literally came on here to review it right away  i didnt even bother with 34low34 and went right to 34medium34 high seemed to scare me for the initial setting  i figured itd be similar to a tsunami  the power of the bubbles was amazing  gets you all over and was so powerful that the tub looked like a pot of crazy hot boiling water  and that was on mediumoh and yeah  while a 1015 minute bath is usually cool at the end this amazin beauty keep the water at a nice temp  regarding the mat floating  it does  some of the suction cups stuck great and others did not  frankly who cares  this is supposed to make the water bubble and it does that job fantastically  made me feel good and relaxed   woolastly  other people complained about the noise  the noise of the unit is quiet  the massive bubbling is noisy    and seriously if youre complaining about bubbling noise then why did you get a 34body bubbles bath spa34 mat  lol  personally i liked it and it reminded me of being on vacation and in a big hot tuband for storage i figured that since ill likely be using it 23 times a week the best way to store the mat is just to stick it on the side of the shower wall   perfect so the excess water can drain out and it can dry well
very nice  looks just as pictured  i put a yarn project keeper some yarn and a couple other small items without trouble  the measurements given were active  the ribbon is lovely thick satin ribbon and is white  plenty of it with lots of tail after closing the top  the material of the bag is thin but effective  i cant see through it  i would buy again  its a lovely reusable gift bag it arrived quickly i have prime and in great shape along with other items i ordered
a word of caution im sensitive to stimulants so the first 3 days this messed with my stomach a bit after that im good to go at 178lbs the recommended dosage is 22 scoops for me because im sensitive to stimulants that is just too much everytime i do two scoops i end up bonking mid workout shaky hands starving have to stop and eat and rest a good half hour before finishing i always eat an hour before my workout and only have this issue with two scoops one scoop for me is perfect makes my face tingle helps me kill my workout i love this stuff so my recommendation is to try it in different dosages until you find your sweet spot maybe you are a 12 scoop person maybe you need the full two scoops ust dont try it once and say its not for you give it time give it a chance youll love it
i definitely need something else
not only are these very helpful when you have a sick child with the flu etcmy husband had open heart surgery over a month ago but when he came home from the hospital his electrolyteswhere still offi mixed one of these with water he drank it as his dr told him too when he called him to say howawful he was feeling this mommys bliss saved us a trip back to the hospital but put my husband back on track to recovering
i like it its smaller than most pill organizers which i prefer since i only take a few pills but honestly it isnt worth more than 34 wait for the price to go down because even paying 5 for this i thought i was overcharged if you really love the aesthetic of the rainbow go for it but if you need more space for vitamins and pills get something else
great for camping or your purse for any cleanups i dont think its worth the money though  theyre not so high quality that its worth it individual packing and natural is why i liked them but wont be repurchasing
only thing is i have a pacemaker and you cant use this product with a pacemaker therefore its useless to me  my husband loves it for his back and legs though  so it turned out as a great present  lol
these drops stopped the stingingitching immediately upon first use im pleased
very convenient and effective product
this provides a subtle as in very subtle differencei cant say that it was enough to justify the price but everyone is different in that area in addition everyones body is different and yours may respond better than minei definitely believe in the theory behind it but im the sort of person that cant wear certain watches because they stop or i touch light switches and get a little shock even when there is no activity that would cause it such as walking on a carpet creating static electricityso do give it a try this is one of those items that cant hurt and might help my hope is that it helps you more than its helped me best of luck to you
the flavor is great the price is ridiculous
bought this for my disabled son i tried it first and liked it so much that i ordered one for myself finally a brush that works
i mean its a working scale works great looks nice in comparison to my crusty bathroom love that
my mom love it been using for 30yrs
this lavender essential oil already has 102 reviews with a high star rating so i doubt i can add anything unique to say about it  it has a lovely lavender scent and i will be using this to scent my hand made soaps
these are sturdy lomg lasting arch and heel supports they are firm but with some give have a high heel and higher arch supports the only inserts ill use for preventing heel pain and supporting my unusually high arches
i have 3 large dogs and it can some times be a chore to brush their teeth every morning  however with this full surround finger toothbrush brushing is so much easier and faster  my dogs dont seem to fight me as much as when i was using the regular toothbrushes or the other finger brushes  one of my dogs shes the youngest at 16 mos old almost seems to enjoy her morning brushing  this toothbrush is really soft extra soft which is my 1 concern  i wish the bristles where a little less soft sometimes i wonder if their teeth are really getting a good cleaning because the brush is so soft  its great to massage their gums  this brush has made a world of difference for my dogs  they let me brush their teeth  its great
easy to use and wash nicely love having the supply of these to grab and go
i purchased this because i recently started taking online classes again and i will be spending more time in my desk chair poor body mechanics can cause back pain breakdown of joints etc this cushion was just what i needed to help me obtain good posture and prevent a sore booty
sometimes we often need a fork and dont want to have to wash one upweighing the disposable factor against the use of water and soap for one fork is sometimes stressfulthese forks eliminate that 100 compostable and disposablethese are more like the salad size fork but could be for smaller kids who cant yet manage a bigger forkdurable and better for the environmentpretty happy with these and i know theyll last a long time in my house in the event i need to get more  ill definitely get thesefyi the bigger fork is from a different set these are the forks on the right
cute christmasthemed cover with invisible zipper that will fit any standard cushion and liven up the living room its soft to touch and kids love it its a nice fun splash of color
great for nails
its the real deal love it
simple shoe brush  works as expected nice cover flap
my husbands nice prescription glasses lost one of their nose pieces and we didnt want to go back to the eye doctor so i found these on amazon and decided to give them a try  they were the perfect replacement for the one he lost and are exactly the same quality as those that came from an optical dispensary  there are enough in this package that i probably wont ever have to buy another pair
bulk supplements are the best ive found i have been doing alot of research on supplements and i love this company for a few reasons mostly the purity of the products no fillers on what i have gotten and the price is affordable so i am more happy to try new items i started researching these items for my cats glucosamine helps cats bladder tissue rebuild the chondrotin helps prevent damage to the bladder lining  i only use this company for my cats because their systems are so delicate and having the supplements in powder form helps with dosing and the purity is a great bonus now i am trying new supplements for myself and i have this company to thank i will be a life time buyer
this product was very easy to put together and i love that i can use my own floor product it sprayed nicely and evenly and didnt leak the pad secured nicely to the base with velcro and you can throw the pads in the wash it is as pictured and does a nice job
this snack is really delicious and its packed full of energy
i do not like nuts so hard to find a protien bar wo them these taste good and are very fillingsurprising for how tiny they are company stuck some extra samples in the box which was nice hubby had to eat the nut one the lemon was great and i will order it next
great prank gift
these are soooooooo tiny and cute and great size for travel but really hard to dispense from i filled one each with lavender peppermint frankincense purify serenity sunny citrus and tea tree none of them would dispense even one drop i had to shake shake shake you dont get a very accurate portion that way and sometimes id see a film develop on the water of my travel diffuser so i knew something had come out but what a pain no drops  im at a loss for how to actually use the oils from these little jars you cant use a dropper unless you use separate ones for each oil and of course take off the reducer otherwise youll contaminatemix due to residue of each oil in the dropper and who is going to carry around 8 droppers how do you get these to work suggestions
battery connection isdelicate be gentle
all three of these broke with minimal ease of use within minutes  do not buy i paid 10 for pure trash
i almost wish someone i knew would have a birthday soon just to have an excuse to gift one of these bags i ordered the all occasion bags with balloons and it was much better than pictured  the material is sturdy better than your typical gift bag found at a 99 cent store and quite attractive it doesnt say happy birthday but it seems the holiday best suited for using these bags though the bag could also be used for promotions graduation gifts and anything celebratory note that the handles looking like shoelaces are packaged separately and you have to insert them by hand into each one i found this to be a little bit of a pain but i guess it made it easier to ship overall im happy with it
i love this have it at the head of my bed and i use it every single night it blocks out noise
hair drags concerned about damagedoesnt heat hot enoughdont buy
tastes yummy and its good for you im lactose intolerant so i cannot drink other protein drinks im addicted to caffeine and coffee tasting products
excellent for allergies unlike the the overthecounter meds these herbs have no side effects
not the best but good for the money
as a healthcare worker i wear masks 14 hours the straps dig in my ears causing blisters a n95 mask would be better but all we get all the thin disposable masksthese strap extenders take the straps off the ears the silicone extender is barely noticeable finally my ears are getting some relief
i paid more money than i want to admit for a custom acrylic tub in a 35 year old bathroom  it can only be cleaned with vinegar  yeh  so this hella expensive tub is a pain until i got these magic erasers oh em gee the scum just rolls off the tub and it looks brand new  i do not know how i would keep it clean without them because vinegar is a great cleaner and i use it a lot but you need something to 34scrub34 with that wont scratch  voila
these are perfect for home manicures
is pretty good stuff and will buy again  thank you
i got the giggles as this thing made my daughters hair and scalp quite literally squeaky clean her hair is insanely thick but very fine and also long weve been battling dandruff for years and tried everything this has been a terrific help and it somehow doesnt tangle her hair in the process im absolutely stoked on this thing and so grateful i stumbled across it
came leaky
this was fine except for two things1  its thicker than i thought  it would not fit in the side pocket of my purse2  the one i received the top open too easily  just a baby bump against the closure and out popped all of my pillsso i returned this item
as expected fresh product date perfect
im sorry but i just couldt manage to make this fit in my ear well enough to block sound as designed despite repeated attempts
good price and work very well
works well but i dont get why they are using glass which breaks easily and is dangerous especially when u consider that most of us will stand on it barefootedweigh ourselves naked etc surely luciteacrylic would make more sense
originally i thought these files would work just like my crystal nail file from perfect formula a file i have had for years my nails were all finally strong healthy and grown outafter using these files my nails are shredding peeling and down to the nubs several of the top layers of my nails are peeling back even further some nails have 2 3  4 cracks up the nail i just had a horribly painful crack and it tore to the skini thought all these crystal nail files would be the same but they are not
this is the 2nd one ive bought i purchased this because it was dual voltage and we were headed to ireland i used it at home and i really liked the hot brush but the flat iron not so muchthe plates dont touch when i used it in ireland the digital temp display got really hot burned out and stopped working i was about to throw it out and tried one more time to use it and the brush got hot but no digital temp display i used it for the rest of our trip but when we got home it wouldnt turn on  so i ordered another because it really does cut down on my styling time people mention the problem with the button placement but you can lock the temp by double clicking the offon button a couple of times once it reaches the temp you want
the awesome and perfect cloth mask heres my longest review ever and why this is the awesome ppe for mewe have several other masks cloth and disposable masks to compare these masks against i must tell everyone these masks rockseriously this mask is soft soft like a high quality tight woven brushed cotton and soft tshirt that feels so good i cant wait for it to be washedmade in the usa by americans look up their websitei dont know them but i know where they are and they stopped production and are only making face masksthe mask has adjustable ear loops a pouch for inserts like those charcoal filters if you so choosethe mask is so comfortable but here are more reasons why i will wear this mask every time i can because of a unique feature of the strap that goes behind my head furthermore not putting pressure on my head or neck simply rests on my back so i can take the mask off when safe and it simply hangs on my chest or lower no longer having to put it in the visor risk it touching anything but my shirt period i dont have to look for it when i get out of the truck or put it in the pocket my phone was in as cellphones are nasty even though you clean them because i simply raise my mask up by the ear loops and slip it on my ears and snug the strap if its loose double layer full coverage mask from bridge of my nose to under my chin comfortable all day i dont use the carbon filters if needed i would  put a disposable mask in the pocket area on a as necessary basisi dont think i have been so excited about a product since my first boom box just kidding since my iphonethese comes in two different sizes i wear the xl i have wide cheek bones and im chubby my spouse wears the large and has a narrower jawline shaped face and chubbythank you buttonsmith for your part in helping with covid19 by producing more comfortable ppe its hard enough as it islastly mine were shipped out a bit faster than expectedi ordered more
the yellow shelf fell apart in my hand as i was trying to install it  as i tightened the wingnut it unscrewed itself from the wood  ill need to get some glue and see if that will fix it
not just this one but others that i tried just do not work when training a puppy  on this one  i cleaned the pee spot and sprayed it on  puppy went back to the spot and peed next to it  it would be funny if i wasnt peeved
i have spent years making homemade bread for my family and one of my most important tools has been a plastic dough scraper i got from a king arthur seminar several years ago without explanation my scraper simply disappeared without a trace and no one knows what happened to it i think it got tossed in the trash by accident i went about finding a replacement and after looking at a number of products i chose this one based on the price and the positive reviews it has proven to be a good tool a little different than my old scraper but still fine for my needsinstead of plastic this one is stainless steel encased in silicone there are a couple of important factors here first because of the silicone shell the scraping edge is soft and pliable this is helpful for scraping around crevices and getting as much dough from a round plastic bowl as possible  because of the stainless steel inside the whole is stiff though still slightly bendable which allows it to flex just enough to clean the bowl of my stand mixer without fatigue or permanently getting warped or bent it is stiffer than my old plastic scraper and while this is a positive thing it does require getting used to itunlike my old plastic scraper this one will work on a hot saucepan thats good news for when i am making candy and dont want to wait for the syrup to cool and harden requiring a lot more effort to remove i did not find any statement regarding the temperature limit for this scraper but based on other silicone utensils i have it is probably safe up to around 400 degrees fandsilicone is more nonstick than plastic so cleanup is a little easier it was never bad with with my plastic scraper but it did require a bit more effort than this new scraper just because of the nature of the materials of eachim very pleased with this scraper it meets the need i had and it is better than my old plastic scraper that i used for years it works well it can be used on hot or cold cookware and it is very easy to clean its reasonably priced too based on my experience this is a very easy product to recommend
wow i wasnt expecting this dual sided silicone body brush to be as amazing as it is i use the same amount of body wash as usual and lots of soft foam is produced the bristles are soft but very effective even if they dont feel that way at first the other side is nubby and works nicely for feet knees etc its a little heavy but not overly dries quickly and i can even sanitize it
tried the detox via the ion foot bath at a friends house they had a very expensive machine being cheap i looked at various machines and settled on this one works like a champ and glad i bought it because of the 5 yr warranty and being stateside was the clincher have used it many times on a regular basis 2 days on and one off easy instructions cant go wrong i threw in ton of salt to see what would happen alarm went off and reset it use very little salt great product and fast delivery worth it
bought it for my father in law to help with the cancer and it irritated his skin must find right portion to use maybe
steaming veggies in bags is absolutely the way to go to get perfectly steamed veggies in less than a couple minutes  you just stick the veggies in the bag unzip the adhesive area flip the flap over toss in the microwave and cook for the time you want to get the veggies as you like them  example i like asparagus still slightly firm  i can cook 12 pound in these in about 2 minutes tops  follow their time instructions and tinker a bit to get veggies the way you like them  no pots no steamer devices no mess  im your basic guy who doesnt like to cook  these are perfect
generic brand of vaseline seems to be identical to name brand multipurpose and handy to have on hand i have tried one other product from solimo a spray sunscreen and have been very happy with it seems to be a quality line of products
this does what its supposed to  it holds my mask in place securely without hurting my ears
for some reason the pharmacy we use dispenses our medicines in adult proof packaging after a real struggle we take the pills out of that and put them into these little bottles we peel the labels off the pharmacy bottles or paper cartons and tape them to these the lids are easy to open but stay shut in a pocket or purse i would not recommend if you have children or grandchildren around
returned  small and cheap
too many wild designs rather 10 of solid colors
love their products
i found this mouth guard several years ago and have been a fan ever since  i hated the expensive ones the dentist made as well as the boil and fit ones in the drug store  this mouth guard is comfortable you hardly know it is there  it does the job  i highly recommend it  mine last about a year
the ingredients of this fish oil is great it works great for me and i heard its great for lower cholesterol
i use this and nonstick pads instead of bandaids i have bad reactions to the adhesives on bandaids and this tape saves me everytime easy to cut the shape you need
has a point not normally found on carbide files
these are cute and my son loves themi just wish there was more option in style like mario or luigi on the bandaids not just the 34enemies34 and more than 20 bandaids in the package
i consume this in smoothies and it is easily blendable 1 serving is a small scoop around a tsp size so it really lasts that said in that small amount you are getting a supplement highly enriched in the daily value of vitamin a and b it is a cracked cell wall form so the nutrients are bioavailable i didnt expect it to taste very good so i try to hide the flavor with fruits for example but it still kind of tastes like i am drinking a vitamin
i work in the yard a lot esp this time of year and my feet would start aching started using blue emu foot therapy cream and i now have no issues  also this cream smooths out the slight cracks in my heels
im not totally sure this is helping this whole pandemic thing has messed with everything but the fact that these are a capsule instead of a powder is a winner for me i cant stand the taste of most of those things and just that alone is a turn off i was totally skeptical but while im not sure how much of a benefit they are i can say that they havent caused any negatives so that alone makes them worth a try
i wont buy this again for 62 a bottle theres no way this shouldnt be organic  i would buy it again if it was
this is the perfect item for those whose vision is impaired  my stepmom has macular degeneration and this was ez for her to operate
these work well inflation is easy and completely adjustable
the convience  the durability  makes things faster in shower getting ready for work
this is the pill case i have used lots of these things over the years and this one is it the rainbow coloring is so cheerful first off who wants a boring old pill container when you can have these beautiful colors to look forward to every morning and evening not me give me a rainbow any day to make popping that fish oil a bit more pleasurable speaking of fish oil this container is huge you can fit a lot of pills in each compartment so you can go to town with your vitamin gobbling without worrying about running out of space the tops of each pill container pop up nicely with the little levers and the whole thing is like a transformer you can take off one day or two or whatever for traveling and leave the rest at home very happy with this purchase
these are some of the best protein bars ive ever had delicious and no chemical aftertaste every flavor is great but the white chocolate cookie is my favorite
the price on these is too high they work somewhat as intended but are more likely to be worth about 2
i received this 2 weeks ago and it was very good  i open and close it 3 times a day  the hinge is already noticeably loose  i dont expect it to last long
very good product that helps reduce symptoms when its impossible to avoid all high histamine foods every day i appreciate being able to get two bottles at a time bc sometimes i need more than 1 bottle a month sometimes you need two caps a day not just one
they are beautiful and exactly like pic
handle is very wobbly and the manufacturer will not all returns
no i dont have a baby  i have wicked dry skin thats also sensitive so i thought id give this a shot  and it works  i smooth it on in the shower pat dry and my skin feels so much better  its got a very mild scent which is not at all offensive and its easy to apply  i wish it was a bit cheaper and thats the reason its only four stars instead of five  but its a good product so i suppose its worth whatever its worth right
this tastes horrible and doesnt dissolve in cold liquids  i tried apple juice and it just left clumps tried both adding to cup before and after liquid  i decided to try using it in coffee and it tasted horrible  i added some hot chocolate and it still tastes horrible but slightly less so  i certainly wish i didnt get the 8oz container to start  oh well  so far no major herx reactions  teasel root usually is within a few hours this has been a three doses so far
perfect for elipens and the orange color stands out when in the bottom of a backpack or a purse or whoever you leave them
this is exactly what i was looking for for my vape waxshatter now i just need to figure out who to buy the dual coil dabber
i purchased this for my sister and she loves it  the animal covers make this such a cute and practical gift
these are great roller bottles for using with my essential oil recipes love them
great little curing iron
i have been taking the etana immune blend supplement and i like it it contains the key ingredients to help protect my immune system these capsules are standard size and easy to swallow also there is no bad taste or aftertaste well see how it holds up as america reopens from the pandemic
scraped my shin down to the bone  i use these daily to protect my shin  so easy to use
i opened the box and looked at this curler and then read the instructions  am i suppose to shove the end of my hair into the open end  does it pull my hair in and around the round device inside the holethere are no instructions about how exactly to use this and there is only one picture showing end of hair in the open hole  so i decided to try this out  the music is cute but not really neededtried different ways of trying to get my hair in it and finally it pulled it in and stopped  my hair was jammed around the insidenow im sitting here and hoping it wasnt going to burn it before i can figure a way to get my hair out without cutting iti just kept pulling while pushing the button  after 10 mins i finally got my hair out of it  packed it up and wont try it againill stick with a regular curling iron
ive suffered from migraines for about 11 years technically i just get the migraine auras plus strong light sensitivity that irritates my eyes these glasses do help although they arent going to completely fix your problem according to medical studies green light is the easiest light on the eyes and brain for people who suffer from migraines the green tint is soothing reduces how much bright lights normally irritates my eyes and helps to prevent getting a migraine to be clear i get some migraines when wearing these from time to time but they still help in reducing light sensitivity and reducing chance of getting a migraine i also like that it has the green part of the glasses on the side to protect light coming in from your peripheral vision i wear them daily at work when staring the computer all day
who doesnt like bath bombs well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me these bath bombs are great they are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath the fragrances these have are fantastic i tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to plain vanillayou get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over 20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it these come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me i will probably have to get these again when i am out the only one i am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint but that is because i just dont like that fragrance but it will come in handy when i have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses
i had not heard of dmannose and cranberry supplement until a few months ago when i was desperately seeking relief from utis every few months id been taking apple cider vinegar cream of tartar and baking soda which works well but takes too longafter the first sign of another uti i took three of these for 5 days and i stopped having any symptoms from day one it never did turn into a fullblown uti ive been taking one a day ever sinceim so thankful to have found this as utis are so painful and irritating its nice to have something that will help keep them away though this is a bit expensive it works very well i might look for a coupon or shop around when i run out but i would absolutely recommend taking dmannose and cranberry supplements
this isnt moisturizing but just runny dont waste your money and get the simple vaseline that we all know
i agree with first reviewer too thick does not appy easily tends to stick to plastic tube applicator tip not metal like muro 128 very bad product not well formulated for humans would not use on the dog either
this is a huge spatula  i like that it is almost straight indeed i was hoping it would be completely straight up and down unlike a turner  note the picture where i compare this wood spatula to my pink silicone and ss turner that is much more angular  i wanted to have something with a firm base but a straighter design because a friend showed me that her straight up and down wooden spatula puts a lot less stress on the wrists when breaking up big batches of ground beef and shifting them around  i tried to purchase a silicone head straight up and down spatula from le creuset but for my intended use it was a waste of moneynot firm enough and with too narrow of a head  i am really looking forward to using this instead  i do wish that instructions for the proper care of the wood apart from not putting in the dishwasher were included as i am unused to wooden implements  also there are a couple of slight indentations in the wood on the very bottom edge of the spatula this may be customary in natural wood products but i simply dont know if it is  but other than that i am pleasedpotential customers may be interested to note that this is large definitely larger than most turnersspatulas i have previously encountered that the bottom is almost but not quite flatstraight across and that the corners of the bottom curve in ever so slightly in addition to the slight angle of the mostlystraighton head  it can be hard to tell details from pictures  i received this item at a discount in exchange for leaving an unbiased review and i count myself lucky as i had basically been looking for precisely this item
i used to give out homemade candy for my auxiliary ladies they were a hit
cant taste this at all i put it in my coffee in the morning when i remember  but i do like the fact that you can mix it with anything stir and youre done no after taste isnt in the bottom of your cup would recommend
exstreamly cheaply made
this is all new to me what a wonderful extract i have used it for a week or so and i feel more energy and overall well being i purchased this for a discount for my honest opinion
i like these loofah soaps these however seemed like the loofah was placed too close to the edge in the past they were in the middle of the soap bar but i like the soap the scents and the price will try again
worked great at first then stopped working right after return window was closed
does a great job cleaning
great item good price fast ship
i got this to mix with water to put magnolia leaves in per things i read  it worked and the magnolia leaves are not brittle and work and look good in an arrangement
strong electric motor quality construction works very well
does no work at all very disappointed received it over the weekend and added some as directed but it was still slipping  and to add the wax got into one of my lens and now the lens is blurry and stained so technically my glasses got messed up because of this product
this was easy to swallow  unfortunately did nothing for me
i also purchased this with a groupon and its a piece of junk it barely heats up at all and does very little to curl my lashes wish i hadnt thrown the packaging and stuff away bc id return it if i could i like my panasonic one much better although you have to hold the switch down to get it to heat i bought this one thinking it would heat while i was doing other things which it does it just doesnt curl very well
as described you cant beat the price ive used the big name brand ones and this brand does the job well
not a lot to say because its so simple but it works perfectly well and is great for people with fobs or separate keys they need to get apart quickly
elegant it is and heavy too just a note to make sure the suction pad is tight before hanging the squeegee  it hung best against the glass shower door not so much on the wall  besides its sleek look it functions pretty awesomely with its long length to cover a wide area and the rubber worked well to pull the moisture off the surface  a good squeegee
they are adorable
i tried to remove baked on gunk on my cookie sheets but not very successful these fell apart after use with a little elbow grease wont buy again
didnt feel much change in the fridge
i highly recommend this walk air purifier works extremely well specially if you have a small room
these are so stiff that it takes a lot of pressure to plunge the syringe instead i end up losing some of the meds before my dogs and cats get their full doses not great when youre trying to administer meds while holding a squirmy angry pet plus they are literally single use they get stuck after 1 use and cannot be used again
great supplement quality and quick and packaged well
a little too high and deep for a neck pillow for me but works great behind the knees or in front of my other orthopedic pillows to elevate my legs or to ease my spine nicely made no smell soft at the very top but firm at the core very comfortable for knees and legs wide enough for larger than average legs although very large or very heavy legs may wear it out sooner  im a tall gal big gal with longer than average legs its holding up quite well for me after several months nice zippered pillow case  im happy with it  i hope they continue to manufacture these because when this one wears out i will rebuy if you sweat a lot you might want to cover it with a towel to make it last longer this material breaks down in damp and humid air hence it will get flatter sooner so keep it dry
this polisher did exactly what i wanted it to do
i have been purchasing and using eo lavender hand cleansing wipes for years  eo products are the very best quality in overall product generation  the lavender fragrance with essential oils is beyond amazing  cant say enough about how much i truly love and enjoy
the photo showed a container with 32 onces of hydrogen peroxide but the description is for half of that  the price is exorbitant if you only get half of what is shown in the photo
sprayer doesnt work very little comes out and difficultgets stuck when you press down to spray
i admit i bought these because i couldnt find my normal disposable wipes anywhere i didnt think id be impressed but in 2020  you make do well i am so pleasantly surprised with these not only are they super soft but they do the job well thanks
i tried this out right away on some wood handle knives we have  absorbed in quick and really conditioned the very dry wood they go through to dishwasher which is horrible to do to any knife let a lone a wood handled  seems to leave a finish on the wood that should work to protect it from water  super easy to use and no bad odor  love the food safe aspect and im going to use this on the wooden cider press i have  great product
i bought this to keep with me on my recent trip to several asian countries those countries are notorious for not providing soap in restrooms this travel soap worked perfectly for my needs i am incessantly needing to keep my hands clean and this helped my mild obsession i also wear contact lenses and require clean hands for handling the contacts i never got an eye infection despite the questionable water supply ill attribute that safety to the good soap i was using buy it
very comfortable hopefully wont have to use one again but it was a great choice bevause you can pump it up to ur contour it inflates around ankle amd shin area
i wish they were different grades of courseness but these are all the same and a little too course but ok
i really like this jewelry organizer it has lots of compartments for all my bracelets to fit securely it has some zippered pockets too i cant wait to travel with it
this ice pack works on small area like my handbut comes out of the freezer very hard i need to wait a while for it to soften and be more comfortable but i do like that it is not bulky or difficult for me to hold
if you must save on space consider these laundry soap sheets  i will be honest though hotel bar soap and baby wash made my clothes smell and therefor feel cleaner to me when doing laundry in the sink  the soap sheets were easier to rinse out than the alternatives but i do appreciate a good sudsing  one time during our trip i ended up with a shirt so stinky after one day on a train and i am not a stinky woman usually that these sheets made the shirt a lost cause  ill blame it on the turkish food but man these things could not keep up  i ended up trying a combination of hand sanitizer bar soap this stuff and downy spray but the initial wash seemed to 34set34 the stink
neat concept but the design still needs work when working properly it is convenient to have the capability to store snacks in one side or water and a preintraworkout it is however not without flawleaking i have one of the older versions of this shaker and noted leaking as a main issue this was supposed to have been one of the areas of improvement on newer models but its still not perfect yetdurability 1 drop from no more than 2 feet rendered the shaker useless
this is the best bum cleaner everim a big girl and gained a bit more weight during the pandemic and started having issues reaching to clean my bum in the shower it wasnt pretty let me yell youi did some searching and comparing and settled on the butt scrubberi handle is long the yellow head is made of some type of silicone and very sturdyi got in the shower and soaped it up and got to work and trust me this device gets in there and cleans everything my cheeks are tight so wrapping a towel around the head is out of the question my bum is much cleaner these dayswhen im finished i soap it up rinse and place it upside down in a container solution of white vinegar and water and let it soak for a whiletrust me your bum will thank you for it
i cant smell this but for just a micro second after spraying it  it initially has a little bit of a bleach smell but then nothing  i sprayed some in my daughters really stinky running shoes and it helped a lot  i could use this in a gallon size since we have pets and stinky tennis shoes  it seems to work as advertised so unless it stops working i think it deserves 5 stars

im a true believer in the red light therapy camp ive had excellent results myself and have seen the same on others that being said i have a bad neck and was hoping this would be flexible enough to use there and hopefully improve it it does the job but is really hard to get it into place its easier on my shoulder or leg but i wish it was curved in shape for where i need it ill definitely use this but am still in search of
got it yesterday i am so delighted with this product i have kind of fine hair after my hair was washed and dried within minutes as a first time user my hair looked professionally done totally excellent certainly worth the money i am usually not handy with my kinky curly hair and i dread washing as i will have to fix it again to look presentable i would give this a 10 star if i could
this is the most yumm and perfect chocolatebeet powder  i use it in baking  its the only way that i can get my grankids to eat beets i use it in red velvet deserts too with red gel coloring for extra brightness  this has a great taste on its own even tho it has a bitter quality but that is part of the life of brilliant untreated chocolate  it blends into hot cocoa cream cheese batters whipped cream and when i whip cream into butter for a different spin on things and at that point i will add coconut sugar that has been finely ground into the whip as well to work on bringing sweetness there really is no limit to creation with this product im going to need to get more
i like vegetables but sometimes need to fix things quick with less mess and these steamer bags are great  the food tastes real and not like cooked in a microwave  no mess  just toss the bag when done  great

if your an active person this cover tape is what you may be looking for tape provides for a secure attachment of your sensor
i received this item very quickly that said it comes with absolutely no directionsnot even the picture that you see on the web page it arrives in a clear plastic type bagbut nothing else it takes some real getting used to once you put it on its better than a cpap but if you are sensitive to having something on your face this will cause you issues as for snoring ive been told that it has lessened my snoring somewhat but it has not eliminated it
this olive oil looks good smells good and tastes like high quality extra virgin olive oil took off a star because i dont know if this is a reputable company for something i will be consuming also costco is known to have some of the highest quality organic evoo so i usually just buy that
these have and excellent mix of fragrances with strong scents that are great for aromatherapy one or two did smell a little like alcohol which makes me wonder about additives as well as the fact that both rose and jasmine have their fragrances removed through water soluble methods more often than oil or fat soluble ones so i also wonder if those are real but i dont really care too much so whatever smells good its not like im eating it or anything
i love the product
very nice product  we got it to use for an art project and i really dont know the other uses for it lotions maybe  it seems to be very high quality  we only used a small amount so there is plenty left for next year and the price was excellent compared to small bottles sold locally
this fish oil has a pleasant light orange taste  i will repurchase it
these steamer bags are a great way to get your veggies in  i had bought the ziploc brand before for a lot more money but these are just as good quality and much less expensive
though the gray color put me off at first the results were greatsoft shiny hair the smell is strong but it  reminds me of a spa that uses a lot of natural products and i like it
great relief for my knee when i have the occasional stiffness from time to time i have a knee tightness that prevents me from walking straight it normally goes away after 2 days but it is a pain to walk and drag one leg the compression is just enough to make me walk and not strain too much
love how much curl it gives my lashes and they stay curled until i wash my face  the rotating wand is weird or maybe i am  cant figure out how or why to use it  also turning the rotating wand on and off takes a few tries  overall love the product
absolutely love this ive bought so many curling irons and ended up throwing themout because they dont get hot enough to curl my hair this definitely does the job i got the perfect curls with this and i just received the item yesterday curled my hair for a photoshoot with my son i have a lot of hair and thick hair and i didnt have a hard time what so ever highly recommend also got here right on time
i think these latexfree gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves they are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves i have worn regular latex gloves a lot especially when making my hand made soaps but i will be wearing these from now on i dont think im allergic to latex but i used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe i am these latexfree gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while
during the cold months of winter it is nice to use a furniture polish which shines up all your wood desks bookcases and tables i love endust because it makes wood glow with natural beauty and keeps dust at bay for at least a while until you can dust again i like that this leaves no greasy or oily residue it wipes off clean the scent is pleasant too and that makes cleaning more fun i find it works best to spray the cleaner onto a clean rag that way there is not over sprayingthe rebecca review
bought this for my sister to improve her grip strength she loves it and its adorable too
very soft works great
its  smells like my hair is always burning and the plates  dont seem to keep my hair straight  for more then a few hours
this smells so good and really does help detangle and defrizz my toddlers hair  we like it
its difficult  to hold especially  when the suds hit ur hands this needs to be a lil smaller but its not hard on the sclap
reviews for first aid products like this are more passfail than 15 stars the product packaging will hold up and keep the tube sterile the tube itself appears to be well made so yes i can recommend purchase for your first aid kit pass
how can i describe my exhaustive search for an applicator bottle for my hair oils that has a long tip so that you can part hair with it hair color applicator bottles are expenive and i just didnt want to pay that price anymore i want a nicely organized beauty closet so i was searching for applicator bottles to store my hair oils to ensure they dont spill over and have the long tip to make partings in my hair  sooo glad i found this bottle i will be ordering more to put each type of natural oil in them and will look nice in my closet really happy with this purchase the bottle is soft and squeezable and you have to cut the tip off to make an opening its also the right size not too tiny like whats in a craft store and not too big like many hair coloring bottles just perfect i can see the value of storing your crafting liquids in this and consider it for your beauty needs too  really happy
i have been taking apple cider vinegar with mother gummies for years this brand has more than just apple cider vinegar it also comes with b vitamins and other ingredients
i prefer the nasopure system kit for sinus irrigation because i can control the flow and the nozzle tip forms a better seal with my nostril than traditional ceramic neti pots the buffered salt solution is less likely to cause any irritation and its premeasured easy peasy just mix and apply a light squeazythe neti pot has been around for hundreds of years and when used properly it is the safest and most effective remedy to clear my stuffy sinuses and help relieve postnasal drip i cannot use the over the counter sinus meds because some make me drowsy and others give me palpitationsplease read1 the most important rule to remember and this is not optional is to never use tap water under any circumstances if you must use tap water let it boil for just over a minute or san and allow it to cool to room temperature before using  distilled sterile water is recommended and you can buy it in the grocery store2 if you are unfamiliar with the proper technique for using a neti pot there are many instructional videos on youtube this should be a safe and relatively comfortable experience3 clean the netipot after every use and let air dryplease follow ollow the instructions and read recommendations on the fdas website to ensure safe use and youre good to go if you found this review to be helpful at all please take a moment and click the button below to let amazon know thank you so much
while this product might not be for everyone for my situation its fabulousi have to watch every drop of water i use each of these generously sized mitts is in its own individual pouch as opposed to the more common dry mitts or cleansing towels that you add water to these are presaturated with a soapy smelling solution that cleans every inch of your bodya quick rinse and youre done with almost no water usagethis would be great for campers as well
im very happy with this set all four items came individually wrapped and they are all pretty nice quality especially given the price for all of them there were a couple loose stitches here and there but nothing majorthe glove has a cute pattern and a hole on each side of the bottom so it stays on your hand the loofah side feels nice and the exfoliating side actually works it makes my skin feel noticeably smoother after just one use but its not so rough it causes discomfort on my very sensitive skin the back loofah is especially nice and the material is very soft the regular loofah works very well and i actually had to start using less body wash on it because it works up ample lather with just a small amount they all have handles to hang them up to dry overall im happy with this purchase
i bought these to dress up my fence they look really great ive put different flowers and plants in them and they look really awesome on my fence
we had a couples baby shower and this game was part of the fun both the boys and the girls wanted to try to get their sperm directly on the egg
love this heated eyelash curler has 3 heat settings it does get hot its chargeable which is great and comes with extra styling tools with it hade a case or pouch to carry it all
this gel knee support comes in handy when i have a weak knee  periodically my knee tends to give out  with this i feel much more support to the area  this is a nice quality support with gel padding on the front where the front of the knee isthe material is strong  and most important breathable  oftentimes if you dont have breathing material it can become tight and sweaty  there is no opening just slip if through the food  i can do this while exercising because staying in place is importantcheck the sizes for sure before you order  mine is the xlarge and i am not large but the tightness is fine  maybe i should have received a smaller one but  right now this one worksnice support  good quality fit  review for gel knee support
i use this as my daily probiotic about a quarter cup a day and it has a wonderful taste  i would recommend to anyone
so we called this my husbands leg condom  due to an infection he had his prosthetic knee replacement removed and then six weeks later a new prosthetic knee implanted  this allowed him to shower with his leg restraint on without worry of contaminating the incision or getting his dressings wet  it looks really weird at first with the whole disc thing but it does work and is long enough for even a tall guy to use  it is tight so dont expect to wear it for a long twenty minute shower  highly recommend
people take curcumin for the antiinflammation benefit i dont personally notice anything from taking a lot of curcumin from many companies considering the relatively high price for curcumin i would like there to be a more noticeable benefiti measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them which is close to what i expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients it means these capsules have minimal to no fillers which is what they advertiseyou are after the curcumin not the turmeric so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing the current price is 13 for 90 pills which 144gram the 90pill bottle is 094gram the now brand 60 pill bottle costs 033gram the doctors best 120 pill bottle is 034gram nothing about this bleaf nature curcumin would suggest that it is a better product that is worth such a price premium over the established reputable brandsyou can buy tumeric root at the grocery store if that is what you want tumeric is too bulky relative to the active compounds for it to be a good supplement instead focus on supplements that contain just the curcumin extract and ones that contain more of the desired extract than what is in this pillmade in the usa in gmp certified facility
its honestly so cute i love it i used 7 slots for daily supplements and i use the 8th slot for tylenol
these are not the quality of others i have bought directly from local pharmacy stores  they will not clean in the earonly around the entrance to the ear canal
perfect as an addition to a raffle basket with a sleep theme
this brush has pretty firm bristles almost too firm  i am afraid sometimes that i might break the skin of more tender items like tomatoes although the ring is nice for grabbing it would be easier to use if the bristle area was straight
spirulina powder is kind of one of those trendy health supplements right now so im not surprised by the price especially for an organic producteasy to add into green smoothies and such if you dont put a crazy amount the flavor is pretty easily hidden not bad
i used to drink those ice smoothies at target as a kid taste brings back memories quality is decent for getting a pump
baggy didnt fit properly middle finger was tiny which is your longest finger  sent back
it didnt really help keep my glasses up and wore off after a short while  it may work for people with different shaped noses i think glasses have a harder time staying on mine
very impressed with this item well worth the price
best product on the market for cleaning  i am so glad i discovered these  i use them to clean my tile floor bathtub refrigerator counter tops etc  they clean so well you dont really need to use much cleaning solution if you havent tried these you should
i used it as a roller
i bought a package of two because i was trying to approximate the facia blaster not available on amazon at this time and hoped this would work just as well  probably would have been workable except for two things the octopus top has a face and the nose part of the face is pokey when youre grabbing the top and trying to 34blast34 your facia with it  also i had only been working for about 5 minutes when the top of the first one unscrewed and when i tried to screw it back on again these are two piece massagers that you screw the top handle part onto the bottom fingers part it was stripped and would just spin in a circle and come off again  couldnt be secured in place  if this were a solid single piece construction and a smooth knob for the top it would have been a great option for facia blasting  i think ill just end up buying the actual facia blasterupdate  i had been giving up trying to approximate the facia blaster and was about to buy the product but i had been hearing from youtube reviews that it was taking a long time to arrive and i didnt want to stop efforts to blast while waiting waiting waiting  i found a diy facia blaster online and decided to make one and these little guys are just the ticket  hooray  heres a link to the diy project tutorialhttpwwwwellnessgeekycomhomemadefasciablasteralternativediy
i use these every christmas i used to have a whole bunch of holders and i cant find them was happy to find a kit with 2 holders and 5 scenters a little pricey for my taste but the scent has held up pretty well normally they last about 34 days and then your nose gets used to it
i liked the aroma while opening the box of shower steamers but in the shower they gave a light scent i could smell it in the shower but wish it was a little stronger of a scent i did like the scent so it was pleasantupdate i wanted to update my review a s state that depending on the scent you may have more pleasant aromas  i used another scent out of the pack and it smelled great and had my bathroom smelling like it i think some scents are lighter than others
worked out as exspected
i have reordered many times fast shipping and comfortable
i cant imagine putting this in my eyes even if it was diluted felt like pure cayenne pepper in my mouth
wow i can tell my hair and nails are growing out thicker and stronger and ive only been using this for about 2 weeks it might take you a while to take these if you have trouble taking pills because the serving size is 6 pills i can take 10 pills at once so its no issue for me i understand that this supplement is made from whole foods so it makes sense the serving size is more that one pill you want to make sure it works and it does
i got these to replace the pad on my libman spray mop and these work great they fit well on the head and are secure on the unit the best thing is when these get dirty i have a replacement while the other is being washed
good quality flights and good thickness  wife wanted them and she really likes the way they look
they work for the price cant beat them
creatine monohydrate is the most affordable form of creatine this is also micronized creatine so it dissolves better this dissolves almost instantly in water  i stir it a bit with a spoon the taste of this creatine is almost completely neutral so it blends into any drink the recommendation is to stir this into water non acidic juice or a carbohydrate drink the benefits of drinking creatine is that it helps you increase your energy so you can have more strength and endurance when lifting weightsthe rebecca review
got them for both of my girls and they love it
i think the use of noise cancelling is a little lost in translation but otherwise these were great and came in really handy  when i travel and am in a secured place its nice to be able to block out all the noise and get some good rest  these did an excellent job  i also used them when going to the shooting range and they worked great there also  having the different sizes meant i had an extra pair to give to someone that didnt have proper ear protection at the range the hard carrying case is great to have as well or i wouldve lost them a long time agoto be noise cancelling they would have to produce a counter noise so the use of that term is incorrect but they do block out a good amount of sound  i was very happy with them and had no problems with them at all
i am highly disappointed i have never taken hair growth vitamins but since doing the bc not once but twice in the last 4 years of going natural i did extensive research looking for hair growth vitamins that contained everyrhing i would need for healthy hair i heard great things about hairfinity but decided dasgro had everything my hair needs to grownow let me say this i love the product and wanted to wait till i was done with my second bottle before leaving a reviewreason for the 2 starsi never received my second bottle yet everyday im receiving text messages from the carrier  will be delivered today i had yet received it and when it comes to any type of supplement i like to stay consistent sadly i had to spend more money and purchase hairfinity went to the beauty supply store  hopefully it works just as good as dasgro
pumpkin seed oil is a culinary specilty that is also often found in food supplements its a more readily available form of pumpkin seeds which are presumed to treat bladder irritation kidney infections intestinal worms and trouble urinating due to benign prostatic hyperplasia bph my dad is in his 60s has started to develop prostate difficultiesi advised for him to take pumpkin seed oil capsules and he says that urination is much easier and clinically there are no concerns from his doctor
i think the frequency works for all pests i dont hear sny more scratching near the attic above my bed but i rarely used the night light and it turns on and then immediately off i have bought 3 and it all does that so glad that the unit itself still works perhaps an led bulb for longetivity
works just fine for me clear instructions plenty of refills comes with several preset so you dont have to immediately place the filters in the frames
yum  smells really good  very subtle
i use these in my halo mask they are comfy i can breathe
this big set of shoe inserts has everything you need to make any shoe comfortable  it is very handy
perfect for whay ive used it for  i thought i had kidney stones  worked well
i often find myself using my less accurate notouch forehead thermometer to avoid dealing with the sterilization process following the use of an oral thermometer these digital thermometer sleeves work great and about the only issue i have encountered was removing it from its protective packaging without dealing with extra pieces of plastic
theres not much to describe it is a simple product and i received exactly what i wanted
i mean yeah it makes it convenient it is a complete mineral profile i like that about it but sadly it uses inferior forms of some minerals they used calcium carbonate which is one of the most poorly absorbed calciums citrate is what you want as well as magnesium oxide which is also poorly absorbed  you want malate or gycinate that made me a bit disappointed in this product its not too hard to swallow and goes down easy but in the endits not the best
extra fluffy when new and dry but not so much once wet not as good as the original mop heads but still good for the money
it does what is says it will do removes hair painlessly  it does take significant amount of time rubbing it in a circular motion to remove the hair but it does eventually remove the hair and it does not hurt at all unlike waxing or using an epilator  your skin is exfoliated in the process so it is really smooth afterwards  i was able to do one half of my leg from the knee down on the front before my arm got too tired so i will do a little each day after my shower until it is all donebonus it also works on facial hair that i normally get a wax treatment for  i was looking at my lady lip hairs and it reminded me that i need to make an appointment for a wax treatment then saw this device sitting on the bathroom counter and had a lightbulb momentwould this work on my little bit of random lip hair  i had just washed my face so i gave it a try and it worked  again the exfoliation left my skin feeling smooth and soft and no little hairs needing to either be plucked or waxed  because of this along i have upgraded it from 4 stars to 5 stars now i dont need to schedule a wax appointment and have my upper lip swollen and red all day after the waxing like it usually is  i had no irritation at all from this device  saying goodbye to my every couple of weeks painful waxing appointmentsi had my doubts that it would work or if it did remove the hair it would have my sensitive skin very irritated but i was wrong on both parts  it worked and my skin was not harmed at all  kind of a cool device and cost less than a single waxing appointment too
i really cant believe how good this fish oil tastes  im not sure how they get it to taste this great im just glad they do
shipping took a bit longer than expected good price and value
have a hole in your tooth from a crown falling out it works
this my second brush i purchased but this brush takes too long to heat up and i had the temp on 450
this is a huge urinal for women nothing discreet about this thing i am not going to take it with me at all  i would rather go in the great outdoors instead
not much to say other than these were the size and color i needed
needs smoothed hole edges but i can do that easily myself in a few minutes
these glasses seem to be a wireeh style  they can get easily crushed in man pockets  so im not sure  the frame is too lightweight and lacks the comfort at the ear piece and nose piece  i wanted wider fitting for my big head  so these were good for that purpose  yet when they are on and i am looking thru the glasses i can see the glass frame edges all the time  i since bought another style glasses  and now use these as spares around the house yes they fit around my big head nicely no the lenses are smaller than comfort nose piece is flimsy entire glass frame is flimsy
this raveler sleep mask for woman and man contoured with ear plugs is good at blocking out light but lets some light in at the nose area  this is because the nose area is preshaped like the nose area in a halloween eye mask so that the sleep mask doesnt lie completely flat against the nosesleep masks designed with padded fabric across the lower edge of the mask below the eyes and across the nose do a more complete job of blocking out light see eg   however this sleep mask which comes with a set of rubber ear plugs gives good value for the price less than 6 on amazon  it also has a very wide and comfortable elastic band for holding the mask in place while you sleep
the band i received from withit was the molded style not decal and is amazing  i get tons of compliments on it  it fits my pebble time perfectly  the colors are exactly as pictured  it matches pretty much everything  highly recommend
pros great size good temp control 7 levels very softcon only one you can feel the heat wires when you hold it if youre laying on it you cant tell
i am completely new to gua sha techniques so i thought this roller set would be a good entry point and for the most part it is if you are looking for a set that will allow you to learn the techniques at a good and reasonable price point then try these and upgrade to stainless or real jade at some point in the futuremy big gripe about these is that they do feel a little cheap i am not entirely sure that it is real jade and when the roller arrived the larger roller was popped out of place and i had to pop it back in there but it feels really really insecure in there now if the packaging was better this might not have happened thats okay though because i really just wanted the handsculpting too so i can live with the roller not being great if you are buying this for the roller i would look elsewhere otherwise i would recommend this set as a beginnerentry level piece
great for bugbites and muscle painsspasmsevery home medicine cabinet should have in stock
perfect for summer outdoor parties and weddings
delivers the needed calories with a great chocolate taste
i was looking forward to getting this product for review i received a discount because ive had tinnitus for nearly 25 years because ive lived with it for so long im not surprised that this supplement wasnt effective in my case in fact i wouldve been shocked if it had beeni will continue talking these and i will update my review if i notice a difference
this item is not as good as advertised i read the research paper the product is based on and the statistics looked decent but i am not one of the people this product worked a miracle on i am back to the old acid blockers this product is worth a try but after one bottle if you feel no improvement do not waste your money on another one
i love this set  definitely will be purchasing more in the future this set has everything you need to smooth  shape the nails i highly recommend
collagen is a part of my daily routine usually in coffee since coffee is part of my daily routineeach packet has 35 calories and 9 g of protein all from cow collagen peptidesunflavored so nothing to interfere or overly sweetenpricier than similar collagens and the serving size is larger than some others as wellstill these are convenient packets for on the go the packets are thoughtfully designed very easy to open no scissors needed
this saved me money compared to the disposable pads that the pups like to tear apart
taste went away almost immediately everyone i shared it with said the same exact thing im not sure if stevia gum can be done but this product certainly hasnt cracked the code yet
ive used a few tens units in the past and can state that this might be the most powerful one ive used though this power comes at the cost a shorter battery life it worked for about 30 minutes out of the box though and when fully charged i got a few hoursthis tens unit charges fairly quickly and provides muscle tensionpain relief so i definitely recommend this devicejust a reminder though that there are warnings online to not place the pads near your heart so id advise not using it on your torso or spinal cord
im using these along with a scooter while i recover from a broken ankle  i have arthritis in my shoulders so i this style of crutch works better for me balancing the pressure better for me  these are reasonably priced but still good quality
i will keep them because i could can cut a piece of soft fabric moleskin  to line with first but in my opinion this cushion is worse on the sores than the furniture it is protecting against  it is not a soft gel cushion  its more like the scratchy styrofoam peanuts used in packaging  but thicker maybe i can find a gel pad to line it with i have it two stars because i like the netted sleeve  for az heat that is ideal so it has some value to me and  not worth returning but not soft enough to use for bed sores thats for sure
its a bit of a mess of cords and such but it makes the flight box wonderful to use compared to batteries i dont even use the batteries any more unless im mobile very nice using it lightly for 3 months no problems or breaks so far
this is a great battery it works exactly as you would expect it to so far it has provided us with a long life and it works great im very happy with it
i have always liked the cleaning job mr clean erasers did but i hated the thin pads that wore away quickly and shredded these pads are amazing they dont shred into small pieces  and they scrub hard  dried messes love them for baseboard cleaning and quick wipe downs of nasty messes
i like the oval shape its good for working in between the scapula and spine
i am really pleased that this product came up on my list of items i can review when i saw it i instantly selected it because i know that chlorella is an excellent green superfood i love superfoods and consume them often this one is just chlorella with no spirulina added but if you want both in a capsule its easy to find here on amazon if its only chlorella youre interested in this is a great way to take it i like both the powdered and capsule forms i like the powder for my smoothies but sometimes i dont want a smoothie and the capsules are a great alternative i always feel better and more energized when i consume green superfoods they have a lot of nutrition and naturally occurring minerals there is nothing negative i can find to say about this product
i really love these sponges i hope they never stop making them
soft comfortable and stays warm when heated  highly recommended
these are helpful and dont rub off i forget they are on
fractionated coconut oil is good for making homemade soaps and beauty products but its less potent for hair and body care use  i find the formula thinner but the trade off is that it isnt as greasy and you can still use it for moisturizing your hair and skin without that greasy coconut oil feeling which stains too i have both kinds of oil  the real unprocessed kind for massaging into my hair hands and nails and this kind which is versatile but lacks the smell of coconut but is good as a carrier oil both have their uses and this product is of decent quality  i would just go by price because i dont see any discernible difference between this one and other similarly priced brands of fractionated oil
works wellstays closed
this product is very thin if you are looking for something thin this is the way to go
great scissors but a little small for a mans hands hey who said nurse means womans size
smells better than bonce
my only complaint with these molds is the size two millimeters is too small for an effective dose  the 2 trays should come in a 5ml  10ml size other than that these are spoton id never made suppositories before  was afraid the caps on the bottom would be hard to remove from the directions they came with but the caps pull off easily no twisting needed the pipettes make it easy to fill the molds without any overflow use the pipettes once then toss them and the individual molds  caps are easy to clean with a qtip dipped in alcohol definitely store your supps in the fridge once you make them  stick them in the freezer for 10 min right before using them to prolong the melting time this kit costs more than a 10pk of natural plantbased supps that youll find online but it lets you make as many as you need based on whatever formula suits your ailment good stuff
no more problems with hats being a little too tight fixed 3 ball caps so far love it
love this little thing  i had a moldy smell in my bathroom  getting ready to renovate but until then bought this to help with smell and toxins  after about 3 days the smell was completely gone  amazing  quiet little fan which is not annoying
couldnt be happier with this purchase  colonics have literally saved my life i was diagnosed with a pelvic floor dysfunction which led me to the inability to have a bowel movement on my own and that undoubtily  led to all sorts of problems health issues and diseases autoimmune lupus chronic fatigue epstein barr hypo thyroid hatchimotos sp fibermyelgia   prior to this i was extremely healthy  my career was in fitness but after years of major constipation at least 30 yrs my 34then34 healthy body couldnt fight off the toxins anymore  i became so toxic and sick  there were days i could hardly get out of bed but when i did  all i could think about was when i could lay back down and take a nap againim a mom of a young family  this unhealthiness was unacceptable buy i was clueless regarding what i could do about it  so i decided to doctor at the world famous mayo clinic with the best docs in the world  after months and months of tests the only thing they could come up with was to remove my colon and live with a colostomy bag the rest of my life  i was so depressed but didnt believe i had any other choice  right before my surgery my husband suggested i go see a naturalpathic doctor to see if they could help me in any way they chose to take me on as their most challenging constipated patient client  a big part of regaining my health was getting professional colonics do you know how expensive those things are between 60100  i was getting one a week for 18 months yes thats how impacted i was i knew this couldnt continue doing this as who can afford a lifestyle of this i sure couldnt on my income my extended family felt so badly for me they would gift me with a colonic a month just to help me out  when they could  but i was still paying thousands out of my own pocket to continue this major cleanse i needed  i thought id eventually have to just give in and use the 34bag34 as it was more 34affordable34  thats when i found out about this colonic board best info ive ever received  changed my life  i ordered it immediately it came in the mail that week and i set it up very simple and went right to work  during my first colonic while using it  i had tears in my eyes  it worked what an answer to prayer  no more having to pay for all those professional colonics  on a side note i just finished a radical 8day detox cleanse and using my colonic board daily was a big part of that   i now feel better than i have in years im not kidding  i lost my bloated weight ive got never ending energy my body nor my joints hurt anymore i cant wait to get out of bed in the mornings im happier  no longer depressed etc  i am forever grateful to my new colonic board that has given me back not only my health but my lifeps  just to warn you ive never met a western medical doctor who has approved of this practice so dont expect them to be jumping up and down on your newfound discovery with you but at the same time ive never met a doctor  nor any person who had as bad of a chronic constipation problem as i had
we have a big variety of probiotics that we rotate and use daily  this one has a very impressive label  now i have no way to test any of these claims so i just have to believe them  this one gives more capsules for less money than many others allthewhile giving lots of cfusnot long before the covid19 outbreak i had to take another round of antibiotics  since this wipes out all of the good bacteria in my intestines i stocked up on several different pre  probiotics  my thoughts are that different brands may have different types of good bacteriaafter about two weeks of some serious probiotic dosages which was also in the middle of the covid19 outbreak i got sick  i had a fever cough and shortness of breath  it really started to worry me  it only lasted two days and was gone  i have no proof but i am going to say that my pre and probiotics kept me from getting much sicker and also shortened the duration of my illness
this does wonders for its size my bf and i both have extremely bad allergies especially during season changes this helped us to get amazing sleep without stuffed noses ever since i got it it takes about a day to sanitize the air i have it in an 15x10 room also my guinea pigs were have allergy problems but after about a week of having this in my room the guinea pigs cage is in myroom their allergies cleared up and saved me from a huge pricey vet bill ill be buying another soon for my cat room
the brand seems to have changed names twice since ive been using it and the new packaging is the same bottle they have always used but now it is also placed in a sealed heavy plastic bagvery very wasteful and such a poor use of plastic for a company putting out organic items especially they already had a seal on the bottle and the cap is wrapped in a plastic band so the bag is truly wasteful also i believe the mg in each bottle has changed at least twicei believe 3 timesjust seems sketchy since it was not advertised to have changed i only knew by reading the package  that said it seems to work perfectly well i just may start looking for another brand that gives me more confidence and less waste
saw this on insta and immediately bought thru amazon primebetter  but it is terrible  poor qualitypoor instructions and flimsy cord for charging it took forever to heat up and i was terrified that it would tangle my hair i didnt have to worry because it would not wind fullyi returned and treated myself to a curling ironsometimes old school is still the best
excellent product for hair that wont lie flat  ive been using tancho tique for more than 50 years
this pill box is pretty big but it has to be to hold 31 days of medication  the daily  pill containers are not huge but the individual compartments will hold the six pills i take once a day and few pills two more times a day  the pill splitter is a nice addition also  my wife is traveling for a month and she was worried i wouldnt take the right medicine while she was gone  now she can fill this pill box up for a month  its just he right pill box for my situation  glad i found it on amazon i was going to buy several small pill boxes  the quality is good enough and should last a few years
got this for photo and video shoots where 34wardrobe malfunctions34 cant happen without requiring reshooting  the only thing that will hold outfits in place tighter and not take skin off is doublesided wig tape but it is tough to conceal the tape outline if the fabric is thin  this is in the middle of the spectrum between heavy duty 34stickum34 sprays and the wig tapefour stars instead of 5 because the applicator tip is less than ideal  this product used to come packaged like a 34glue stick34 which seemed to be less messy than the applicator tip that come on this one
seems good quality
comfortable and absorbent
strong motor easy to use
perfect very nice exactly what i expected great price
i have been taking 10000 mcg biotin supplements daily for many years to help with hair and nail health this vita mountain product has calcium in it as well and i am not sure why they added that ingredient as far as quality i have no reason to score this less than five stars for actual purchasing i would go with whatever is cheapest which is often natrol or nutricost i am unaware of any notable differences between the brands
this is useful and seems durable its replacing a similar cane i bought a year ago which bent but that was a different design for the leg and seemed less durable i hope this one will last i use a different cane in the summer but find it useful to have a light on the cane in the winter when i have to see ice and snow to walk the flashing red light is very useful for crossing the street at night the alarm might not seem like a great idea but lets be honest there are people who attack cripples and i ended up needing the alarm only 2 days after i got the cane when i was randomly attacked near my homei get a lot of compliments on it from people who are impressed with the idea of a cane with lights built in
this is one of the best cheap beauty tool that is on the market right now it is very affordable and within the budget it is a no frills device just place it in the refrigirator and it actually works it is alao portable and can be brought during travel what i love about this is that it also has a container which protects it from bacteria while in the ref it is very helpful in giving relief against sinus pressure also it instantly lifts and freshens up a tired face the only reason why i didnt give 5 stars is that i find it cost more than similar products in the market now recommending it though
very sturdy great price everyone at the wedding was jealous as they were all sinking in the mud
good quality sweet almond
in my house we have a sock monster who eats only one sock of every pair  then there is the mess monster  he leaves a mess that no one knows anything about  we also have another monster which has been frustrating me  the dustpan monster  this monster not only makes dustpans disappear for months at a time but when they come back they have bites out of them or corners missing  when i saw this i was ecstatic  lets take a lookwhat is this set likethis set comes in a box of parts  you have to put them together but the instructions are easy to follow and loaded with pictures for those who are visual learners  once the set is assembled you end up with a broom and a dustpan that clip together when not in usehow does this performi have to say many brooms have left me wanting more  this one however works just right  it is not the best broom i have ever used but it is definitely way better than many of them  the cleaning feature of the dustpan is fantastic  it really worksdoes the dustpan leave dirt on the floorif i press down the dustpan lightly i find that 95 of the dirt goes in the first time  i might have to press down with my foot for very fine dirt but for the most part it works welldoes the dustpan lockthe dustpan locks into place but it also is not hard to press down to use either  there is no release button it is pressure activatedis there a hole to hang this fromno there is not a hole to hang this from  you will have to use a clip broom hanger style to put this on the walldoes this stand upwhen this is put together and the dustpan is up the counterbalance of the broom causes this to stand up pretty wellthe bottom linei am very happy to have this set  i love the dustpan which seems to work quite well and also has the great cleaning feature for the broom bristles  it definitely does clean off pet fur and dustmy ratingfive stars  i love this set  i have looked for a long time for a set like this but the best part is that it stores well and stands up nicely too it is compact
bought this as an alternative to fresh wild blueberries to add to the medical mediums heavy metal detox smoothie
oh my gosh i love my foam roller i thought it might be too hard  dense at first but after a week of using it my body adjusted and my softer foam roller just isnt enough on most areas anymore im a massage therapist and i get tight everywhere i  use this to roll out my entire back neck upper arms forearms glutes legs  feet balancing on the roller  stretching that fascia on the bottom of the feet is great for plantar fasciitis i like to use it after a hot shower or hot tub soak so i am loosened up a bit it is so efficient that im able to spend less time on self carestretching than i used to hallelujah with the accompaniment of a couple tennis balls to get into the small spots thats all i need i use the smallest 12 size so i can transport it around with me to different offices but i finally just got a 2nd one so i can always have one at my main office as well as home when i realized how dependent i am on my foam roller i thought i really ought to write a review ive also seen reviews of other brands saying they fell apart and this one is super sturdy  ive been using it at least once a day for roughly 6 months and it looks and feels exactly the same as the brand new one that i just received i have a feeling it will probably last forever like really forever to the detriment of the environment uh anyway great product
love this pocket guide great information
my doctor says same deteriorates rapidly from humidity  he says must buy the kind in individual foil protection  too bad cause these are cheaper but this form too fragile he says

i trust garden of life products i love this one because their products are plant based
i like form  of these where i dont have to store big plastic bottle of detergent  they are easy enough to usefor normal dirty clothese these work fine  the scent is not too strong at least for my taste and my husbandshowever he worked in the yard putting up decorations and his clothes were a mix of sweat dirt and i dont even know what  i did use double dose and not all the dirt came out  most of it did but there were still a few spots where i can see dirt spots  my husband said its ok becasue they are his work clothes but for me i need my clothes clean really clean  the sweat smell came out nicely but i dont think this is strong enough for really tough deep dirty clothes we started using different things around the house to be eco friendly and this is a really nice way to add to that  i did have to wash a few things again and i did use my normal detergent and it came out fine
i love how many different sounds and intensities there arei personally love the rain  i just love the sound of rain  its soothing and really helps me relax to fall asleepso easy to use  i do like that it charges up using a usb cableon the nights when its just too chilly to turn on my fan i like that i can still have the sound of a fan running without the cold air blowinga great sound machine that can be used by anyone in the family
these are so pretty and exactly what i wanted
a bit more  than the average pill holder but it is worth it very sturdy clips on each compartment that should travel well easy to open nice spring action too a unique front facing design so you dont have to turn it around for night and day pills

this is a tasty vitamin drink with trace minerals ive been using it for 2 months and havent noticed anything amazing but i do feel good about getting my nutrients what i dont feel good about is every time i look it up to buy another canister the price is higher i wont be buying more until the price gets back to just over reasonable as the first 2 were to me 43 and 44 are a bit high but my friend wanted me to try it now its 6150 just 3 weeks later up 30 no im not going for it

i bought this for my son who is on the autism spectrum  i was concerned that he wasnt getting is teeth completely clean everywhere  unfortunately  this doesnt really work  it barely moves and feels awkward  i feel like it was a huge waste of money
easy to apply after bathing without spilling  this is nice product without being too greasy  fine mist will do the trick without pouring it in your hand and possibility of spilling
i cant notice any difference at all except for the strong odor it leaves my shower has white tile that turns a little yellow if not cleaned this product does no difference at all except on the yellow stuff the only difference it will make to your life is the waste of money and the waste of time spraying after each time you take a shower
as school starts and cold season approaches its time for immunity building my spouse served me the drink and i asked if they added seltzer because it was so effervescent which i like but it was just from the tablet dissolving in water my kids begged to taste it because it looks like lemonade and they really liked the flavor i was surprised it didnt taste too bad to me either slightly lemony with three kids in school heres hoping for less sickness this season

when i first opened the container of gummies i was expecting to smell something light and citrusy instead i was met with a very strong odor that smells like a combination of plastic and cleaning supplies its quite strong despite the rather scary aroma i tried one anyway and they are quite delicious im just a bit put off by the smell
i love to take a nice weekend nap but our house gets a surprising amount of sunlight also when taking a day nap my eyelashes end up all squashed and wonky with no time to try and tame them back to unsmooshed length and curlthese silk sleep masks solve both of those major nap issues they keep the light out while being oh so comfortable to wear i dont notice them they are light not too tight and dont shift the silk also keeps my lashes from squishing they just glide over the silkso comfortable so nice looking and feeling i feel like a 50s screen star im just a glamorous napper
the first bag i ordered was bright orange and felt and worked great as a natural vitamin c the second and third bag i ordered were brown in color with a very different taste and smell not consistent and really disappointed in the quality control also the color of powder does not match color in product imagebut i love terrasoul products so i will buy their camu camu powder nstead which is supposed to have 3x more vitamin c then acerola cherry
i have very small eyes so i havent been able to find an eyelash curler that works for me i had very high hopes for this product but it doesnt curl my lashes at all and the first time i used it i used it too long and my eyes puffed up from the heat i guess i actually burned my eye lid it also says to use after applying mascara in the directions but when i tried this my mascara came off like i said i really wanted this product to work for me but it just didnt
unfortunately these didnt work and i returned them first if you have a larger roll of paper theyre not large enough to fit around the rollsecond the cutter wrinkles and tears the paper instead of delivering a clean cut
all of dr axe products are reliable  these work  period
the gloves are soft wash up nicely serve the purpose of hand lotion treatment at night very well they come in small boxes making it easy to pack and take with thanks
been using this since our baby was a newborn although i know this company was under some scrutiny a while ago i still think this is a great product we havent really had much diaper rashes but when we did this took care of it its a thicker consistently when the tube is new but over time it can become more liquidy especially in warmer temperatures and it turns to like an oil so best to keep in a cooler place also sometimes when the tube gets really old and low there are some grainy things im not sure if thats because the product has dried out a bit overall i think this is a good diaper rash ointment or preventative ointment it also goes on clear so you babys butt isnt covered in like white
great product it is sturdy and just high enough for me i love the handle as i have poor balance the person that said to step on it before you depend on the handle is correct i am happy i bought this
really cool product no complaints i love the style too
great product speedy delivery would rest again
use this for nail art
this is such a great scale it is very light weight and the numbers are easy to read
i tried first day super cute and really comfortable
i use this product for keeps drain traps filled in the science lab the extra heavy formula helps it stay in place and fill the large space in the pipe
good quality hair support
this product is amazing we moved into a home that has some funky smells going on in it i opened this up in the bedroom and since then i havent smelled anything bad on my whole upper floor every now and again i catch a clean scent but for the most part it just smells like nothing the absence of an odor which is just what i was hoping for
nice unit  except the bracket is too narrow to hold waterpic and similar showerheads which renders it useless for metoo bad really that the distributor and manufacturer dont take the time to let potential purchasers know this because they refuse to take returns on this itemtoo bad really because the unit is otherwise acceptable the suction cup adheres well and the bracket allows a fair range of adjustment gfor the showerhead  if you have one that fits the bracketjerry
i am very happy with this supplement i have purchased from this company before and have never had issues magnesium is great to help with muscle soreness

seems silly to write a review for a sleep mask but this one is worth it  and i feel obligated to share it with ya all who are shopping for one  i have been a sleepmask addict for 10 years thats what having a child can do to you evidently i literally cannot fall asleep without one this 34earth therapeutics34 is the one and only for me but i have 5 of them ha ha sleep masks are either too slippery dont stay on too transparent not enough coverage too uncomfortablethick too much coverage or too small or too big or not adjustable around my head to fit right its neat that it has a soft side i love during cooler weather and a satin side great for warmer weather its the perfect size  not too little but not too big i dont like to notice the sleep mask it has to feel natural i tried the memoryfoam type ones and ones that seem sort of molded for 34comfort34 and they were awful whats more  they last they last through washes the velcro and elastic are not 34cheap34 they are strong and stay solid i have had the same mask my first one a pink one which was a gift for over 5 years and its still going strong i have 5 of them just to rotate and keep them washed to keep my skin clean at night i cant even recommend a runnerup  this is the endall beallps if you try the masks with the headphones so you can listen to tunes as you fall asleep i just want to say how disappointed i was i couldnt find a good comfortable mask with builtin headphones so when i want music at night i just use headphones separately let me know if you find a great earth therapeutics lightweight sleep mask with built in headphones that dont add bulk and annoyance ha ha
it works
these are very poorly made and thin material would not stay up and do nothing to help with knee pain
normally i just love gummy vitamins but these dont taste very good  i like the vitamins and omega3s they contain all that is very good  they just dont taste good  i immediately get a fishy flavor got to be from the algae they are made from followed by some serious tartness  though they are still palatable why consume these when there are other gummy vitamins that are just as good and taste a lot better  if you dont mind tartness and a little fishy flavor then i highly recommend these
looks like this hibiscus powder is new on the market and i decided to give it a try it shipped quickly and was packaged well i found it to be of a very good quality it has a nice intense color and smells like freshly ground this is a true superfood with tons of good benefits it works great on my hair and i also like adding it to my morning smoothies and teas definitely i would recommend it

this is a great product i have tried several different straightening devices to straighten my beard this one is the best one definitely worth the money it heats up quickly and if you forget to turn it off they even have a automatic shutoff
had to throw them away because they smelled like smoke so bad the box was yellow but unopened
pretty nice device and my face felt relaxed after the massage took me a minute to figure out of to use this device but after the learning phase went into action got my face muscle to relax and did a bit in the neck also take a while to get used to this device but is worth it good quality and came in a nice box
i  tried to remove the balls off of a sweater and a tshirt it damaged the sweater so bad i had to buy my son a new one its like running piece of metal with jagged teeth on your clothes
this shiatsu neck and back massager has 4 massage nods help get a nice deep muscle massage and an added heat option to help blood circulation  it has a car charger that allows you to operate it in your car and a strap to secure it  this comes with a massager pillow power cord car adapter and  easy to understand directionsi have a lot of back and neck pain and boy does this help it  it just massaged the tightness and pain from them  it has strong powerful rollers and a one minute timer which switches directions of the rollers after a minutethis is not cordless you must be near an outlet to use thisi received this neck and back massager to use review and to give my honest opinion about it
in short open reservoir cup makes it easy to add water keep clean and to allow dry between uses can adjust strength slim design makes it easy to maneuver around mouth takes up little room can be packed up for on the go use loud but similar to my corded tank stylei use water flossers all the time the best to me is a particular name brand that has a tank and is plugged in i keep that in my main bathroom that has a plug nearby since i rely greatly on water flossing i wanted to have one in my 1st floor bathroom which is like the size of a closet and has no counter and no plugs so i have been tried cordless flossers for use in that bathroomhere is the thing i find with most of them the water reservoirs are bulky and are hard to clean i dont care that they dont hold much water that is easy enough to deal with but to have an enclosed cup that really can ever be cleaned out gross then i tried one where there  and that works really well for my needs that one wins out over this due to one aspect it is fully cordless when i saw this hangsun water flosser i decided to try itit has appearance of regular plug in but an open water top that makes me feel better about it drying between uses i didnt need another flosser but i wanted to find out more about it and report back in a reviewso this may be for you if you are like me in wanting a cordless flosser with an open water reservoir i can easily add more water to it it is easy to clean and it dries between uses charge has been long lasting so i like that i dont need to fuss it is nice for use in noplug areas while cordless i still feel attached as i need to set the base down doubt i would use this in shower with my other one i may need to supply my own cup for water but it can be any size and i can use it in shower just by cupping my handkinda loud similar to my plug in name brand onei tend to only ever use one head the slightly curved one havent tried the other options and likely wontof the half dozen cordless flossers i have tried including a name brand cordless i like this one and the one i linked to the best i use them secondary to my plug in
im a big fan of mint and a big fan of chocolate  many see girl scout thin mints as the apex of chocolatemint cookiedom but i was looking for something more  i think ive found it in these york peppermint pattie cookies  the cookies consist of a chocolate cookie covered with mint creme and dipped in chocolate  heres whats so great about them  first these cookies are dipped in dark chocolate which i personally prefer to milk chocolate  second they have a nice layer of mint creme which gives a nice texture compliment to the crunchy cookie  third the mint creme is a true strong peppermint great for those who love their mint  overall this is a great cookie  id happily munch one anytime

i used to love this alpiste milk but for some reason they added guar gum and now its too thick i liked the previous one it was a much lighter version so much better i hope they can bring it backfor those who do enjoy thicker milks this is great for liver cleanse loosing and keeping extra weight off
im so glad i got these they last just as long as the original battery and its invaluable to have extra batteries when youre places without electricity such as camping trips if you have the camera its worth the few bucks to get the extra batteries i got an exceptional price
received the device a couple of days ago  stumbled around a little bit to get the hang of it but its easy when you know what you are doing  purchased this one because of the many positive reviews  good choice  im just wearing it now to see how i do normally  i cant believe i am such a low stepper  no wonder ive seen a weight gain  darn the reality of sitting at a computer all day  when you can 34see34 for yourself what you are doing or more importantly not doing it really is a motivator  grandma was slow but she was old  i hope to reverse some of that old saying
i got this free at cvs using extra bucks but that price still seems too high mine had no mechanical problems and the vibrations were pretty strong it shook the entire table which makes me wonder if it should be containing that vibration and channeling it into the jewelry more efficiently its important to note that the cvs price was only 799 and i got it half off after christmas for basically four bucks i tried it first with just warm water no change my jewelry still had some grime then tried with a drop of dawn same result the photo in my review is after two cycles the debris in the lid is from dropping it while trying to open it that wasnt actually removed by the device i also experienced difficulty removing the lid but i was able to get it apart with just my hands save your money dont get it
i cannot tell if its picking up anything dirt is still there after spraying and wiping it smells great though

i was hoping this was the original formula but it is not i used this detergent with my last 2 kids so i know the smell of it and this one is not the same i loved the old smell which last longer on the clothes after washing this one fades away i can barely smell it after the clothes come out of the washer also the original formula is much more concentrated therefore you only need to use a little bit i used more with this one as for packaging it arrived well packaged in plastic so there was no leak
works exactly as advertised zero smoke  not sure how long it lasts but out of the package id call it a miracle product  surprise bonus was the smoke buddy keychain great entertainment posing him after using the smoke buddy
when i decided to order them i must have misread the directions  once i received them i discovered that the daily amount is three  that  means a package is a twenty day supply  to me that is too expensive and the taste really isnt that great  i didnt take them long enough to determine how helpful they will be
wow these are amazing
i bought this as a replacement to my original strap and it works great
works well in dishwasher and leaves dishes and glassware clean and sparkly have used this product for years
i purchased this scale on april 10 2016 today is may 16 2017 and my scale no longer works i changed the batteries when they died and now when you stand on the scale it says scanning step off thinking and then err like many others i reset the scale reset it up left batteries out etc i sought out the help page on fitbit 5 pages of people with the same problem no response from fitbit i am very angry that my 13 month old 123 scale no longer works i just bought a 17 digital scale to replace this bad show fitbit6117 update fitbit reached out to me and sent me a replacement scale no charge after we tried a few things to reboot my original scale their customer service has been fantastic and was wonderful to work with i really appreciate the good faith and of course the new scale i will gladly purchase their products again
i received this set undamaged and in good working order i tried the different heads included and have to say that it definitely works as intended you are using electricity so please follow all safety guidelines and do not use it for things it was not intended much like a tens unit this unit sends current into the skin at its lowest settings you merely feel a slight pleasant vibration i lack the courage to try it at its highest setting because it would surely give a pretty significant jolt in between those extremes there are several settings that create a good working base for a variety of uses for instance it gives instructions on aging or delicate skin when applying serums and when trying to alleviate painthe booklet is pretty clear on its warnings suggestions and instructions the box it came in has a magnetic closure dense foam to cradle the different fragile glass heads and the unit itself it will take some experimentation with to find the optimum level of comfort and efficacy
butter no pecan blcch
its not bad i havent felt any results as others have so i am going on faith that it will deliver benefits over time you must mix it with berries or something the taste by itself is a little rustic for me i make it as a keto smoothie with some heavy whipping cream fruit water a touch of stevia doable
its much thinner than i was hoping for but should do the trick if i double or triple layer it  but that will only make the usable length 13 what is listed
just as shown and just as stated the suction cups could be better but the price was right
i like how this makes me feel  great stuff
was having good success with bulletproof stress gummies but they contained malitol so i started looking for a viable substitute  this brand seemed pretty close  same sensoril ashwagandha just more same ltheanine a little more b6 plus the addition of gaba and magnesiumi find this blend helps with anxiety that started for me with perimenopause  the kind of irrational anxiety that you know is just anxiety  the sudden dwelling on all things bad  stressful the sense of impending doom  this blend helps a lot with that  i also find it useful as my brains leans toward overstimulation  i probably would have been labeled autistic as a 70s child had it been a thing  my brain does not shift gears well  it is not good at surprises  although i cope and try to be rational when hubs asks me to do something suddenly my brain just wont let me sometimes  i call it my gears jamming  this supplement helps that  it backs my brain down of the ledge and makes me think reasonably againoverall  super pleased with these  they are just what i was looking for
this is really great stuff  it is natural  it works  i learned about it years ago when i was going to fly  now i fly more often and am in a car traveling on all kinds of roads and in mountains at times and it is just really wonderful to help keep motion sickness away  it even works on ships as well  his is really a wonderful find  it is simple nothing i have to wear like a wrist thing not a pill where i could have side effects just simply an oil i put behind my ears  i make sure i am always stocked up on this wonderful stuff  i suggest it to anyone who may have a need
you cant expect quality products if its super cheap especially organic acerola i take the acerola tabs but sometimes i rather just mix it in my drinks this is very tart so i recommend mixing it with juice and also using a whisk it can clump very easily it really does give me energy im very sensitive to caffeine so this is a great alternative to energy drinks doesnt mess with my glucose levels and i dont crash on this the benefits of acerola are amazing and i recall hardly getting sick living in puerto rico because we had a large acerola tree in our back yard my mom use to juice them and we ate them as a family on a daily basis miss that tree
my son has chafing issues and this fixed his problem desitin is very messy but this stuff dries and helps the skin glide when rubbing together he hasnt had pain ever since i bought this
this review is more to clarify someone elses review bc they didnt understand understand the labeling  it shows 1000mg as advertised  another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium  i realize not everyone takes chemistry but 4 ppl liked his review  so misinformation is spreading  this works if however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr  ask for a medication called linzess which works must better  must faster but is unnecessary for most people  if magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food  drink 68 glasses of water per day  staying hydrated will really help  before switching to linzess i used to take one 1000 mg pill am  pm every day with meals  always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid
i really like these they are similar to other brands but cheaper and i feel like they work better than other brandsthey are somewhat hard to remove but thats with any brand i did notice a whiter smile
these work okay i used them twice and they are a bit awkward at first but you have to wear a long sleeve tee or other type of sweater otherwise they are noticeable take a little while to get used to but after a few minutes they prove to be comfortable
awesome heavy very good quality its so nice to have something to use for all my oils should probably get another one soon
love this mask  fits well without any gaps
i was nervous ordering these but they came perfect for my items i sell the color is accurate and bags are not to thin great for lip gloss
very uncomfortable
these little brooms are awesome work better than any ive ever purchased the price is also great as you get two sets i love mine
remote control worked great
not recommended
i had a brick hearth under an old wood burner removed the wood burner and installed a propane stove several bricks and the mortar in some areas were a mess i liked the old brick but had to do a bunch of repairs then grind off the excess mortar and some high spots in the brick the result was some brick looked brand new some mortar was pale and newly ground down the whole thing looked really rough i used less than 13 of the bottle applied with a cheap paint brush it now looks like the whole thing was nicely done 25 or more years ago i cant believe how well this stuff works the real test of its look is momma loves it
i use files to file my 4 month olds nails instead of clipping them and i absolutely love glass files the best they stand up to the test of time and are so nice and solid very thankful to have found these
this is my favorite tissue  i suffer from allergies and when the season is at its worst i need this tissue to keep me from getting a sore nose  this is a wonderful tissue
mybat is once again perfect for my new phone3 phones in 5 years the phone cover is 13 of the price at the phone seller placethis is my second mybat phone cover and perfecto again  see you again in two years i hopemore  ok  the cover flips over the phone and the inside has 3 sections to drop a credit card  or a pic of your pet armadillo
i mixed a heaping scoopful in some cold filtered water and it took some stirring but finally seemed to dissolve  it turned the water a beautiful cherry red but it did not taste like cherries  it tastes a lot like beets since beets are the primary ingredient and i could detect the flavor of the soil they were grown in  ive grown organic beets in my raised beds and i never could get the dirt taste completely out of them so im not complaining  as far as sweetness goes there was very little despite it being sweetened with stevia  i will be putting this into my smoothies and kefir smoothies from now on since its flavor is not all that good but the ingredients are top notch
loved this pattern  washed and used it and no issues worked as intended
these work great for me i have tried so many i wont buy anything else ever again
this is significantly better than any recorded white noise that ive ever found  this product actually pushes air instead of just playing a recorded noise and it works perfectly for someone who needs noise to studyworksleepetcif you are looking for your sound machine to multitask ie also be an alarm clock this is not for you but i would purchase this and an additional alarm clock because its that good
great scent you only need 12 drops of oil for a strong scent
i really loved this product by far the best one ive owned it looked great with my mascara i could not be happier with it
i find my focus increased and my energy way up when i take 2 capsules i appreciate that the ingredients are listed with amounts rather than a proprietary blend of ingredientsim a huge fan i also noticed my appetite greatly reduced
it helps take some pressure off my backthe only reason why i have 3 stars is because i cant sit with this belt for more than 15 or it starts to give me cramps and allot of pressure on my stomach so everytime you sit down you have to take it off thats the only bad thing
these really arent too shabby the cleaning sheets are as expectedi read through the product description before ordering  i think i have used something similar in the past as it felt rather intuitive to use just add a sheet to water it instantly dissolves i think 1 sheet per gallon give or take can be stuffed into a cleaning bottle for a spray solution or can be added to a bucket smells nice works well small pressure zip plastic packaging little footprint really no wastei have used it primarily on counter tops and tubs while it mentions floors and walls i just use it as a basic cleanerseems gentle enough my rag picks up a lot of dirt so i know it is effective current price of 5 for 30 sheets makes this a budget friendly option especially if looking for something that doesnt take up much space or plan to use it in a spray bottle of course there are liquid concentrates that would offer same but hey i thought it worth pointing outi really think it is an ok productlack of directions is a concern though i dont mind information in another language other than english if i cant figure it out then using a translator app i pass my phone over it  odd thing is there arent any instructions the most info you get on this product is what you see here on the product page there is no workable information printed on the package so i dont down rate because of the info not being in english i down rate because there simply is no info i will include a picture of the translated text but even so i think nearly anyone couldshould be able to figure this product outwatersoluble cleaning sheet concentrated cleaning sheet will quickly dissolves upon contact with water and is immediately ready for your cleanup jobi do  like these cleaning sheets i clean homes for a living and while i dont always need my own cleaners i do keep a few in my tool kit having the option of mixing something up on the go and having no added weight or mess to carry around is highly appealing  i would even tear off half a sheet and add it directly to a toilet it does dissolve instantly easily and smells good and fresh not too strong no need to rinselovely product overall 4 stars
bought as a gift for my husband he loves them
my elderly disabled mother 5 225 lbs  has no issues using this  it is sturdy and very helpful for her getting in and out of her bed
this is a nice ice roller it rollsspins without effort and doesnt stick even when very cold compared to another i have this handle is easier to hold as its made for a normal grip i have another one where the handle is somewhat triangle shaped the freezer case is especially nice as you can store it without worry of food contact it doesnt take up much room in the freezer i recommend this model
got this for my husband so he can have his meds really for the month and he likes this makes it so much nicer than doing them by the week  hes happy  and it works so well and with the little compartments being able to come out to take your pills that is nice as well  you dont have to mess with trying to get your pills out by holding the whole thing
i purchased this for my husband as he was looking to try a new creatine hes been taking it daily and has so far seen some pretty decent results the taste is good dissolves fairly well in water which often times is a challenge with creatine in general overall its a little early to really tell how well this is working out but it seems to be just fine ill update the review with more info once more time has passed from taking it
i have ibs it sucks being regular is apparently more important that i thought it would be wtf right anyway i take fiber gummies because of this theyre yummy dont leave them in the sun though its gummy it will melt
bought for older relative who was having issues with mouth sores
works like its supposed to
i love them nicer than the black ones  been using them for more then 3 years
this sleep mask is one of the most adorable ones ive ever seen it has a 3d effect because the floppy ears are attached separately to the mask and jut out its really cute and would be appreciated by dog lovers as well as fans of the disney movie the price is a little high for this type of thing but otherwise its a fun sleep mask especially for children now if only they made a cat version based on the aristocats
we wanted a first aid bag that we could fill for our dog its roomy and just what we needed
this freshcap unwind instant drink mix tastes very good  its slightly sweet and no where near being too sweet  some people may want to add a little more sweetener to it  i mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it completely dissolved leaving no mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup  it nearly has the color of coffee and when i added a little cream to it it looked exactly like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but without the caffeine  the product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix i guess that means reishi and chaga but it doesnt say per serving  nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving  im assuming that you get 1000 mg of reishi and chaga per tube  i looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules i have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so i guess one tube also contains 1000 mg  overall i think this is a good product especially useful right before bedtime to promote a better nights sleep and it tastes good too
i do not often eat nutrition bars but when i need to these are the ones i select  they are not too sweet chock full of good little crunchy things and priced well  i cannot find them in retail stores even tho i shop at organic groceries and wonder why they are not more widely available
my french class was reading a few of the childrens stories upon which this film is based  after watching the film the consensus was this is a good film if not great  might be better suited for an audience of children than adults  that is probably for whom it was intended
but i dont get a lot of support from it for your knee you need more support than what this brace offers the side supports are not metal they are a plastic and bend easily enough i dont fight the fit to be very good and am disappointed in this knee brace
i have used sea moss gummies before  but i must admit that i was a little scared to try the real thing  since i like to keep my diet in the raw as much as possible  i decided to give this a shot  honestly  its basically tasteless  it has a very faint oceany flavor that i barely notice  if i put it in a smoothie  i dont notice it at all  the texture reminds me of chia seed jam  it works really well as a thickener in smoothie bowls and pudding if you are gluten free  its a good way to thicken soups as well  the serving size is very low so this bag should last a long time
i had given her mom one previously but she said she had never seen it because mommy keeps everything for herself that is a 12 year olds opinion so i got her this one and if she cant get those blackheads our of her face with the machine then she use the tools that are included
always use them extra soft
i found that this traction device is of the utmost highest quality than all the rest also if you have any questions you can contact the company and they will assist you  my surgery liked it so good the he was going to recommend it to his other patients  it is easy to adjust up and down and very comfortable as much as traction can be i have tried several others and this is by far the best for a soft traction device
i used it maybe 10 times and it stopped working i used a small torx screwdriver and took the screw out of the bottom and used a small flat screw driver to put in the slot to slide the cutter head off of the plastic base i took my old razor head tabs broke off like everyone elses and compared and they are very similar but whatever grease they are using fails pretty quickly and becomes sticky causing the hair to get stuck i suppose you could clean their grease off and use a white lithium grease or something and it would work fine but i just decided to swap my old oem cutter head into the new plastic base works great now
45these zep cleaners that came in the zep cleaning bundle work perfectly just like brand names if not better than somethis bundle comes with an all purpose cleaner and a streak free glass cleaner the all purpose cleaner is a degreaser as well and it works brilliantly we had grease splatter on the stove top and i was dreading the clean up but figured it would be a great test for this stuff i gave it a spray let it sit for 60 seconds attempted a wipe up and wow the grease came right up i was impressed i wasnt 100 in love with the smell but the cleaning power sold methe glass cleaner i would definitely say is in line with other blue glass cleaners it only streaked if i wiped it really poorly i can streak any windowmirrorglass surface imaginable i am so bad at that it had the normal smell that you would expect i liked it a loti thought both these cleaners were very good im not sure about the price and how it compares to other cleaners though even though i definitely recommend these for their cleaning power i did have to take just a tad off for the slightly higher cost
i ordered this because i have a hip replacement coming up and after checking out the walkers medicare would provide for me decided this is a much better option while ive only tried it out so far i am pleased with its appearance and solidity it is very sturdy and with the back wheels being further apart than are the front wheels there is more room for me another feature that i really like is that i can pull up on the strap in the middle of the seat and fit it through a narrow bathroom door while still using it for support while this is a heavy nylon seatand not paddedit and the back fit me well and provide solid lumbar support someone else looked at it today and was quite impressed she said they paid over 500 for a walker for her brother that was flimsy with metal that quickly bent so that the thing was useless she plans to get one of these for her mother the only downside seems to be that the included cupholder cant be put on without loosening a strangelooking screwwe have to find a screwdriver that will fit it a cane holder is also included the velcroattached bag is good sized if you want to go to the hassle of removing 8 screwgizmos with large plastic heads they are easy to do and lower the arms it will fit in the included bag
perfect we need this because the toilet is very low good product
this is the 56th bp monitor that i have tried and ordered through amazon either via purchase or the vine program and is a basic monitor almost every single monitor takes my bp within a few points of each other and this ones accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors this one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user note that i did not take 180 readings so this is unverified after the reading it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse it averages the bp after three successful bp readings but the average recall is not marked as an average most monitors identify an average with the avg notation it has an irregular heartbeat indicator  there is one large cuff provided that will fit most people there are two power options available and included and that is four aaa batteries or via a usb type c cable time settings are in the 24hour clock military time only voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy chinese accentincluded in the package one bp unit one bp user manual and one digital pamphlet one large cuff one cloth carry pouch one usb type c cable and 4 aaa batteriesfeatures up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory date and time settings are available in 24hour clock only setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual the lcd display readout is large for easy reading the cuff is 22 to 42 cm 866 to 16535 inches which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese clearing all the bp settings is just a matter of holding the mem button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until all ee appears the display is large accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors press and hold the set button when power is off wait until the user indicator blinks and then press mem to switch to the other user it displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such it has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female chinese accentnegatives the cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance the average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the avg indicator what happens is that after three readings the first number displayed is the average the next three numbers and beyond are the readings once i cycle through all the readings the average is never displayed again unless i turn off the unit and then press the memory button again the voice option is moderated by a heavy female chinese accentthis is an acceptable bp monitor operation and setup of this unit is simple once i read the manual to take my blood pressure i affixed the cuff around my left arm with my palm turned up i made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor then i pressed start and after a little bit i had my reading i pressed stop to turn off the unit the systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayedblood pressure is never the same from moment to moment so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes it is important for a user to learn how to take their bp to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when in fact it is user error there are many great videos online that can help teach thisin summary this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual the cuff is large enough for most people and the lcd display is large and easy to read it displays an avg after three readings but that is not marked the voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented the current price is not listed but any price at 24 or below would be reasonable for thisfor those who are interested i attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5star monitors these monitors i consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others i tested i listed two 4star monitors because they have unique features such as spanish speaking or bluetooth each one of these monitors is accurate and i would highly recommend any of them  this is known as the gold standard of bp monitors it stores 100 readings between 2 users it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an ac adapter can be purchased separately the arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people   this is the monitor i use most often in the winter so i do not have to disrobe to expose my arm it stores 120 readings between 2 users it is great for portability comes with a hard case and is battery operated in addition it has cp g correct position guidance to ensure the user does not make an error that only works if it is turned on accuracy is spot on which is atypical of wrist monitors   this is great if a talking monitor in both english and spanish is needed it stores 120 readings between 2 users in addition to battery operation it comes with an ac adapter two very flimsy cuffs and a case if the cuffs were better this would be my favorite arm monitor  this is a great monitor with a large cuff two power sources 4 aaa batteries or ac cable and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each 45 stars  this monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes the lcd display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green yellow and red based on the hypertension levelwhich is excellent there are two power options it takes four aaa batteries or a usb type c cable both are included there is an average feature after two readings there are date or time settings in ampm not military time the cuff size is large there is an irregular heartbeat indicator accuracy is spot on   this is one unique monitor the monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the ios or android app vihealth the cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small operation is simple this is rechargeable and comes with the usb type c cable for charging there is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app there is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app in fact the readings can be associated with multiple users number and amount unknown the date and time are automated through the bluetooth pairing with the app as of june 2022 the app is quirky and does not always connect the bp unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone the  is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulationtens option both are 4 stars  this monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes the lcd display is large and easy to read there are two power options of either four aa batteries not included or a microusb cable included there is an average feature after two readings there are date or time settings in 24hour clock military time only the cuff size is large and will fit most users there is also voice broadcast mode and two alarm options this does not have an irregular heartbeat indicator  45 stars
did not work  i returned this item
i had high hopes for this as i suffer from neck pain that radiates up into my head at times may be stress maybe misalignment not sure but it didnt help me with my problem its possible it needs to be used for a longer period of time to get any results but its very uncomfortable and a few times i felt  like it almost made it worse maybe it was just not  a good match for my problem but for my personal experience i cannot say it helped
this is a good kit that has the heavy duty metal rasp and the finer sandpaper type on the 2 sided tool  my husbands feet get cracked on heelscalluses during winter and mine more so in summer from wearing sandalsthis is the perfect thing for using in the shower or just sitting down and taking care of yr feet  the nail brush also included is used almost every day and really is handy to have
if i could give this 10 stars i would this is the second product i purchased to clean our napoleon wood burning fireplace glass doors the first product required harsh scrubbing and many reapplications to get the soot off with this product the soot practically falls off no scrubbing absolutely effortless amazing product
just received this and so far love it it had a charge but i charged it overnight in my phone charger and used every accessory the next day it still had plenty of power left 1520min of playing around with it no pain with any and the facial hair remover worked great no redness or hair seen 2 days later im 53 dark haired with light complexion the nose trimmer piece came apart when i went to put it on and it was tricky putting it back together but i eventually got it not my favorite to use but it works not sure about the eyebrow trimmer but i didnt buy it for that i didnt try the body shaver as i had shaved my legs  underarms that day so far i am very happy with this purchase and feel its a great buy overall would definitely recommend
a great collection of ingredients in one mix  im a 330 lb male and 1 dose gives me a good nonjittery energy boost and even if im hungry i wont want to eat_ i dont workout i just  take this at work about midshift since i have a physically fast paced job and it keeps me going goodthe tasterotten raspberry  lemon rindyeah its badhowever  with a simple trick you can get it tasting actually goodremedy for bad tastewhen i mix me a concoction of this stuff i use an 185 oz plastic bottle and fill it 60 full of filtered water_i use a kitchen funnel and scoop into the bottle 112 scoops of the rootz mix and shake well_get some powdered welchs grape drink mix its actually low sugar per scoop and scoop about only 12  34 a scoop provided in container into the bottle via funnel_ shake well fill up with filtered water shake well again_this will neutralize the awful bitterness  tartness without making it sweet or loading it with sugar_if you prefer it sweet you can add a little more grape mix_as for a remedy for the graininess  if its annoying then get a small marble mocaljete and pummel the powder finer_ i havent done this yet but its a logical solutioni only gave it 4 s because it seems that the makers could easily remedy the terrible taste  graininess pretty easily so for lack of a little effort i couldnt rate it 5
pro easy to use and lightweightcon just keeps me from moving my head without turning my shoulders neck brace doesnt pull my neck up for adjustment like i thought it would
this is something my husband takes with his vitamin regiment  he likes the taste
this is a very nice toothpaste it is definitely funky using toothpaste that is black but you get used to it it tastes pretty good and cleanse your teeth very well i would recommend mixing it up with regular toothpaste though because it can strip your teeth because of the charcoal it does have some bad breath eliminating features which i like and it can help whiten your teeth dont expect to have like bright white teeth because of this but it can neutralize some stains which is nice i really like this one but i am not making this my own and only toothpaste but actually rotate it with another one i use
complete waste of money does nothing just like wearing a regular pair of socks
this is a great product  very powerful  please follow the mixing and use instructions
the product you get comes in three syringes you apply 1ml to a spoon and eat the gel its fussy and kind of weirdly flavored the whole syringe thing is weird it is best refrigerated after you open each syringe yes i believe it is a good product and effective however the delivery system is really most suitable for people who have syringe fetishes and a lot of time on their hands id much prefer to have had the product in a softgel
i got this for my wife who was in the process to quit smoking  she said the setup for this device was straight forward and the app is easy to use the device is accurate if she had a cigarette the co 2 numbers would be higher for her the co2 number was a clear reminder of the progress that she was making overall she recommends this as it helped her quit smoking
i was so glad to find this supplement at this high dose  im taking this several times a day now every day and can tell it is beginning to help with insomnia foggy feeling and concentration  the main purpose in taking this however is long term as it is supposed to prevent disabling memory loss  and ill do anything i can for that  this brand seems to be top quality and to know what theyre talking about
it feeds your body what it might be lacking its overall something should be apart of your daily routine i would get it again
came in my monthly box works as intended box wasnt damaged seals were intact
these are posted  listed with 33 more loads with 66 as total  i received 2 of the regular size with 25 loads 50 total loads  please correct the listing to reflect the normal size bottles
the foot bath is nicely designed only issue i have is that i like the temperature at 90 degrees even when i set the temperature to 90 degrees it heats up to more than 100 degrees see photo there may be an issue with the thermostat
its so hard to find a chapstick that is both cruelty free and vegan so while i did consider these a bit pricy for chapstick its definitely worth it most of the flavors are amazing i especially love the peach coconut one however the patchouli one is kind of strange it smellstastes like i just smeared incense on my lips and not in a good way it almost has a smell that seems like it should not be going on my lips like i said though the other scents are amazing and very moisturizing definitely will be buying more of these
too too strong to wear i get a headache and lose balance and eyes need to readjust
works well nice good deal
this product contains lead completely shocked its still on the market and being sold disgusted that this product is being sold on amazon
just right shape for shoulders and it holds heat well
this powder mixes in well although the directions say to mix in two whole scoops it tastes pretty good except that it does have a bit of that protein flavorall in all its pretty decent for the price
the rolls are tiny the paper a bit harsh but it does the job
these are my favorite whitening strips i have purchased them twice now i love how gentle they are because my teeth are a little sensitive and i cannot handle the products that come with led lights or professional whitening done by a dentist i have also tried charcoal whitening products and i found them to be too abrasive other brands of whitening strips such as crest i have found too harsh mr bright strips can be left on for 1030 minutes and you can use them occasionally for a touchup or consecutively for the full 14 days i had to write a review for this product because i recommend it to everyone do not expect dramatic results because they are gentle and an otc item but they are definitely worth it i think the results are noticeable and they last for a few months i tend to use these a week before a special event or if i just feel like my teeth are looking dull
these are made in china and the quality shows  the sound is acceptable but not great  the headphones get hot at times and i am worried about that  i dont think these are worth 26 dollars but it seems like that is the lowest price going for these  if you are looking for a cheap headset for a young kid i would get these but dont expect much from them
first of all im a chiropractor that specializes in corrective care and this is my new absolute favorite traction device first of all its adjustable so youll be able to customize the perfect fit for yourself and as far as the design goes its comfortable and snug i noticed immediate relief in tension and increased range of motion bravo chirolux
i think weve used about every wipe there is to use between the 3 of my children8 months to 5 years with newborns pampers was my choice i had to change diapers often and they worked great at working against diaper rash admittedly though as my children got older we gravitated toward huggies wipes pampers seems to have different kinds of wipes there was one kind that seemed so slimy we couldnt bear to use it and it seemed that no matter how hard we tried we ended up with that particular one we keep wipes just about everywhere and use them on our hands tooparticularly during car rides we prefer huggies when it comes to hand usethese are great though when it comes to backsides they are a little more on the slimy side than huggies but these are more durable with huggies wipes theyre constantly tearing or we end up pulling out 4 wipes stuck togetherthese seem to come apartfrom each othermuch better you can tug and pull on these and see just how much more durable they are we generally have better coupons from pampers so we usually end up with pampers wipes ill be honest though and say that when we have the coupons we get huggies wipes we like them both for different reasons we only use one of the two though from my experience and opinion just forget generic brands when it comes to wipesif your little one has a sensitive backside though i highly recommend these these are scented so if that bothers you theres the unscented sensitive kind too
these are great  they really help with polishing up your skin for the summer
handy and usefulholds up well
lots of room for morning and evening medications easy to open and stays closed the cover is good for hiding your pills when you are on vacation the cover is pretty but i expect it to eventually peel due to being pu leather
one of the best tasting low carb bars out there definitely in the top 5  grenade knows how to make a good tasting bar and has spread that knowledge across all flavors  very good
been looking like crazy for a cring of this material no it is not just silicone it is special and it makes the difference i will order 3 more cause i know this one will be stolen

excellent value low cost works greatim a large person and it covers me perfectlyvery soft warm and easy to use no problem with wires getting tangled or feeling hard uncomfortable while wearingcan pull down lower to cover top of legs or put all of it on legs for a nice warm blankethighly recommend
package arrived in great condition nice amount for the low price love these puffs
i got this for my husband because it has a 550 lb weight capacity so i figured it would be pretty durable when it arrived i assembled it and sat on it to try it out one of the wheels immediately broke and i am nowhere close to 550 lbs  i tried to return it but amazon referred me to the manufacturer the link they provided just took me to the sales website the phone number rang to a message service i bought my own set of replacement wheels and its working out ok now
theyre pretty but dont really affect the smoking experience the only time you taste it is if you lick it directly
light weight love the colors and they do not bother my neck when i am wearing them
really sad this heating pad didnt heat very soft and packaged with its own nylon sleeve but that doesnt bring relief to achy muscles sadly had to return
started with the spinach and kale chips the lipo3 spray and the supergreens with beneful i usually dont eat anything when i am fasting but i have been having difficulty getting back on track and this should help after this is out my south beach supplies should be here and i can continue eating healthy and lose the weight i wish to lose by the way the supergreens are just how i like them no yucky flavorings to hide the natural grass and chlorella taste
the only thing i really use out of this set is the glass nail file it works incredibly well the other multicolored files just take up space wasnt pleased with them
i do my own nail tips and i would recommend this product
i have tried a few different versions of neck traction devicesneck stretchers and have found they all are quite similar with some slight variations in size and designthis one is slightly smaller than others something that works well for me at 54 like the others it is not soft despite what it may look like the foam is very hard as its intended to be in order to support your head and neck and to provide a thorough stretch there are also some pressure nodes on the device which are really just bumps in the foam but are positioned to provide a bit of acupressure and massage while youre lying on it personally i dont notice the bumps but its possible theyre doing their jobif youre new to this type of neck device know that it takes a while to get used to it when i first started it was quite painful and i managed only a couple of minutes at a time now i use it once or twice a day for about ten minutes at a time the benefits are immediately noticeable as it relieves the tension in my neck and shoulders that always develops after a day spent at my computerthis particular device unlike others i have used comes with a zippered carryingstorage bag as well as an eye mask and ear plugs none of these are crucial to the neck traction device but are nice extras some reviewers noted a bad smell when they received their device i had no such issues with mineif  youre looking for a way to relieve neck and shoulder pain without resorting to medication this is definitely worth a try
i bought this spray to try in my husbands work boots the scent is a little strong but it seems to do the trick i just spray the inside of his boots after work and generally the next day his feet dont smell the smell could be a little overwhelming for those sensitive to scents
very cheap and its shows but get the job done
works great so far i put it on charge before use didnt take long and light turns green when its chargedlay the clothes flat turned it on and went over a couple shirts with it in a circular motion you could hear it when it cuts off a lint ball its not loud its easy to use and safe to have around kids because there are no sharp pieces exposed unless you open it to clean it outcleaning is also easy you just unscrew the top and guide the included brush along the sides of it and toss the lint i actually was shocked at how much came off just a couple of shirts im glad this works because alot of my clothes started to look worn and ugly with the pilling ive tried an actual razor but that was a pain in the bum so im happy with this product and ive had no issues so far
one thing about senna gon make you go it gets the job done i mixed it with honey and lemon
it cleaned my shower wonderfully
after weighing 250 pounds for the last six yearsincluding during periods when i ate less andor increased my exercise and lost no weight i have dropped to 230 in only three months using mcg i eat whatever i wantalthough i am dramatically less hungry than i ever used to be and i have virtually no cravings for sweets unheardof for me and i am not exercising at all just as a matter of documentation im 46 and 64i have 30 more pounds to lose and the only reason this is a fourstar review instead of a 5star review is that my weight loss does appear to have stopped its been difficult to find clear guidance on whether its safe to take more of the supplement and if so how much more and that too is frustrating i dont know anything about other brands of this stuff although i saw a consumer something or other report in which a couple of the other 34top34 brands were found by laboratory analysis to have either less or none of the active ingredient in them this particular brand was not included in that study at allim not brand loyal by any meansi dont give a darn who makes it and am more than happy to switch if i find a cheaper manufacturerbut i have stuck with miracle because it worked at least this far and i still have three bottles leftto those who tried this and had no benefit i dont know what to say other than that i am sorry for your lack of results i regularly eat steak chicken salmon and halibut rice homemade pasta quality cheese organic fresh fruits and veggies dry roast almonds homemade ice cream and homemade cherry pie a no sugar added recipe for the latter and i drink about 2 cups of twinings green tea every day as i said about i find im hungry for and thus just comfortably eat much less of these foods at eat sitting than ever before and have been happy to do so the supplement is expensive but i have saved a ton of money taking dinner leftovers to work for lunch the next dayassuming i continue to have curbed cravings and reduced appetite and assuming my weight loss resumes soon i really couldnt be happier its hard for me to imagine that this is just a fluke after trying to budge my weight unsuccessfully for six years and then lose 20 pounds in 90 days will it all come back ifwhen i stop taking the supplement is the supplement safe to take longterm to keep my weight down if the cravings return as far as i can tell nobody knows yetif anybody cares ill be happy to post an update as time continues to pass today is may 25 2014
i really like this brand of contact lens cleaner works the best for me
so this is not regular powdered horsetail like you would normally buy  this is 7 so that means they add extra extract which is going to make this stronger and extremely bitter since i eat my herbs like food i dont want this extra extract added to it  the taste is overwhelming and bitter  plus its not green  good fresh dried horsetail powder is supposed to be green  this is also from china  i normally get my powdered horsetail grass from starwest herbs and its organic and from croatia and tastes wonderful and fresh  this stufftastes gross wrong color not organic and from china  i bought this because it was cheaper than the starwest so i thought id give it a try  but totally not worth it  you get what you pay for  im going back to the more expensive horsetail from starwest which is exactly the way horsetail is supposed to look and taste  i like bulksupplements normally  for supplements and amino acids vitamins minerals and chemicaltype stuff  i highly recommend bulk supplements for vitamins and supplements their quality is good and the price is excellent  for herbs i would recommend starwest or frontier  definitely not bulksupplements
works well
this is my 34th order i am using it for my cats with renal issues so far it seems to really be helpful i just add it to the daily drinking water and all drink from it  so the do not mind any taste if there is  one  it dissolves easily in water
bought these due to the coating hoping they would help in the lower gut did nothing if fact sometimes they pass right through whole  undigested 12 hours later
purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder  it is less messy than regular powder however it doesnt work as well  and it is oddly greasy  he reports that it is lotiony in a weird way  since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry  if its lotiony or greasy not so muchif youre hoping for a replacement for powder  this isnt it  at least in my husbands opinion
so glad to have found this supplement in a large quantity at a low price it is the exact same supplement i was getting at my drug store at a much higher price
i have one heaping teaspoon a day and its like eating 3 lbs of carrots  could you eat 3 lbs of carrot a day i know i canta great product
since i plugged this in a week ago and my litter box cleaning days have not changed i am having no odor at all   revealing the existence of a cat in my house  it makes almost no noise and the only indication that it is on is a soft blue light and a slight breeze  i cant attest to it creating a germless environment  how do you test that   but just for the odor management this is worth the price  we are in the midst of allergy season and i havent experienced  any lessening of symptoms so it may not be much help with allergies  if you have a cat or dog though this is a winner
super big bottles and ample amount for the price  i was already familiar with this brand and have trusted it  easy to swallow  no fishy aftertaste or burps  really no complaints or regrets
these were great for my birthday i definitely would recommend it for anyone looking for decorations
these hemostats are very hard to open and close almost impossible to do with one hand ive used many different pairs of hemostats over the years and these are really just terrible
so far my husband loves this dental plaque remover this is not going to take the place of your dental hygienist but it will help maintain in between my husband has crooked teeth so this helpsthe instructions are pretty much nonexistent so that is huge minus when it comes to this product you would basically have to figure it all out on your ownoverall the product seems to work but time will tell just need to have better instructionsnote take off the flimsy rubber tips first
not good nail cutters
mens potty portable pee bottle portable urinals for men reusable male pee bottle camping toilet thicken mens potty  nice to have in an emergency i am putting this in my emergency kit to save for an emergency  oz
love it it works no bug bites or sunburns plus no icky bug spray smell i use it on my 8 month old and no rash or reactions
works well and price is good
i had to return this item as the handle was stuck and would not come out of the case  it was totally stuck and would not budge  i wrote to frank shaving company in china and they were not helpful i bought another wsp monarch silver tip badger to replace the returned item
not bad better then my car seat
some people only refer to facial tissue with one word dont be like those peoplepros  softer than the eponym  better boxes than the eponymcons  why are you reading this add them to your subscriptions  seriously stop  im leaving this review while my wife watches some singing show i wonder who is under this rhino mask
product was received on time and in great condition im a satisfied customer mls
thank you in advance to the amazon vine program for providing an item to review a positive review was not required nor was it requested and all words are my ownmy mother and i suffer from chronic pain  knees back shoulderpart of pain management is heat therapy in some cases  moist heatit is difficult to get a moist heating pad and its also difficult to get it to contour or fit the difficult areas  knees shoulder  ankle either youre awkwardly sitting laying or balancing somethingid been seeing and hearing about these microwave packs and took a chance on itthis was a dual pack so that meant one for my almost 70 year old mom who lives with me and one for mefirst thing that struck me when i got the package  what the heck did i order it was heavy i almost worried that perhaps id gotten something i couldnt usei took one and gave one to my mothershe was the first to use it she loved it only 120 seconds 2 minutes in the microwave and it lasts for about 10 minutes she can place it on her shoulder and it stays put the moist heat does the trick in alleviating paina few days after she tried hers my knee was in horrific pain it was so bad i was dragging it around so i warmed mine up and as hers didnt get that warm  i went three 3 minutes i wrapped it around my knee with the velcro and  wow it was hot i could barely tolerate it so this really gets hot ive had regular heating pads on high heat and barely felt it this  i felt iti didnt have it on that long but i can state  this gets warm and it stays warmthe velcro closure is heavy duty and i felt like i might end up tearing the poor thing the weight makes sure it stays in placewe love it and honestly it might the last heating pad we ever get also  theyre huge
i absolutely love these prerolls first off they are made out of natural cotton cellulose water and glycerin  all natural ingredients  not plastic  and they smoke sooooo well i highly recommend purchasing
i have been wanting to buy a henry mask for a while finally i bought one it is so welldesigned and fits my face nicely they are breathable as described also they are stylish the straps are very comfortable and do not aggravate me i will be buying more of these masks
i hate vinegarany  i read it is good for so many things i thought i would give it a try
works good for my mother who is 91
i bought this because i read that it helps with constipation issues after taking this supplement for several days i found my constipation issue were much worse and i was bloating a lot i would not recommend this supplement if your looking to alleviate constipation
seems to be legit  i get a little nervous buying from 3rd parties due to possible knock offs
my husband said he was not impressed by this flavor and it took a lot to get a hint of the orange he did say he got a hit of orange creamsicle taste but it too a great deal of the product to get that hint also this product is not part of prime and the shipping cost was more then the price i paid so not a great bargain unless you were to buy many more flavors this is not the first capella flavor he has tried and while they indeed taste like the descriptions it takes a great deal more product to achieve then other brands now this is in reference to using it to make homemade vape juice and im sure if using for food purposes the flavor would be must stronger all in all its just ok and will not be ordering again
acai is great if you want to reduce your appetite if you eat for pleasure then it might not work as well i found that in two months of taking this supplement i didnt lose a great deal of weight as reported in some reviews but i did see dramatic results in the clarity and radiance of my skin this supplement contains powerful antioxidants which protect the cells from free radicals so if you are interested in skin health then i can recommend this to you for me it hasnt helped me lose weight in a dramatic way as advertised in many blogsthe rebecca review
these pads work great nice
this glasses strap stays on the glasses even with thin ear pieces  i would order it again
love this its  all natural its lasts a very long time have found a way to make this to save money
works good my legs are so soft after i use this
compact classy little pill case not much else to say its so simple but looks nice on my keychain with brown leather and other brass items
cute packaging and i like the scooper because it makes it really easy to fill my water bottles this cherry flavor is really off it has a weird aftertaste thats sort of plastickyi drink caffeine powder mixes daily and this wasnt what i expected it didnt smell weird to me like another person commented but the flavor isnt good at all  the other flavors might be better
best stuff ever  cant be without  good for joints  i feel and look hydrated highly recommended
these socks are great the fabric is soft smooth lovely feels really nice next to my skin i love how colorful  fun these compression socks are because all ive found up until now were just drab tan black or white stockings that looked hideous just because i have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities feet calves doesnt mean i want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose these are so cute bright  colorful the only downside is that i am wearing these due to leg swelling  when my calves are real swollen which is often unfortunately the design on some of these socks gets stretched out making it so you lose the very thing that makes these so pretty the design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost at times  not so colorful this hasnt happened on all the ones ive purchased i have about 6 pairs but definitely on some of them if youre very thin or dont experience much swelling this probably wont be a problem at all a solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes maybe just small  large
i like these pacific gloves there nicer then other gloves i have bought beforethe gloves are very comfortable not the heavy thick ones  that i have bought at the grocery store before thathave always been too big clumsy  and uncomfortable and i usually would only use about 3 times and forget about themthese are a size medium fit me but the small would have been better i have long thin fingersthe inside is soft and actually feels goodi use these pacific gloves for doing the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and washing my heavy cast iron pansthese gloves get a good grip on heavy cookwarei also like the sleeves  are long and the water does not run inside and i use them for gardeninggood price for two utility gloves
not for me stomach upset
i love this dry brush  ive never heard of dry brushing before but im glad i did  the dry brush is very invigorating  i used it on the backs of my arms and legs and my back in circular motions i wish now i had bought the handle my husband helped me it felt so good and left my skin with a rosy glow  after showering i felt the circulation much improved in all the areas i brushed  first day it just felt good the second time i used it i noticed my skin tightening a bit and the skin on my arms felt softer even my lotion seemed to absorb better  im very satisfied with the construction of the brush also  its well worth what i paid  the strap is secure and it has a groove in the back to attach a handle which im purchasing right away
these are surprisingly thicker than i imagined but still allowed me enough maneuverability to get dishes and household cleaning done my hands are on the smaller side so this is always an ongoing issue for being as sturdy as they are i like that i could still use them these gloves provide a great alternative to anyone with latex issues only used these for a week or so but there are no signs of wear on them as yet
this flavor is scrumptious very soft and creamy almost feels like a full calorie full sugar dessert but without all the carbs and sugars very satisfying to me just remember to warm them in a micro for just a few seconds thats the big catch so dont plan on using them for on the go unless you leave them someplace warm where they will stay soft
great pads and they wash up nice only issue is that since the cleaning agents are in the disposable pads from irobot you get just plain water unless you spray your floors with cleaner i used the wet mop pads to get the sticky dirty stuff and then used a disposable to get the floors clean by running the mop again
these detergent packs have a really awful odor when you open the container  i didnt want them to be scented and they arent but they have an offputting odor for sure  they do not make the dishes or the air smell bad thankfully  they also work very well and do not leave any residue on the dishes  4 stars for that smellbleh
great product only issue is getting it on the walker so its stable and also i suggest having a two sided rubber trivit like a jar opener to reduce anything sliding on the tray when you walk
i have been using this for grilling and salads and it tastes great i am not too crazy about the plastic bottle though so i used it to top off a glass bottle that i had previously used and will continue to add to that one it has a very smooth taste and many many uses
this massager is ok  i can recline in my zerogravity chair and its pretty nice behind my low back holds up to my weight but i can tell its starting to struggle a little as opposed to another brand i have that doesnt give in at all i also wouldnt advertise it as a neck massager  its too wide for the neck scrapes the outline of the traps but thats about it not bad on upper back its a onetrick pony but thats what these little massage pillows are its a 35  pretty good not great and compared to another one ive reviewed slightly underwhelming enough to not give it a 4
works as intended
this is an attractive and giftable set of six bath bombs the amazon site says the four fragrances are lavender vanilla rose and orange but it was hard for me to detect those aromas they all smell nice  but the fragrance difference is super subtle they are made with essential oilsi tried the greenishbluishyellow bomb in my foot bath i used hot to tepid water and suds were created in the foot bath and the bomb fizzed as shown in the video it eventually in about 10 minutes dissolved in the water as i bathed my feet my feet felt clean and i liked the subtle scent my feet also came out feeling  soft unfortunately there was a slight adherence of the green color of the bomb to my ankles and heels but it was ever so slight a white bathtub might develop a slight ring of color around it from these bombs but i suspect it would immediately wash off insofar as performance these bombs are really good luckily i had a strainer in my sink because i had no idea there was a surprise miniature animal figurine in these i had a little dinosaur in mine although no price is listed i suspect these will be priced between 1699 and 1899
i need dark to sleep  these do the job blocking light perfectly and comfortably
cute nail trimmer gets the job done
they were all tangled up together in a baggy they are awfully thin and of poor quality several of them broke after 2 or 3 uses they were packaged in a sloppy manner
i take it with meals especially ones that are heavy in fat and it helps with digestion i used to get bloated and my motility bowel movements would be slow but taking this product along with my main meals gets ride of the bloating also i feel a little more energy  in a sense that since i am not bloated all the time i have an easier time to move around and be active
i compared this with elderberry emergenc ec  the ingredients are similar as far as sugar 5g vit d3 125 and 50mg elderberry  this one has 25mg zinc227 compared with 10mg with ec vitamin c is low at 270mg 1000mg ec i like more vit c  this one does have turmeric root extract 140mg which scores with me  salt is the 4th ingredient with 23 of daily sodium 29 chloride  thats a lot for me  i definitely taste ityou absolutely need to mix this in 16ou of water  it doesnt fizz  stir it  mild citrus taste  overall not my cup of sports drink or immunity drink  i think if youre out sweating hard like a lineman in a football game or prefer more nacl than this will work for you  the ingredients and packaging otherwise look good
you cannot curl lashes with this product but the customer service is great i returned without any problems
nice large 21oz bottle of a body lotion i have not heard of beforethe scent is cherry almond the first scent i smelled when using this is cherry which is not my favoritei like almond better but the scent does not last longthis is not a greasy lotion it goes into my skin my legs and hands have been very dry and my other lotionswhere not helping muchbut this mountain falls seems to help to soften my hands and the do look better in a short timeim not a fan of some of the ingredients in this  so i was surprised my hands do not look so old after using this a fewtimes a daycame nicely packaged and no leaks but the trouble i had with this bottle was getting the pump to come up soi could use thisnot deducting for that
not more than a glorified piece of velcro not what was expected
this has really helped with the styes in my eyes i had about 2 on the rim of my upper eye lid and one on the rim of my lower eye lid and i had a couple of styes on my other eye too i used to apply this oil 23 times a day with a q tip after going through a couple of bottles i found they had all disappeared one after the other over a period of 12 months no side effects nothing
i loved it i just barely got it it arrived pretty fast it looks way better then i thought it would feels and looks high end it works waayyy better than some high ends eyelash curlers i have had  can be compared to other ones that i bought for a ridiculous price i super recomend this one you get a great product for an amazing price
i buy a lot of turmeric powder either from amazon or from my nearest multicultural food market  i make what is called golden paste out of turmeric coconut oil water and freshly ground black pepper  it has helped me and my husband immensely with bone and joint health  im 62 and play very competitive tennis singles and doubles against opponents less than half my age and i often win  i am a true believer in the miracle of golden paste as my previously super sore and creaky knees have been transformed into those of a 25 year olds  no kidding  please google golden paste and see how easy it is to make at home and give it a try  when this organic turmeric came up on my list of items i could review it took less than a nano second to select it  i think its wonderful it comes in 3 smaller bags instead of one big one and it seems to be among the best organic turmeric ive used
these work great to wipe if you can keep hold of them they slide all around and they dry out pretty fast i think if they were each maybe twice as big it wouldnt be so difficult to use these to remove nail polish i have to stack 2 together to effectively remove the nail polish but they are lint free there no problem there
while packaged attractively and according to the company website  all organic ingredients it is not clear how much evidence there is for the longterm or short term effectiveness of the aromatherapy blends  this particular blend is heavy on ginger but dissipates very quickly  while no doubt the initial whiff provides a positive awakening energy it doesnt linger long enough to be able to notice significant change in mood or any symptoms  unsure if at this price point it provides significant advantage over using ones own blends in diffusers
i was ready to throw my shoes in the garbage this saved them after 2 applications
christmas hat that is cute and fits nicely
bought this for my daughters law and she just loves it she gets to practice at home away from her job she was pleased so i am satisfied the delivery was quick and the packaging who great
these are so handy to have around especially if youre really into health and beauty stuff they are on the thin side when you open them up and remind me of gauze just a little thicker and more absorbent but i find theyre very useful folded as is in the containeri use these with my toner or just to blot my face after washing and before adding my serum i also use them to wrap up open beauty products so that they dont get all dusty or damaged ie brushes in that way theyre best opened up and wrapped around the itemthis is a huge pack so if you just use 12 a day like me its going to last a good amount of time these are also good when doing mild chemical peels at home  for applying the peelserum to your face much like cotton ballsrounds these are a musthave for any beauty enthusiasta discounted sample was provided for evaluation and unbiased review
for my condition the male comfort fit  advantage is easy to use and easy to empty and clean in the morning
i finally have to admit that im getting older and my feet hurt when i wear boots in particular  after a couple of hours in i have to take them off or sit down because the balls of my feet will burn and its just uncomfortablei have some knee damage and i broke my foot a few years ago so these days even more than before i am aware of how uncomfortable feet affect my mood  my posture and my balancewhen you are not walking straight and even late  it can affect your hip and lower back as well  these insoles are an absolute godsend in my pictures youll see how much thicker they are near the balls of the feet than the ones you get at the store  or even the custom ones i had made at a local store nothing beats these for comfort the gel is thick and distributes evenly in such a way that i feel like im wearing my slippers all day i live in south texas where boots are an absolute staple in the summer or winter and these insoles have made such a differenceyou will have to cut them down to size just like with most insoles that you buy at the store  and since they are thicker than any others i have ever bought i do need to wear thinner socks but since boots western ones in particular tend to be a little roomier  these insoles work perfectly with themi dont know what negative ion technology is but i really dont need to know the details all i need to know is that these will stay in my boots and i will replace them every six months as recommended because ive never been more comfortable in my boots after wearing them the first day my daughter borrowed them from me and put them in her shoes because she was planning on a long day at school and work she too was amazedat 23 years old she has discovered that gel insoles are not just for old ladies like her mom i never thought id be sitting here riding along review about my feet come on my boots or insoles but here i am raving about my latest discovery i can definitely recommend this to anyone
was suppose to come with a case and it didnt and it doesnt work good at all
bright colors on black background on a good sized poster  colors pop  only complaint would be that i wish was more detailed  the 6 x 4 book cover to accompany the poster has more detail just harder to see  for a beginner is perfect
great product  i recently purchased and used emmys best pet odor  stain eraser  my dog was a naughty puppy and urinated in our family room and the odor was strong after receiving the product i carefully followed the instructions that came with it  the results are astounding it worked there is no more odor no more stain and my dog does not show any interest in returning to the spot  i will be a repeat customer
this is great for when i get really wound up tackling too many projects at once when my body is tired but my brain wont shut down to sleep and when i cant stay asleep for a good nights rest i like that it is a natural source of melatonin plain melatonin is synthesized because it occurs in such small amounts naturally i take this amino acid with others to support my health i trust source naturals i havent found any problems with their products on consumer labs website ive been taking ltryptophan for a couple years intermittently and daily for the past three months
i read the reviews and was scared it might break when installing so i called drive medical and a tech walked me through each step not only that but he took the model number and installed one with me while we were on the phone that way he was able to give more detailed instructions when the upper washer seemed to not fit well it got installed in about 5 minutes with no tools and is perfect for me there are more expensive models but this has all the features recommended by my occupational therapist in fact she installed it with me she thought it important for me to have an onoff switch in the handle and the ability to divert water into the regular shower head as needed its the perfect length color and very easy for me to handle plus it came in 24 hours and i didnt pay extra
i recommend this to everyone this is a life saver if you have a baby or a child that has nose discharge or is congested i would definitely use this it saves time and energy it has different settings for suction and easy to clean
very happy  good quality  packaging and product quick delivery
for the money its really worth it plus more ive not had any issues with it and ive had it for a year it helps so much
i followed the instructions and this product seemed to help my slow kitchen drain  it has been about two weeks now since i finished using it and everything seems to be working well i will get more and use it as maintenance to keep my drain clear i really liked that it was so easy to use and each dose was in its own bottle so all i had to do was shake it and pour the liquid down the drain no mixing or measuring
ive went through about 4 foot spa machines and this by far is the best and i will surely keep it is big enough space for my husband who is a size 11 and he says he still has a lot of room second i love the remote control and drain something ive not really considered and am glad i got this honestly i got this on a whim thinking id just return it if i end up not liking it did not read that it had a remote lol as you see in the video it works so hooray the drain is kinda slow but dont let that stop you if spillage is your concern this drains slowly and no spills third the heater works unlike some that only retain the heat this one really heats up the water for you i know because i put cold tap water and heated it to 40 fourth i loooove the rollers at the bottom this made filling up and then moving it near the couch so easy no carrying for me less mess less spillage fifth the cover and the tools that came with it they are useful bonuses if you are like me who like to keep things dust free the cover is something that you will surely appreciate and of course the tools at first i didnt use them but they helped to get the smaller areas of my husbands feet i dont know how to use all of them but im sure they will all play a role someday lol overall recommend steep price but it isnt your regular foot spa it is worth it i promise
very comfortable to wear they really are as comfortable as a pair of glasses even with a shield attachedunfortunately there is such a gap on each side i would not wear this without a mask underneath these face shields would be useful if you are only expecting something to splatter right between your eyes or in the exact middle of your face nowhere elseso these are fine depending on the level of protection youre looking forthe shields attach with a pulloff tape that sticks to the eyeglass portion
i like that it has a backlight for easy reading it is also quite accurate
these masks are soft and comfortable to wear but i wear eyeglasses and these masks do nothing to prevent fogging when you are wearing the mask although the fabric is 2 ply your breath freely passes through the fabric and causes instant eyeglass fogging whenever the temperatures are cool since i live in minnesota cold temperatures are a constant issue very disappointed i expected more from this purchase
this toothbrush is just ok rated 3 stars the toothbrush base itself feels very lightweight and cheap the heads are very hard to get on and the bristles feel pretty cheap and soft the toothbrush does have a few different types of modes of vibration patterns but im not sure how that would benefit the user
they could be a little thicker so they hold the loop better
this is great for my contacts  i use it to rinse off the contact solution they stay in each night and i love being able to get 3 cans at once
disappointed and frustrated with myself for being fooled by great marketing blueberry bliss is actually soy and different kinds of sugar in a bar they taste just ok and are not a healthy alternative to other sweets just another bar full of soy and other crap dont waste your money nothing blissful about this bari hope ive finally learned my lesson most bars are junk
i have very dry skin and this cream works wonders lasts 24 hours on my body but due to washing my hands so much i have to reapply several times a day well worth the price
doesnt always give accurate numbers
we are enjoying this as a thickening agent from pudding to finger jello
bath wrap
super comfortable makes traveling long distances in the vehicle much less painful for my hips and sacroiliac joints i love it my husband tried the cushion and enjoyed it so much that he wanted one now he loves his too
i love that they wont able to slide off my glasses
this is a white noise sound machine with a total of 6 sounds it sits up like an alarm clock i love that it is battery operated i charged it overnight this comes with a usb cable not the typical micro usb perhaps type c the unit itself and an instruction pamphlet operation is simple as per my video press and hold the onoff button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off  rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook thunder white noise wave wind and bonfire all but one sound is pure annoying noisethe timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off it means the timer is offthere is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on the nightlight button is in the center top there are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light  the first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial the second press turns on one side of dots then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off the next press keeps all the dots lit this is what they call breathing lightsthe volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volumethe current price of 1619 2699 minus 40 would be extremely reasonable for this if i liked it but i do not it has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights i like the look of this and that it is battery operated i also like the simple operation however the two most important features nightlight and sound are lackluster in my opinion
these bars literally make you forget youre eating them for energy  they taste more like a snack food but they work wonders  the variety pack is a great way to try new flavors too
one pair actually went too far into my ear was able to get it out with tweezer the bigger set does not block out most noise
this works like a dream simple perfect curls but there is a huge problem it doesnt stay charged to curl your whole head i got a little over halfway done and the battery died it was only on for about 20 minutes who has time to stop and recharge halfway through styling so sad because it works great but the battery dying is unacceptable
gets the job done and the spray smells wonderful nice microfiber towel too  youll definitely want this product to keep your yoga mat clean
good for my yard waste
excellent bee pollen good to eat by the spoonful if you can afford it very satisfying if it was half the price i would add it to half my dishes
i bought this unit because i have a lot of shoulder and neck pain this is my second tens unit and it is definitely better than the first one i had i am very nearsighted and 70 years old and i can easily read the screen on this one i dont have to get out my magnifying glass to read the screen  which is very important when youre uncomfortable  and trying to get some reliefit arrived packaged very well as you can see from the video i attached and even fits back into the box which is unusual i will keep this unit and a few pads and the manual in the enclosed pouch and store it right by my recliner that way i can keep the box in my closet and just have the tidy pouch sitting right by my chair where i need it i usually use the pads for 30 minutes and find that my neck and shoulders are much improved the pads stay sticky after many uses so this unit will be by my side for a long time my sister tried it out  i was so impressed she pulled out her phone and ordered one right from the recliner this saves me a lot of trips to the chiropractor and lot of copays  it definitely pays for itself quickly it was an excellent purchase
the low pressure from this replacement renders  the machine uselessupdate within 3 months of purchasing the bigger side button sticks which most certainly renders the machine useless
this doesnt smell as strong as some others but it is a large quantity of eucalyptus oil for the price
we live in savannah georgia this is the only thing that keeps the bugs sand gnats away it is little oily but it works
great price works as expected
the opening isnt as wide as expected  i would look elsewhere if you are looking for a toenail cutter for thick nails  i will have to keep looking
great product i thought the bottle was glass not plastic but i love that its not easy to break and looks very expensive easy to swallow
these dont work as well as i remember them working as a kid but does the job 12 even 14 tablet works just as well as a whole fun for the kids but i wont order them again  not worth the price
this was a test with something i am not real femilure with  not a product for me but i have seen my mom use them before
used them when i had to stand for a long time  helps my feet a lot
the vitamin c in these gummies is ascorbic acid and scientific research says thats not really vitamin c  i think the best ingredient in these gummies is the zinc  zinc is a good at helping the immune system to fight off cold viruses  these gummies taste great and i could eat the entire bottle in one sitting if i didnt exercise control but im not too keen on the vitamin c source
great product and reasonable price for the quality
love that this is compostable  gets way more junk out of my teeth than glide floss tmi i know
they might have more omega3s but its really hard to see any actual effect vs other pills  these arent quite as big as some but not as small as others
perfect for icing my lower back when inflamed with arthritis
very thin do not fit well
these panties are hands down the most comfortable undies ive owned period the sizing is perfect and they dont ride up or down ever  you can tell these are qualitymade panties as the texture feels sturdy yet they are incredibly soft to touch i can tell they will last also another great feature about these panties is that they dont show the panty line when youre wearing tight pants for such comfortable wear you will not look like youre wearing granny pantiesi bought these for 3990 and it appears the price has gone down a bit  now 3690 but i will definitely be purchasing another pair here in a couple of months

lets face it unlike men it can be difficult for a woman to go to the bathroom outside we purchased some acreage and needed something that would be easy to use with our luggable loo this product was convenient and did a pretty good job controlling waste smell
these clippers are sold under various brand names but have one thing in commonthey do the job regular clippers that are of the same design always used to scare me because for what ever reason they were too imprecise and often ended up cutting into the nails quick and frankly made me avoid clipping my nails until they were past due eventually i gave up using clippers and just used the scissors in my swiss army knife which lead to imprecise cuts that needed filing to look acceptable but at least they didnt draw blood  thick solid build that made me realize just how cheaply regular clippers were stamped out the cutting edges are precisely machined and in the 8 years i have owned them there is no perceived dulling of the cutting edges  the product should last a life time  a lot of time i have just held them and admired how precisely they were built and how attractive the results were i own both sizestoenaillarge and fingernailsmall and find the small size hard to to get a firm grip oni would recommend caution about  the small size regardless of your finger size and opt for the large regardless for both toe and fingernails the only thing approaching second rate is the brand name decal stuck in the indentation the clippers themselves should have green bell stamped on back they sold as seki edge but are the same green bell clippers
had difficulty finding in retail stores pleased to have found it online really good product and easy to use no harsh chemical smell and easy to rinse off leaving no residue
not worth it at all its as if i didnt use anything yes it was on taught and tight no as you can see it let water in and soaked the  gauze that was covering the stiches that i had to keep dry
product as described i have straight super fine long hair it takes a while to detangle even with this brush i wouldnt say its a miracle but its better than yanking through with a traditional brush
i was very dissapointed  for the last year all i have heard is that wraps and herbal gels are the best thing since sliced bread  well i was not impressed  i applied the herbal body wrap gel sold by forever young to my thighs and arms  the amazon ad said to just apply the gel to targeted areas  well i did  i did twice a day  i did this for a week  nothingi was using this as a jumpstart to my new yoga and new lifestyle  i know nothing is a golden pill to a perfect body but seriously i did expect somethingdisclosure  i purchased this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback  the above review is my opinion
great product  ive ordered this product several times for my great uncle who brushes his teeth too hard
i like ked this bottle but after using it on my glasses it seems to quit working so i thought it was a glass cleaner never said that so i cleaned my glasses first and spray lasted about 34 hours nice convienant bottle
i love this
i love my hot heart massager its reusable and remains ready to use until you flex the internal metal button the solution inside then crystallizes producing heat in the process the heart remains flexible even after the crystals have formed making it suitable for hot massage
fit true to sizegreat quality comfortable non fading good pricegoid timing but after wearing 4 times started to see holes in leg area disappointed
this twopack glove set is well made comfortable and durable the blue pair has a thin flocked lining that feels soft against my skin and the unlined gloves are very durable i feared they may be too short to reach the bottom of a 5gallon bucket but they are plenty long and end about 3 below my elbow the size medium was a perfect fit and even though they are thicker gloves they are still flexible and tactile i recommend these
there are 30 shiny gold boxes that are perfect for christmas gifts cookies cupcakes or other classy but lightweight gifts they come in one piece and unfold easily into a reasonablysized box the bottom is interlocking and just unfolds easily into place each box should be able to fit about one to two pounds of cookies depending on the size of the cookie i can even get an appropriatelysized tiny cake in this box overall i think these are classy and wellmade but they are thinner than i expected therefore these are for lightweight items only also i would recommend using tissue paper or foil on the bottom before using to carry treats to stabilize the box a bit the current price of 1799 is competitive as it comes to 60 cents each box
this summer my pops ended up looking like rudolph the red nose reindeer from the weightfriction of his glasses luckily these were available  i got em for him hes now back to his normal grouchy self minus the red nose
this shake tasted horrible i tried mixing it with different things to mask the flavor but it not help
the stool is very easy to assemble it rolls very easily over either floors or carpets the cushion is comfy i read some reviews complaining of its longevity i hope mine holds up for a long time
convenient way to store  protect credit cards from fraud  easy push button opener  fits all my cards and slides easily into my pocket or purse  peace of mind

i love swanson products and this is a mainstay in our home for things like poison ivy prevention or treatment certain pain etc  do a search on rhus tox and what it is all for
wholly jumpin judas does regular tissues after a couple of days of runny nose tear the space between your nose holes as raw as a bad fitting sneakers in a marathon a couple days of sniffles is endurable but that raw skin under your nose laststhese are the genuine best solution ive found do yourself a big favor with these
love this brand and their beautiful designsgood pricing great quality too this is my third pair
wonderful or someone like me who uses them each morning i have a box in every room in my house couldnt  live without them on hand
well one size will fit most skinny people i doubt thesewill accomodate plus sizes or curvy figures that being said they are nicely made the waist band is wide and textured the insides are soft fleece while the exterior is smooth they do stretch but not far they are form fitting but comfortable instructions say to hand wash not in this lifetime i laundered in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle turned out fine
blocks out all light but does not stop sounds completely
we have been using happy bowls for the last couple of years and we wouldnt go camping without them  these are the best invention since sliced cheese
hii purchased a large container of berry lemonade i do like it i only wish i know the source of color its blue id prefer a more natural color
i have been taking this liquid vitamin daily and at first the taste is not great at all you eventually get used to the taste after a few days i have already noticed an increase in my energy level since taking this
i thought the smell was awful my three kids tasted it and they all hated it they usually love this kind of stuff i give them lemonflavored liquid fish oil which they love and it looks like well continue with thatmade with algae and it smells and tastes like it the citrus flavor only seems to make it worse
these are very soft and comfortable i have wide hands and did not feel any restriction wearing them i was able to keep them on all night the gloves and ancient greek remedy oil helped my winter beaten cooking cleaning hands in one night better than any daytime hand cream that really doesnt fix the damaged skin
simple to use easy to clean  unfortunately it uses a lot of water to create the vacuum so thats a downside  i could use siphoning as a means to change water in my tank but the distance to the sink from my tank is 30 feet so its a little difficult to make it happen easily but could be in the future because of the water usage
i love this soaker so much that i purchased more for family members
im older and have some recurring pains  my right shoulder is the worst  it is part of carpal tunnel syndrome from typing most of my life  some days my right shoulder feels like concrete has been poured in the joints making my shoulder heavy and hard to move plus painful  i place a pad on the front just above my armpit and then one pad on the back usually around the outer edge of the shoulder blade  i could attach two more pads but usually two is enough  i then choose a pattern strength and time and let the tens unit do the rest  the electrical charge that passes aroundthrough the muscle mass in that area does help to ease the stiffness and pain  i cant say how much this helps me  all i can say is that it does help and is a great way to relieve pain without using drugs
was great but some of the letters did not have a valve to put air in so we could not blow up
perfect weight and good quality
ive had trouble making fermented vegetables w just sea salt so wanted to try a culture  my veggies turned out great with this culture will be making more soon
its ok but my hair dye was too thick  i couldnt use the bottle normallykind of expensive
it works great for scrubbing but the 360 swivel action has a mind of its own  it does not stay in a locked position
blended well into my smoothies not much taste difference with the other vegetables and things
more of a dull gold vs bright gold
this japanese style bench is a great addition to my bathroom i love the ease of sitting under the shower and washing my legs and feet and not having to worry about balancing myself get one i think you will be very happy with this purchase
i love this dental floss and i cant find it anywhere locally i hope they havent stopped making it already this is the same kind my dentists office gives me a sample of each time i go in for cleaning its the only floss that i can get comfortably in between my teeth
all natural formula each serving contains 40 billion cfu a serving is 2 capsules  they promise a minimum potency of 20 billion could by the expiration date theres 60 capsules in the bottle the probiotics strains listed there are 4 of them seem to be similar to others with names like bifidobacterium andclactobacillus etc the difference in this product being the macktrek bipass technology which appears to refer to the specific blend and how it survives into your system the capsules are easy to swallow gel caps and theyre defined as shelf stable the bottle i got has an expiration date approximately 5 months from when i received them
our carafe was a nasty mess inside but no more this product is easy to use and extremely effective
used this to make my vanilla love this stuff best vanilla ever would buy again
i like this product works well
as expected but cant hang on the side of a wheelchair because its too long and rubs against the wheel
product description was incorrect on size  was not even close on fitting
not sure why anyone would buy any others on here that do not have the correct ingredients spending money for no impact on whatever health issues you are having this is really good and comes with instructions on how to brew it it works
these little cord locks make all the difference in mask fitting and comfort  i use a tiny crochet hook to slip them on to the cord  i make masks and people like this option on them
a very close personal friend of mine has recently lost a few of her furry kids that she has had for around 15 years she has been really heart broken and it doesnt help that she has a few more kitties around the same age she does cat rescue and even though she has several other kitties she takes it very hard when she loses 1 of her beloved petsshe doesnt have any children of her own so her animals are her babies she also lost her beloved father a few years ago so she has had her share of sadness so i have been thinking about making her a bracelet that would have  charms to do with cats and dogs and maybe something to do with her dad kind of like a remembrance braceletthis wing charm is perfect to add to my remembrance braceletthis is the  flora mcqueen personalized guardian angel wing charm birthstone charms mother bracelet charm fmc2001by anmaoprosthe wing meansgauadian angelnickel freestainless steelso it wont rusthole size is 48 mm to 5 mmeco friendlyhypoallergeniccomes with a gift bagfits pandora braceletsconsabsolutely nonei received this product to test  for free and i was only asked to give my honest opinion i did not receive any type of compensation for doing so all opinions are my own or that of my husband if he helped me to test it if i have a change of mind after i have tested it longer i will come back and update my review whether good or bad
the picture is not what i got i got the short ones with the pointed end which are much poorer quality than the ones in the photo with the squared end
i bought these for cleaning out little things around the house that you couldnt get a cloth inside they are very handy
the product is awesome but the sellers sometimes cut the fabric into multiple pieces giving you a small cloth to use be careful
i ordered the wrong size so i cannot tell you how well they work or dont work i will have to wait to get a new grandbaby to find out i will update when i can test them
well made sturdy and easy to use the doors open in the same direction making it easier to get out pills  the boxes are the largest ive seen  only problem is that the pills can get stuck in groove between am and pm boxes but each row can be lifted out easily to get the pills out of the groove
solid construction and efficient this ear and nose trimmer does a nice job of trimming without any pulling or risk of injury its not terribly loud either recommended
got since we have cats i liked that it only needed changed once a year and with just a light bulb with the litter boxes i was hoping it would help with any smell one of my cats also has asthma so hoped it would help her not sure it has really helped with any of that and have one in each room i do not like that they added a coupon into each box and said for your purchases you would get this credit though it wasnt for each one and only for one yet put one in each box and didnt say for only one on them so didnt like the false advertising included wouldnt of bothered to enter all of them if it would of stated that
wasnt a very noticeable change
hear these are just the best to use grabbed 3 packs
i believed this may help with leg crampsnot so sure  i didnt notice any wow effect
great deal good price and good quality will definitely purchase again
more than likely if you are using this you are under the care of a doctor  it is a fabulous dressing although admittedly expensive  i wish mine lasted several days but a day is all i see to be able to get out of them before they need to be changedit is good that there is no adhesive border  wounds are typically irregular in shape and the entire area most be covered  if you can not find one large enough you can use two together  if there was an adhesive border it would then stick to the wound which would be harmful  it is much easier to use your own adhesive which you know will not irritate your skin  as my skin is easily irritated it is necessary i use an adhesive for fragile skin and many of the adhesive borders already in place end up damageing my skin
these makeup remover pads are nice because they have a white side and a black side the black side is best for removing makeup and the white side is best for applying toner or whatever you use i have other white ones that are totally stained with makeup even after being washed a dozen times they are made of 70 bamboo and 30 cotton and come with a bag to wash make sure you tie that bag tight before machine washing or you will be spilling cotton pads everywhere i did notice that the panda on the front of the packaging is the exact same logo as the wwf panda named chi chi and im sure that panda logo has a copyright
works well does what is says and helps keep you feeling clean an dry
i needed something to keep my medical stuff in at home  this is holding 2 bp machines o2 meter glucometer in the outer pockets plus a few other things  i like to be organized and have like things together  im happy that all my medical equipment is together in one bag
i love these very clean eating and easy to transport because they do not melt in the heat i carry one with me at all times
if you need noise cancellation dont waste money in this the silicone plugs well you can hear the same having them on or not how it is even possible it doesnt matter the shapes colors nada having this things in the ear canal is like having earwax but you can still hear with this ones insidethe waxy stuff almost the same as the regular foamy onesi will keep trying to find some noise cancellation earplugs
i have alot of black hate those little fuzz balls and an a animal that sheds constantly i do love my dog lol  i have used lint rollers also the little gagets that are battery operated takes forever and really doesnt do the trickthis is great for heavy material like hoodies sweatshirts and leggings  i wouldnt recommend on material that snags best lint and little fuzz removal but the trick for me hold the material taunt
ive tried laser treatment on my legs recently so i had to shave my legs with razor few days later new hairs showed up they were not too long for waxing treatment thats why ive decided to try an epilator honestly i was very skeptical because i couldnt believe that epilator can catch such small hairs but it did i will post before and after pictures so you can see how clear my leg was after using this epilator just for a few seconds it removed my short hairs with the roots im impressed definitely will be using it it is lightweight so i will be taking it with me when traveling
very clingy truly grabs onto whatever it is being wrapped aroundonto including itself be carefulthe material is thin i have used other compostable cling wrap and this is the thinnest i have usedcomes with a slider cutter that you have to attach to box for use in cutting sheets of wrapa little tricky to dispense  cut  once i got a piece off the roll i was able to effectively wrap some food it was while it is still on the roll and trying to get some off that is slightly problematic for me perhaps with more use i will get the hand of it if you can get a whole sheet off then know that whatever you wrap this will provide a good seali find that the compostable wrap is much more clingy than regular cling wraps and for that i will likely continue with buying compostable cling wrap this is about what i expected and works pretty well however  i prefer this brand httpswwwamazoncomdpb08xvswfz2more pricy though354 stars
its ok it works alright but it is not powerful at all  that part of the description is deceiving
these are very good shoe insert insoles i have small narrow feet and i was able to place these inside my flats with no issue i did have to cut the inserts to fit correctly in my shoes but other than that they are very comfortable and keep my heels from hurting as they did before they provide the perfect amount of cushion in my shoes without making them feel funny on my feet it was very hard trying to shape with scissors so that it didnt hurt the area under my toes but in the end it worked out overall great insoles and great size after adjustment cuttingi received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
bought this more for the scent profile than the germ fighter aspect i saw that it was fine for use around pets when used as directed which is also why i was keen on getting it i have 2 labs and 3 cats so it is important that i use products that are not going to harm them i like freshening up my carpet so i figured i would give this a tryfor pet owners  sprinkle on carpets wait 15 minutes vacuum then keep pets off of carpet for an additional 30 minutes after that i didnt realize that second part is needed until i read the directions i failed to see that when i was looking at the product description it is there so just know to add in the additional timeit smells really good very fine particulates be sure to follow directions with pets for added precaution i am using this in  areas that are well ventilated and not in direct sleeping spots
time will tell on the effectiveness but as of now not much difference in how i feel
i think that it helps my sleep and cools my body temperature down
seems to be helping so far
i only use this on my face
i used to love these energy drinks and have used them for years but i do not see myself repurchasing in the future they recently changed the formula and the flavor  i dont mind the flavor change even though it is not as good as it used to be  but the main difference is that these do not work the same for me as the original formula  from what i can tell they halved the amount of 34spike formula34 in the ingredients and changed around the order of the 34other ingredients34  it doesnt really matter since whatever they did it is not as effective now as it used to be which is a shame
so thick that it is unusable for me nothing like muro 128
i purchased the lavender scented spray and am delighted with the results i did a deepclean on my mat by spraying it down and letting it sit for 2 minutes then wiped it down with the microfiber cloth and let it sit dry overnight before rerolling the scent is pleasing and leaves the mat smelling fresh for a couple weeks if you are sensitive to scents i would purchase the unscented version easy to use and the ingredients are safe this bottle will last you a long time even with daily use
i already have previous sport elite model and got one because of new tens added it is a great function and i expect the best great service from the buyer and good price thanks
i dont know how anyone who gave this a positive review was able to insert them into the ear at all the material is very flimsy and they collapse at the slightest amount of pressure after 30 minutes of fumbling i gave them to the flight attendant to put in the garbage theyre worthless stick with the putty type which always stay in place and block all sound the only reason i tried them was that theyre in a smaller case than what i currently use caveat emptor
received items in crushed box all tissue boxes inside crushed still usable too much trouble to return very disappointed in packaging
theses pills work very well to help with my inflammationi did have an issue when i opened the package some got on my quartz countertop and it seemed like it was going to stain it but since it was quartz i was able to remove it had the countertop been granite it might have stained iti have also noticed that my urine is more yellow after taking these than any other turmeric pillspills are easy to swallow without any after taste
sometimes these things are good sometimes there not its always hit or miss when ordering these rollers
this machine is a good foot spa but it is a bit small for my taste i am a man and men tend to sit with their legs slightly apart if that is the case with you this unit will become annoyingly small after using it for a while
very good quality scale
i completed the full bottle of pills and my conclusion is that this product did nothing i consider myself a biohacker and i am in tune with how my body responds perhaps the effect is masked by all the other supplements and peptides i take i tried to isolate the effect from my other supplements and energy drinks i tried taking more than the recommended dose taking it spread throughout the day taking it in the evening in addition to recommended three pills at onceif this supplement does anything it is too subtle for me to notice some supplements and medications take time to build up before their effect becomes noticeable but i did not notice anything from this at any time during the month i was hoping this would work since the company seems wellintentioned with a belief that what they are selling worksthis is clearly not a stimulant anything that is a stimulant is more immediately effective than this productthe clinical trials are meaningless if they used a placebo as a comparison they should be comparing competing products such as caffeine adderall ritalin and modafinil all of these competing drugs are less expensive than this supplement excluding the cost of the doctors visit to get the prescription the real challenge for supplements like these is how it stacks up against caffeine or a monster energy drink not a sugar pillpeople that are avoiding stimulants are not going to eat cocoons either products like this target the fringe of biohackers who already take numerous other supplements and are not nutrient deficient in anything the target audience is different from a clinical trial groupthe main compound adding to the cost is the peptide for brainenhancing peptides semax and cerebrolysin are established proven and scientifically validated peptides and both work great in me and have noticeable effects i am not sure what cocoon peptide is supposed to do and the web site of the vendor does not mention how it works what is the mechanism of action the other peptides i mentioned increase bdnf levels and are less expensive than this producti am a man in my 40s and i have tried a large number of supplements nootropics medications and peptides to help increase productivity focus and mental performancethe moneybackguarantee helps for a product like this but it seems like you will need to take a test at the start of the 30 days to activate the offer
this slip resistant tray worked wonders while my boyfriend had knee surgery now my dad uses it as a lap tray
great samples from great companies  love it
i am very happy with the small size of these capsules the extra fruit and veggies added into my day to day is fantastic i was nervous they would be too big especially since these capsules always float and mess with my headability to swallow pills but they really are great
works great easy to set up its perfect
it worked really great and you can see the screen very clearly thats what got me was the brightness and clarity of the led screen i also like that it has usbc and it comes with a bag too nice
the orings wont stay on my glasses which defeats the purpose of using them tossed them out
love the color and beads at the end i use them to store my jewelry and the bags are durable
this is a great supplement for lowering blood sugar and aiding digestion you dont need to go to strange lengths to take it its not meant to taste like fruit you dont need to hide it in smoothies or soup just add 14 tsp of this into a small cup of warm water 2 times a day and drink its not going to taste delicious but its really just like a slightly bitter tea if youre used to herbal remedies you wont be phased by this if youre used to gummy vitamins you probably wont like it
these are very tasty
i bought these to help make stacked cakes these did the job well
i put it on and have not taken it off love this
fantastic upscale great packaging great instructing well made silicon with 2 stoppers one w elongated loop and one flat insert nice cover microwavable and they stay warm best of all is the modest size perfect for so many applications i bought 2 and prefer these to all others im going to give the plastic set to the pets for warmth these surpass all other hot water bottles and what a bargain price for the high end product

what i dislike is that the balls have to be charged after every washing there is no scent and its good for sensitive skin the freshness is there but only after the balls have been sanitized in direct sunlight also it really doesnt kill odors as strongly as i would have liked
i dont know what it is but it seems like he is not real i dont like it
solimo petroleum jelly white petrolatum skin protectant soothes and protects skin by creating a protective moisture barrier helps provide relief for dry skin and helps protect minor burns wind burn and chapping
item arrived exactly as described this is a highquality item that is definitely reusable for multiple occasions i used this as a backdrop along with some other wall decorations
i appreciate the price as well as the product and i continue to come back to it each time i run out
this product did not work could not get it to turn on cheaply made
i am in no way skilled at using a curling iron with that said after getting used to the longer barrel it was surprisingly easy to get nicer looking waves and curls where i want them my hair is naturally curly with a lot of body but my natural curls are unruly this has helped tamed my usual nightmare and i love the results this iron is value priced and i hope it holds up well enjoying thus so far
i have a couple of shoes that rub bunions  it works as advertised  i have also used it to keep sticky zippers working
im used to the crappy foam earplugs for everything and these are my first earplugs of this kind wow what a difference this reduces the overall noise level to protect your hearing yet you can still hear with enough definition to have a conversation with someone and understand what they are saying assuming theyre speaking loudly of course with the other kind everything sounds muffled so you cant really do that added bonus these are so comfortable ive never worn earplugs as comfortable as these theres no pressure or ear ache at all best earplugs ive ever used no wonder they have a special little carrying case
i really like this brush for my dog the handle is very comfortable to hold i was using a toddler size toothbrush on my dog but this toothbrush is so much easier to hold and makes cleaning my dogs teeth a little bit easier
this stuff is good it makes my contacts feel more comfortable and certainly keeps them cleaner but this stuff is so damned expensive it probably cost pennies to make and they run up the price because they have market share with the way you have to use the product you run out of it super quickly and realize youve just blown 15 on a few weeks worth of contact cleaner crazy
not as good as an alcohol based cleaner 420 cleaner better 10x
will not stay in place on back on chair
excellent product just what i needed petroleum jelly
works when in but not great as goes off tooquickly
works really well
i used to have one of these mops when they first came out it was one of the as seen on tv versions this is the best mop hands down it literally picks up every micro dust of hair or debris that is on your floor if you have pets or get a lot of dust in your area this is definitely the mop you want to have
while installing this generally involves finding the right spot in your ducting especially if you have a humidifier cutting a hole and wiring it up its easier said than done  you likely will need a drill dremel andor snips and most folks dont mess with their ducting much the video provided by the vendor is a bit misleading as you generally cannot just drill through drywall to install  if you know someone who does itll likely be easy for them  the brightness of the bulbs makes it hard to qc things as you cannot easily tell theyre on without being blinded by severely unhealthy light  i actually had welders goggles handy which helped a lot  the unit does have indicators on the outside but if you want to verify things while setting it all up be carefulin the end it all works  it was easier to install than a whole home humidifier but more difficult than many home improvement projects
they are helping especially with crampsin my feet
been diagnosed with gastritiscolitis and use for those issues wow im impressed every day im a little less severe they had me on famotidine for over a year and this did more for me than that in 1 week note i take 5 pellets
its perfect i love it  its sturdy and very good looking i had bought a very inexpensive folding cane that was noisy
im kind of between a 6 and a 6 12 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose  these pads help with the 6 12 for the ones that are a little loose adds a bit more comfort for long wear
i am pleased with this sensitive toothpaste i have been using it for the past week and it has kept my sensitive teeth feeling good it has a nice flavor not as minty as my previous sensitive toothpaste but very pleasant and light it foams nicely without being too foamy i have not had any pain in my teeth since i began using it i already used a sensitive toothpaste before this one however switching over has not caused me any problems i like the consistency of the toothpaste it is a normal toothpaste consistency and is not watery at all

it is difficult to keep your teeth dry to put on the whitener
velcro is very itchy and irritating for clientsbuy the drawstring type sooo much better  jmt beauty soft black french terrycloth spa wrap w drawstring  stopper
this stuff is delicious i dont know why every shake powder has to be chocolate vanilla or berry or those hypersweetened flavors so this one is a great option if you just want a tasty shake that tastes like oatmeal delicious i wish the carbs were lower but i mitigate that by using unsweetened  flax  soy  almond milk or a green juice spinach lemon apple carrot and it makes it very balanced
perfect product for what we needed them for i scooped ice cream into each one fed a straw and a spoon into the slot of each lid and put them all in the freezerat party time we scooped ice into the tub i had them in everyone could choose their own flavor soda to pour over the ice cream in their cup and each person got to have an easy no mess ice cream soda it couldnt have worked better thanksmy only complaint is that the lids stuck together really badly and took me forever to separate some of them
mediocre sallys has stronger files will stick to those
i am using this powder on my dog  its a great product  it helped heal his wound  but my vet warned me about using it on him if he licks an area  the zinc in the product is toxic to dogs  so i stopped using it because he is always licking on the wounded area
lots of dental floss so i wont have to order it again in the near future also prime free two day shipping to my front door what more could you ask for the floss is fairly thin which i wanted so i could floss in between a  couple really tight teeth i have the flavor is subtle mint and at 55 yards one container has plenty of floss to last two months by those calculations this order should cover one person for an entire year of daily flossing using just under 3 feet of floss each time
this is an easy way to get the b12 taken but be very sure you realize that it contains fifty thousand percent of the daily suggested need this could cause a problem
im pregnant and have an indoor cat her litter tray is in our small bathroom i needed something to aid in cleaning bacteria in the air after 2 days using this device it appears to be working well in our bathroom over the kitty litter within 6 hours you could tell it has cleaned the stale air scooping the poop out of the kitty litter as quickly as possible and flushing it is advisable i like the devise but will also continue to clean the bathroom with bleach as well
i thought these might be heavy and that the edges of the rings would be scratch but neither is the case it lis wellmade and lays very lightly on my neck nor does it pull down hanging it places my glasses mibreastbone which is remarkably comfortable for me i also bought the hearts but havent worn those yet
i liove this oil i use it daily on my face i mix my favorite essential oils in with it it absorbs quickly and leaves my face so soft i use a combo of this and pomegranate seed oil no more expensive day or night creams for meand ive gotten compliments on how nice my skin looks
it is an easy way to ingest superfood and i use this with my smoothie  i kinda throw in a lot of super food related powder in my smoothies  with regards with this product  it does not have a strong over riding flavor  which is great as i prefer to taste the fruitsvegetables  this is a great supplement if you are working out a lot as it is hard to replace nutrients lost from ordinary food without adding a lot of calorieslove that it is fresh and sealed well to keep the product fresh  i would buy this product again
i love vital proteins so when i saw that they came out with a collagen whey i had to have it i ordered the banana cinnamon and vanilla flavor and i was so excited to try it right away when it arrived the taste and the texture of this new product is almost unbearable i used the suggested serving size with the appropriate amount of liquid and it tastes so watered down and gritty i have to take it in several shots to finish it in the future i will stick to the original nonflavored collegen protein it was worth a try but definitely not what i expected
why not eat the super fruit itself
really like the double compartments  i wish it wasnt quite as deep as i cut tiny oblong pills and its hard to get it situated in the groove with that depth
cats in the microwave  cats in the fridge got this as a joke because it turns out my real cat is terrified of a hot water bottle jokingly got this as a maybe if he thinks its another cat it will be ok turned out to be non scary to real cats and the cutest hot water bottle imaginable
i have very sensitive skin and a lot of things irritate it so im always worried when i try something new i spot test and wait spot test and wait this product doesnt irritate my skin first winning feature its a milky toner which made me wonder but its moisturizing and balancing it feels nice allows me to skip additional moisturizing normal combination skin and leaves my skin clear and bright love this product and will buy more when this bottle is used up absolutely no irritation
i have worn these for years and am finally taking the time to write a review my podiatrist recommended them as a first step in treating a nasty case of plantar fasciitis that i acquired from running around barefoot for a production i also work as a nurse and am on my feet for 12 hours walking an average of 10000 steps or more at work these were a miracle it took time for the plantar fasciitis to heal but these accelerated that process if i wear shoes without them or run around the house too long barefoot it tries to flare again if i behave myself and wear these in my shoes i am completely pain free  ive learned my lesson the hard way
the nipple suckers do not work well at all the syringe is not strong or long enough to get the suction needed for those with truly inverted nipplesthe nipple correctors work but the surface area is way too large and definitely intended for someone with big nipples if your nipples are smaller itll hurt a lot more than necessaryid only recommend the nipple correctors and only for those with large nipples id say honestly to look for another brand myself i wasnt too impressed
got these for my sister who relies on those cheapo dollar store things and youd have thought i sent her a bad of gold her reaction was so great on these  she says they are super well built and optically obviously superior over what shes been using  and has had a couple of compliments on the way they look too
purchased for my grandkids and they they elderberry syrup year round they stay pretty healthy too
great extra grainy will file thick nails no need for extra pressure on thin nails or even thick very durable files
did absolutely nothing for me  wouldnt stay on my foot  returned
i consulted with my internist and endocrinologist before i started taking this i was very happy that they thought adding this supplement to my daily regimen would be greatly beneficial to my health this supplement is a well balanced mix of essential vitamins and minerals that helps with the quality of my health and immune system i am in my mid thirties and i am noticing that the overall quality of my health and well being is just not the same anymore to make things worse i have several health conditions that i have been suffering from for years now i started taking this supplement together with other natural vitamins that complement its benefits it is made from superior ingredients and in my opinion it is well priced two thumbs up for this brandi received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes regardless i only recommend products or services i use personally and believe will be good for others i refuse to review or endorse products that i have not or will not personally try needless to say i may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things i say on my reviews are made up or fake  they are all based on my experiences with whatever product i am reviewing im just a regular consumer and i appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying my views and opinions are from a customerend users standpoint
if you buy empty capsules you can make your own capsules to swallow and save yourself the bitterness of this powder i do not plan on purchasing capsules so i will mix with my manuka honey and water and drink it down this is supposed to be great and i am going to believe in that as i drink each glass
have not used that much and went to use it today and it gave an error which i think is associated with the band not inflating
3 stars for whitening  i only used it twice and not sure yetit does however have a very minty sent  love that it comes with 2 me and my husband are giving it  a try update a month later i have not used it continuously so i cant say but even just the 1 time using it it works decent i have to say i was pretty suprised
i bought this as an xmas gift for my girlfriend  she loves it  its tracking her her young son and myself now and we have it tied into each of our fitbit accounts  i also tricked my mother and sister into buying one for each other for xmas  hopefully this will inspire them to take charge of their fitness moving forward
i use baby oil mainly to remove eye make up it is less expensive  does a better job than the make up wipes ive tried this also works well as a body moisturizer when applied after bathing will definitely buy again
works well great price i am a nurse practitioner and this is easy to use and accurate i recommend for anyone who needs to monitor their bp
amazing absorption yet very gentle on painful wounds
love these pads help with pain on knees and hips
it works fine when your banana fits but beware that the ribs do not allow it to flex more than a few degrees contrary to what i assumed from the photos so if your bananas curvature doesnt fit the narrow limits of the molded shape you are out of luck also really long bananas will not fitone thing that is not apparent from the photo is that both ends are open which is a good thing for airflow and to let the stem stick out saving internal space
i thought these caps would be a soft silicone that would stretch to fit over the heel but theyre hard plastic and were way too big for my stiletto on my wedding day my bridesmaids had to wrap my heels in toilet paper to wedge these caps onto the shoe they might fit a thicker pump style heel but they are far from a universal fit
ive always made it a point to clean my dogs teeth since its good for them and dental cleanings are very expensive ive used dog toothbrushes and finger cloth brushes before but never a dual silicone finger setup like this i never cleaned the inside of the teeth but only the outer sides the dual finger brush does make it easier to clean the inside teeth and fortunately my dog is use to me having my fingers in her mouth im sure this might not work for many but it does work okay for me and my situation
been on this one week i think i need to be on it longer to see results but i dont feel as tired  im taking this as a result of dr recommendation
these generic oral b compatible toothbrush replacement heads  4 brushes are good replacement toothbrush heads for the oralb battery operated toothbrush  i like them  good price
this product may be good for you but boy is it gross i usually have to mix it with some sort of juice to try and dilute it
works in a pinch
wonderful way to store multiple brushes  i wonder if they have a stand like this for dese razors
we like that it came with a glove to protect your hand from getting burned  it does warm up fairly quickmy daughter has long thick hair which made it time consuming to use this because we were worried about burning her hair if we kept it on one spot too long  you have to use it in very small sections of thin layers  the swivel cord made it easy to just angle and brush where she needed itoverall it works
they are a ok replacement in a pinch
had this for almost a month and is holding up great its stays put and has little ridges that help you not slip would be great for someone who is elderly for that reason and it looks very spalike as well
so i started using this benecol today  i will post update on my numbers in a few weeksbtw  great packing  arrived well packed in a small cooler with cold packs despite the temperature outside being in the 50s  appreciate the thoughtful packing
did not work for me and would make my heart race out of nowhere thats unusual because ive taken many diet pills in the past including ephedra and never had that problem once i discontinued use my heart stopped racing
i really liked this whole set i was out of helium so that was no fun i was only able to use a few of the balloons i couldnt get enough helium in the confetti filled balloons to get it to float it sank so it was just sitting on the table all in all the banner itself was totally worth it it was easy to thread the letters on to the string with the needle tool
i think these detergent sheets would be great for kids living in dorms at school or when you are taking lengthy trips somewhere but for home use id rather have my big jug of liquid laundry detergent  ive used several of these and they seem to clean clothes just fine and dont leave any perfume scent behind on them  however i have to use 3 sheets at a time since my laundry loads are big  at that rate i only get about 10 or 11 loads done and that just isnt all the economical since one box costs 1059  i can get a big jug of liquid for about that much money  all that said these clean fine are easy to carry especially good for those who cant carry much stuff and dont leave a perfume scent behind  these would be great for those with a very limited storage space in their laundry area
didnt bring back the black and remove scuff marks as well as i expected
quite an advantage when sitting for a prolonged period on hard surfaces not really 34soft34 but adds a lot of comfort as your weight seems more distributed and hence the 34nopressure34  it is very portable and works on many surfaces my wife sits on it when on a soft sofa and has significantly less lumbar pain  i have been using 2 different types of the horseshoe shaped chair cushions with the sacral cutouts for about 1 year  and find these to be amazing when sitting for long periods on a wooden chair but they are more rigid and do not quite distribute pressure like the purple to be honest i put the purple pad on the chair then the anatomically shaped butt cushion and together they are the ideal solution most comfortable sitting arrangement i have found ever
setup was a bit challenging but once i got past that i have loved this scale  it syncs without fail more reliably than my fitbit tracker and has held up fine despite occasionally being knocked over  it has traveled 1200 miles in the trunk of my car when i wanted to take it on a monthlong trip and is still no worse for wear  im not sure if the body fat percentage is accurate but the weight seems to be  another bonus is that this automatically updates on my fitness pal once it syncs
oh my on all things holy get thesethese are amazing i took a big whiff of the bag and it allowed me to breath better already but once you put it in your shower  i swear its like baby jesus himself came to rid me of my allergies  i can breathe yall i can really breathe
tangles after a while
i consume this cod liver for the vitamins a and d and the omega3 this batch wasnt as smelly as the first or im getting used to the fishy smell i still season the liver with a bit of lemon juice or vinegar to kill the smell even more bottom line nutritious seafood without the bones
very fast deliverystrong and durable at 4 mils not too thin and not too thick i am using these to organize my many jewelry beads and stones most of which are still in the mailers i expect to reduce my storage needs significantly
good product fast delivery
i have tried a few similar silicone face mask brackets and i feel that these really are the best what makes them stand apart from the rest is the silicone strap basically you are wearing 2 separate things  the bracket and your mask after nearly a year of wearing masks i have found these to be the most helpful when it comes to preventing my glasses to fog up the silicone is very soft and nonirritating the storage cases are an added bonus in my opinion love these
works ok maybe not as well as a cyptic pencil but also doesnt leave a black mark
meh it does the job ok but you have to clean it after every swipe and it gets tedious
i have used this brand and liked it for a long time  this purchase is because i can not get the large quanity refills a local stores
this toothpaste has an interest flavor never had a lemon mint toothpaste and its not bad it will probably grow on me more too one of the main reasons why i got this toothpaste was because the ingredients seemed better than conventional toothpaste although i didnt realize it contained silica never heard of it before either so i looked put up to see what it was i guess it is ok to use but i also read it could wear down your enamel so i dont think im going to be using this regularly just in case i may use it weekly or even biweekly the toothpaste doesnt foam up much which some people may not like besides the silica concern i like the toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean
very comfortable and has made my longer driving trips longer than 45 minutes much more tolerable arrived quickly this device really works
i hats flouride i go well out of my way to find flouride free products this is the best one so far it whitens like a lot of the other tooth pasted cant  it is travel size but a little goes a long way
this is colorful and lightweight keeps the sun off of my facei used some iron on hem tape to make it a bit smaller
my wife loves this
full disclosure yes im a very tall and heavy guy so this review may not apply to a lot of people  on the other hand im within the advertised rating for weight for this stool and my disability makes it a necessity to get around in my kitcheni had high hopes for this product  the same feature thick seat padding that makes this uncomfortable for me after prolonged use is also what makes it durable for my weightso thats an even trade  after all its a stool and not a recliner  im good with thatwhat im not happy about is that after just over two months of using for about 40 minutes a day a wheel fell off this morning and wouldnt snap back in again  then i was surprised to see that the sockets for the wheels to snap into are just molded plastic  one of the edges of that failed wheel socket had cracked  what a poor designgoing cheap like that instead of a few pennies to put metal inserts into the plasticive poured a bunch of thick super glue into the socket to see if that will work as a temporary fix until a new one can get here  yes im taking a chance on another one of the same type but i cant keep paying about 75 every two months to buy stools that i really need to have to lead a fairly normal life
this scale generally works okay but it seems to have a weird memory function for example ill take my weight and it will jump around pretty dramatically before jumping to a number then if i step on it again itll immediately go back to that same number as if it has a memory function in it then just to test it ill grab something else about a pound or so just to test it and itll still immediately jump to that same number this obviously makes me not trust the numbers
so far it is the best quality on the market for such affordable price i have combination acneprone skin and this has been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine i use it twice a day once in the evening when i shower also make sure you use the sponge everyday and keep it kind of wet so it will not dry and will last much longer i simply love it it has really made a difference in helping clear up my skin and keep it clear i love that it exfoliates without being harsh and i love that the sponge itself lasts for so long ive had mine for almost 2 weeks now and i will probably replace in a month or so i highly recommend giving this a try it has really helped me
cute but a bit misleading colors were onpoint size was not instructions were nonexisting
super cute bags i bought them for my med school friends graduation party and they were a hit they didnt lookfeel cheap or tacky and were the perfect size to fit some candies bandaids and bone shaped pens
seem to have a little more energy feel a little better maintain weight through christmas
perfect for the barber shop
ive used it for many years but a few years ago it disappeared from the drug store  grocery shelves  i dont know why but amazon continued to carry it  this last shipment came from india the cardboard boxes were all crushed but the tubes were just fine
th scouring pads are basically the same pads i usually buy i use them till they fall apart which takes about couple of months and i wash dishes very often new these seem fine scrub well leave dishes and surfaces clean it works for me
this 5 piece eye make up took kit is actually pretty nice the container it comes in is kind of just plain would love to see a design on it but the brushes work really welli tried out each brush and none of the bristles fell out they seem to be pretty durable strong and made of good quality materialthese would make a great little gift to your wedding party girls give one set out to each of the girls in your wedding party these would also be great for holiday present or birthday present wrap a nice little bow on it dress up the container with sequins overall i would say this brush set is a good quality product for the pricei received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review
after using the sponge for a couple weeks i can honestly say its one of those things that i didnt know i needed its really gentle on my skin and i love using it with my simple cleaner i was a little thrown off by the way it arrives it waschard textured like a rock but after running it under water it became very soft and luxurious feeling
i got a very strange email following this order makes me question product quality and security as far price goes if ingredients are as stated 90 for the price is good
very cheap for a 3 pack and the color is great but thats because of babylips
i tried several kinds all homeopathic nasal spray for sinus  this is probably second fav works good but best one is seagate olive relief for me
just what i needed for my bottles with squeez topswatch some of the videos where a lady has rearranged the slots to meet her needs way cooli got the finished box but i almost wish id hotter it unfinished i dont like the smell and im afraid that once my oils are in it that smell will mix badly maybe ill just set it out with the lid open for a week
unfortunately this mostly just pushes dust around very little clings to the brush i thought after washing it maybe it would be activated but still no i should have returned this when i had the chance now im stuck with itwould not recommend
they dont have alot of peanut butter flavor but theyre tasty considering the carb count and the amount of protein i definitely would buy them again perhaps the lemon bar flavor they have a good lemon taste
this is a good selection of balloons for a graduation party i loved the confetti filled ones the numbers are huge but one of the four numbers had a leak in it from the getgo we taped it up but it was never as full as the other ones
since a relative had a knee replacement weve tried 2 brands of ice bags and 3 brands of cold packs to keep her swelling under control she prefers this ice bag at night because it gets the coldest and conforms to her knee the best get the 11inch bag for knees youll need the extra width once the ice bag is full the 3inch wide opening on this bag enables you to include larger ice chunks instead of having to hammer ice into tiny chunks to get them to fit be sure to dry the threads of the ice cap on the bag and cap before and after use i had leaking from another brand of ice bag after shreds of ice got caught in the threads when i screwed the cap on the leaking stopped with that bag and ive never had leaking with this bag when i kept everything dry
originally purchased for travelling easy to pack and takes up little space had some left and started using on a regular basis does a great job takes up far less space in my tiny laundry room than those big tubs of detergent never makes a mess  what more can i ask for
ugly colors
i purchased wrong size but item was good
this thing actually works i was skeptical at first but i am now a believer cool to the touch and you can set how hot you want it to be on your hair works on all hair types and so much easier than a flat iron straightens the hair without taking away its volume
due to extreme lymphedema i need to almost constantly have my legs ankles and feet wrapped but the ace bandages would bother my skin especially since its dry and the warmer weather was coming and we had days that i was sweating so much it was suggested to me to purchase these and we would use them as a barrier between my skin and the ace bandages well it worked quite well i would have the nurse or the aide depending on whos day it was here to wrap as suggested and sure enough it not only stopped that feeling of sweating but also the little breaks in skin i had got a chance to heal and by using lotion first and then sealing it in with the clean wraps it helped my skin to absorb and become softer smoother and healthier i highly recommend these
i dont know why i keep selecting these weird powders when they appear on my list of items i can review  i really cant tell if they have any positive or negative effects on me after consuming  i assume they are healthy in some way so i dutifully add a spoonful or two to of them to my daily smoothies  i cant even detect that the astragalus powder is in my smoothie because it blends in smoothly with everything else and i cant taste it  i guess if you are interested in astragalus powder you already know why you want it  ill just tell you it tastes fine and mixes well
we liked it was easy to scrape the plates off
i use zip lock all the time and i like these because they had texans on them
now sure what theyre talking about warmth  i love this flosser  it has different setting i use soft which is still pretty strong  the water pulsates through and you have to be careful with how wide your mouth is open or water gets everywhere  definitely makes me want to use it  only drawback is where the buttons are placed ive accidentally turned it on a few times and water sprayed all over the place  the water tank holds enough for two uses but the charger lasts forever
i got this drpedi kinesiology tape bulk muscle tape for my wife and i  we have both been sidelined for several months she severely broke her foot back in november 2020 and i hang a torn hamstring and then last month surgery for another issue i knew wed be needing tape as we were allowed to get back into working out primarily i had wanted something for her  this foot break was so bad she was literally off it for 5 months  no weight and she loves working out so i thought having tape would help give her support  and confidence  as she returns she was finally cleared and has been very slow in building back up what shes allowed to do today she finally was able to jump rope and put enough pressure on it to require the support shes very happy with the drpedi kinesiology tape bulk muscle tape first there are three roles second it comes in precut lengths which were perfect for her today she had the whole piece  she used three full stripes at points around her foot it proved excellent support and made her feel completely safe as she jumped  this is a major step forward for her after such a major break  2 bones one almost shattered so that this drpedi kinesiology tape bulk muscle tape kept her safe and secure is a good thing admittedly she literally is only just back  and im still another week from being cleared  but i am so happy she felt safe while she was out there she did not cut it down  there are the lines so she could have  but the recommendation was keep full pieces for what she needs the corners are prerounded so we are hoping it keeps the corners from peeling too quickly again this was her first time but so far we are very happy with the outcome
good for four or five cigars or 2 with a lighter
i have long thick hair having said that these things are worthless they are hard stiff plastic have no give to them i tried using them several times and couldnt get them to work at all waste of money
i went to vegas a week ago and was told to carry an amethyst for luck  this was told to me by one of those fortune telling machines that spits out a card  the amazing thing is i am an aquarius so amethyst is my lucky stone  i ordered this stone not knowing what to expect  when it came i was stunned at the beauty of the packaging and the positive energy flowing from the productthe stone is gorgeous and has so much positive auras flowing through it as i held it  it is a big stone that fits perfectly into my palm i love how it feels and how it makes me feel  i have noticed that i am more calm and more in tuned with my intuition  whenever i am upset or feel out of balance i hold the stone and everything is fine with the world again  in addition to i feel like it is my lucky stonei am glad that i ordered two stones one for myself and one for my sister who is also an aquariuswhat sets this stone apart is the vibrational energy  i have ordered stones from ebay before and none of them gave me as much positive vibes as these stones  i am so happy to have finally found someone who is selling real stones with positive energyby the way i bought a lottery ticket and won the mega ball  although it wasnt the 207 million dollar prize its a start   i believe the stone is just warming up with with luck
my family loves this game we always can squeeze in one or two games after dinner and before bed my 8 and 5 year old boys think it is so fun a great game that is entertaining for both kids and adults
these meal are great  and filling
we regret only that it is cheaper per bottle to buy a pair than three sad marketing but it is our fault for not looking more closely at the prices otherwise the product is great we purchase it regularly
this is a good multivitamin containing known vitamins that boost your immune system  it contains vitamin c elderberry echinacea vitamin e and turmeric its not known how multivitamins like this will prevent infection from coronaviruses but taking these certainly cant hurt i generally prefer gummy vitamins but these are easy to swallow recommended
i am usually in ketosis  but when i cheat i cheat and fall out with sugars and breads  i know its the worst thing i could fall out withat night after a cheat day i will wake up and have to jump out of bed to the worst calf cramps i have ever had  this magnesium is the only thing that has taken care of this issueso now the pain of cheating is only in the regular pain like weight gain guilt the three days of fasting with gross glycogen hunger pangs
dont waste you time or money on other products very effective and pet friendly i did the carpets under 2 king size beds and still have plenty left  ill be buying a second to keep 34on hand34
seriously a shoe horn  whats so special about this  first not only can you not find these in any brick and mortar store when i asked the sales people if they had a shoe horn they looked at me like i had 3 heads  thankfully i found this on amazon and i must say the is the most amazing shoe horn ever  i have used shoe horns for years and my roommate said she wanted to get one so i bought her this one  but now im buying more for friends and family members because this is such a useful and wellmade product  the handle extends to the point where i dont even have to bend over at all im 54 and the part you put your heel on is very comfortable and helps your feet slip into your shoes like butta butterlol  seriously this is an amazing product  buy it
not really sure it this item really does anything might be more of a placebo thing its not quite either you can hear it within 10 feet
great for toenails
i do have 3 sets of these a black a pink  a silver set 2 sets i have had for years decided i wanted to pick up a third set they are great for travel i have tubes of different colors for different color pallets one color tube maybe the pink set for browns for a natural look a different color tube maybe the black set for graysblack for a dramatic look i use the third tube example the gray tube for a small blush brush and maybe a smaller brow brush  eyelash comb they they perform pretty darn well for travel brushes i have been very happy with them the brushes are protected by the tubes so no bend bristles upon arrival at my destination have not had any issues with shedding either even from the 2 sets i have had for several years highly recommend
i cant believe the difference between this product and other vitamin c supplements ive been taking i had issues with my gums and an infection nothing was working to help heal after taking this liposomal vitamin c for over a week now the infection is gone i am so thankful
just what i expected
listen lets be frank it tastes yucky yes but appears to work i am very bad at being consistent in taking something that i dont really like but maca powder seems to balance the system boost energy and certainly keeps you regular as to the claims of heightened sexual appetite not so sure perhaps one has to take it a while first hint the easiest way for me to take something that reminds me of dirty chalk in my mouth is to mix it with a very hot sweetened vanilla based tea like pumpkin spice vanilla bean or even almond even a regular basic tea sweetened with a tiny splash of vanilla extract is better
i have been taking magnesium capsules for a long time and i wanted to try topical form magnesium you can feel the relaxing effect just few minutes after it is apply
this is kind of a kit   though it has an odd number of items included12  3d face bracket50  extenders2  lanyards3d face bracket  really small  might work best for kids  depends upon the size of your face  they are made in china and i can only assume they are made for smaller faces  but it can also depends upon the type of mask youre wearing if youll be able to use them  they measure 4 across by 325 tallextenders  55 long x 75 wide  these are made of hard plastic  youll find some of soft silicone   but these are hard plasticlanyards  again   odd that there are only two  they measure 135 long  for kids and smaller necks  the latches on the end are plastic and quite challenging to openwhen you add 50122  64   and at the current price of sixteen bucks   that comes out to 25 cents perpiece which is really not bad at all  one of the more affordable such items ive seenmade in china
at the current price of 3324 3499 minus 5 this is super expensive for something that can only be used as a nightlight i was unable to pair this to any bluetooth device and i tried a couple also the touch controls are quirky the timer goes off by itself with any button change the light comes on automatically sometimes and the pausemove ahead button is for show only as it does nothing there are buttons on the front of the unit and on the bottom it is impossible to read the bottom buttons this is nice as a nightlight only and is barely functional as a sound machine with only 5 sounds this is definitely not worth the current price for such a quirky and partially working sound machine
these bags are so extremely thin theyare a complete waste five bags completely shredded as i was trying to open one
this kt tape is great stays on pretty well even after a couple showers i would definitely recommend great value for the price
works like a charm  has the bottom of my feet feeling baby soft  i have  the funkiest sweatiest feet ever seen in a woman  i have tried the as seen on tv products and  slathering my feet in coconut oil and wearing socks etc to no avail  but when i found this all the other went in the trash  i have been using this product on my feet for a few weeks   after use  i apply some foot cream to smoothen my feet foot cream and this scrapper are a  good combination to have healthier looking feet soon
these nail clippers work as expected and are strong they come in a tin case with a protective foam
i have long been curious about wen but am always leery of getting locked into automatic shipments which is what happens often when ordering from tv or a website i found out that sephora now sells it so off i went to buy some i was convinced that it was the answer for my sunandcurlingirondamaged hair i bought the almond mint one there and tried it a few times quite frankly at the time i was disappointed and returned to my regular shampoo  conditioner admittedly my hair was in pretty bad shape well a few weeks ago i went to the salon and had about 8 inches cut off and i tried wen on it again and had several good hair days i became curious about this orange blossom scent which is not available at sephora so i ordered iti actually buckled down and followed directions this time it has taken some patience but i finally got the knack of how best to use it on my hair my hair is now short in back longer in front with bangs the texture is mediumfine and i have a good bit of hair so it often looks thicker than it really is humid climate plays a part in that first off 1016 pumps of this is far too much and takes forever to rinse out the magic number for me is 57 pumps secondly i use lukewarm not cold water to wash and cooler water to rinse and i do rinse well after leaving it on for the duration of my shower  this is very important as it will leave a film on my hair if i dont thirdly i massage it very well into my scalp adding a bit more water and then comb through to the endsboth the almond mint and the orange blossom work equally well so i know this orange blossom wen is the real thing my hair looks and feels better than it has in a long time it has bounce shine and holds a style beautifully i now only use a tiny bit of mousse on my bangs and spray lightly with hairspray and do not need to comb or brush for the rest of the day even in high humidity i do work outside and so the style does fall some by the end of the day but that is to be expected with an active job like mine but the damage and dryness that had been plaguing me have all but disappeared since i have been using wen when i feel it creeping back i just use the remoist mask by wen and that fixes it straight awaya note on the scent it really does not smell like orange blossoms to me but it is pleasant with a fresh floral aroma and maybe just a hint of spice i can still smell it faintly in my hair after blow drying whereas with the almond mint i cannoti am really happy with this product and do not intend to ever use anything else on my hair again
really makes a difference with how my joints feel and helps me to maintain a positive moodquality is great
just as described
always helpful
i got two packages of these for travel i was not real fond of the strong watermelon flavor  it was way too sweet for me so i ended up sending back one of the packages they do work well for sleep but if you dont like watermelon or sweet i dont recommend
so glad i found this and the price was great very happy
taking it for cancer
works perfectlywe cant sleep without it
the lid is cracked and leaked all of the liquid out poor packing and broken lid had to throw away not happy i wouldnt recommend this product
love this makes it so easy to carry my oils with me now
good for pain
it takes a few weeks to receive this product but they are great glasses
i purchased this through a health food store  i do have a coupe of sensitive spots on my scalp and it has managed to calms those spots of my scalp  it does not take days to calm everything down it only takes seconds  i will buy this product soon  it also eases the itching of my scalp and as far as i am considered this is a miraclei did not know this product existed  i found this while searching the supplement aisles at the grocery store
the bristles are a little soft but these are awesome and work well
if you wear jewelry beware because your jewelry will get caught on this and could be damaged if you try to pull it off
these dont work at all in fact they seemed to amplify some of the sound by reverberating basslow frequency in my ears they were comfortable and soft silicone but that means nothing if they dont work for their intended purpose
pleasant peppermint scent that really works seems like a great company to work with for natural products
cant get over the taste tried mixing it in smoothies but nothing can mask the flavor tastes like grass
the product themselves seemed fine but the gift box packaging was all scratched up had to send back and order a different one its a good gift at an affordable price but my rating is cause i received a faulty one might reorder and update my review
i wish it was faster but i think i can live with this
the oviduct is very easy to use non greasy and covers the area very well plus the insects do not land on the skin that is covered with the product
best invention no more dryer sheets and paper towel rolls ever again no smoke is blown out as well which is a plus
id much prefer a smaller tablet  or even two for the same dose they are hard and large making them difficult to swallow
i ended up not not being able to take this  myoinositol is great for hashimotos  i have elevated tpo antibodies and elevated tsh  but i missed the addition of dchiro which is great for pcos  but the dchiro portion lowers cortisol and my cortisol is actually already on the low side  one needs well functioning adrenals to help with the hashimotos so it is a catch 22as a side note  cordyceps is supposed to lower tpo antibodies by 45 if that is something you needso while these capsules are easy to take and did not upset my gut i could not continue taking them
this powder is a natural herb that touts benefits to your liver including detoxification in addition its supposed to contain lots of antioxidants and antiinflamatort agents its a fine brown powder with a very slight earthy taste i tried mixing it with some iced tea and ended up with lots of clumps i think a better way to use this might be to sprinkle it on a salad or if you were actually blending a drink like a smoothie
fantastic idea but tips over very easily
i dont have this so i guess i sent it back without ever trying it sorry no review then dont even remember why
a good product with proven calming ingredients these ingredients overlap with some sleeping pills and this product can make you feel tired for many people these pills are best for after the work day is over and closer to bed timeif you are hoping for a flow state at work or an alternative to adhd drugs this product is not intended for that if that is your goal start with 200400mg of ltheanine by itself to see how far that gets you ltheanine is an inexpensive pleasant tasting powder and it will be calming without making you tiredthe price as i write this is 1serving that price is reasonable if you consider the premium ingredients like ksm66 ashwagandha you are paying for convenience by having a company blend powders and put them in a capsule people in the target market can afford 1servingthe product is made in the usa at a gmp facility
i have been buying these little guys for quite some time i love them because they are unscented and they are not huge this time when i bought them the packages are different they do not have the same plastic lid and the biggest difference is the wipes are not layered within one another so that when you pull one out the next when its ready there is no way little hands or fingers of little children are going to be able to figure out how to get the wipes out i end up pulling out wads of them i am not sure why this changed and i do not like it and i will not buy these again until i can be assured that they are layered so they come out of the container easy
i have a lot of pain in my feet and after wearing these i have a lot less pain these are very comfortable to wear and stay in place its like walking on a cloud
i really like the taste of the nectar brand this particular flavor was very tasty i mix mine with fat free milk
this facial skin scrubber is not a bad little gadget it has an easy to clean stainless steel spatula the unit has 3 different settings cleaning and moisturizing which are similar to each other and uplifting that is definitely different on how it vibrates on your skinwhen you use it it definitely feels interesting on your skin when you use the cleaning and moisturizing settings you should use a cleaning solution or moisturizing solution of sortthe facial scrubber is a nice lightweight little unit that sits comfortably in your hand it is very easy to operate and easy to use you just have to figure out which setting you want to use i really like using this it is much gentler in cleaning blackheads and such then squeezing them with your fingers or using those blackhead tools that often damage your skin and also hurt this is nice and gentle and actually feels good it is not very expensive either so a nice little investment for your skin that should be worth it
doesnt work at all save your money
i bought this shoehorn to keep in my car i have rods implanted in my spine and parkinsons with neuropathy in both feet so i cant feel my feet nor can i touch them as such i need help putting my shoes on and its surprising how many times you need to remove your shoes when you are out and about at home i use a solid one piece shoe horn 32 long which has obvious benefits but you cant exactly carry it around in your pocketthis shoehorn folds down to a reasonable 14 inches and easily fits in a jacket pocket or the back of your pants it only takes a twist of the wrist to lock or unlock the length and it is sturdy and affordable this shoehorn works well and i would definitely recommend this to others
wow i am super impressed with this shaver it works effectively to shave off my quarantine fur it was easy to use  was fully charged upon receipt i would definitely recommend this shaver to all
i love baths so i was excited to try this  its so cool to see it dissolve and make a bunch of bubbles  i really like the scent  it smells so fresh and clean because of the essential oils
good purchase
works great exactly what i was looking for easy to put together too
unlike other filters this one actually helps to reduce the amount of fog on my glasses it is hard to wear a mask if you cant see through your glasses this makes seeing easier
firm in both support and the cotton
i got these for my wife  she tells me they are easy to take but she really cant tell if they make any difference  sorry
been using for homemade ejuice for years  no issues
i dont know why i never thought about getting a pill box in the past especially since i usually grab an empty medicine bottle to carry benadryl aspirin etc when i go out of town and i always say to myself i dont want to mix my pills but i also dont want to carry multiple prescription bottles so when i was offered these for an honest review i said to myself this really makes so much sense and guess what it does lizimandu has created some beautiful pill boxes inspired by van gogh these are perfect for people who travel or who have to take medicine on a regular basis each pill box is divided into 3 compartments they are small enough to fit inside your purse travelmakeup bag or bookbag they arent that expensive and would be perfect to give as gifts the only reason i am deducting a half of star is because i believe having a removable option for the compartment would allow people to put larger pills inside perhaps having the ability to twist the compartment and remove it would have made this 5 stars
soylent meal replacement ive tried the original im not a fan of it of the flavor its kind of blah but when you add in some fruits like pineapple or blueberries are bananas it really becomes pretty good but over time you get tired of it this flavor though is really good the chocolate you dont really need any added ingredients to drink it i do a dice kind of make it a smoothie in a sense one thing i do got to say it goes by and i go through quite fast doing the measuring properly portable generator last about a week if you use it on a regular basis i really love the product i think buying the bottles is a waste of money especially if youre drinking you on a regular basis
cleans out what you dont even know is there love it
excellent for viewing photographic contact prints
this basket fit right on my dads walker he has one that has curved supports in the fromt this hit right on  i dont think it would fit walkers with straight supports
what a waste of money
i love this stuff  i have a low thyroid and use this all the time to stay 34regular34  it does taste a bit chalky if you dont mix with something  i put in my morning smoothie and blend it in and it works great
i purchased this product to use under leukotape at the recommendation of my physical therapist ive used it on my knees feet and back and found it to be tremendously helpful in supporting my joints and relieving pain
personally  i hate seeing a review for a supplement from someone who has only used it a couple of times  its not long enough to determine if it really works or if there are significant side effects  i actually took these for a full month before recording my experience  overall  it was a positive onei  have a spinal cord injury and like many wheelchair users i have a problem with muscle spasms  using a magnesium supplement has worked better than muscle relaxers and without all of the nasty side effects  this is a lower dosage than i usually use  but the absorption is better apparently because it works just as well  its also a good choice if you are starting out  its not a high enough dose to cause digestive problems
love the selection of colors and that these are all hypoallergenic perfect
hardly use it  not that great of a product
good material
because everyone is hoarding everything and apparently decided vicks will cure covid19 it wont my poor little immunocompromised kiddo was suffering with a chest coldi searched amazon and got the idea to type in chest rub and this little gem came up and while it doesnt smell like traditional vicks it smells amazing actually she loves itit leaves her skin soft i rubbit on her heart surgery scar and it is softer now we also put it on her back and feet ive barely made a dent in the jar when it wears off she brings it to me knowing it will make her feel betterwe will 100 be buying again
for me this works great and i love that its 24hr so i can get through the entire day without having to stop and remember to take another in mid day or so
brush too soft should be for children only brush head must be replaced every month not good not stated on description instructions had to be enlarged in order to read them merchandise returned
great for whites keep them really bright with a combo oxy and bleach oxy and  bleach throw them together at once the chemicals dont agree with each other just throw oxy  the same time you use the detergent then bleach has his own separate dispenser
i use these bags all the time however after 1 or 2 uses they dont work anymore  they are especially good for strawberries
excellent product  helps reduce coughing
wonderful set sturdy and well made
this is my go to i feel like i got hit by a bus medicine i like that its a hot liquid and not a syrup that burns going down it helps me feel better and to get comfortable enough to get some sleep the taste is pleasant you cant go wrong with honey and lemon with a sore throat and congestion if they ever stop making this im gonna be in troublei love you theraflu
i use this everyday so good
seems to do a good job stopping the itch without a horrid smell
my son love it i would be again its fun excited and leaves no mess
these lip balms contain essential oils this is not disclosed in the ingredient list in the product description or in the sellers response to a question about ingredients those of us with allergies rely on this information being accurate especially when a product claims to be fragrancefree now i have to go through the hassle of returning this product when it was misrepresented on amazon
this stuff does exactly what it says it will do relieve pain and make you feel better  happy
love these they work very well to keep baby happy and regular especially as we are starting to feed baby solids
with covid eyeglasses all fogged up we purchased this  it kind of works  the process to cleanapply is much different than regular eyeglass cleaner and you spray smear it around until dry and then wipe any streaks off  the glass still fogged up from breathing but much less than untreated lenses  will keep and try again until i can figure this stuff out
first the good this product comes in a package with a roller ball in it so it is easy to apply topically the bottle is dark so it protects the oils insidenow the middling the scent is tolerable but not particularly mind blowing it doesnt last longfinally the bad i didnt notice that this blend of essential oils really did much for me it certainly didnt offer me any relief mostly because it wasnt strong enough to last for any length of time i wont be buying this product again
how did people clean walls before these the magic part of the name is more accurate than anything i can think of
these are really nice gift boxes  very fancy and can be used for any occasion  super easy to set up and the kids gold down nice  add a little tissue paper and your really ready for any small gift giving need  love the shiny color that is really suitable for any occasion
ive been using turkey tail mushroom since 2014 ever since i was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis this brand is really good just one a day for the past couple weeks has been great i dont feel as sluggish and i feel it does a great job protecting my liver
cut great so far time will tell how they last
the innate vitality krill oil looks like a good replacement for another companys krill oil that was costing me almost double i have been taking the product for almost 3 weeks now 2 capsules daily one in the morning and the other after dinner which is late usually about 8 or 830 in that time i have not experienced any aftertaste nor have i detected any scent except for a very slight one which is too be expected as all health supplements have their own unique fragrancethe jury is still out if this will help my irregular high blood pressure but i know it will take some time for my body to see the overall benefits but it seems from the research i have done that krill oil has been proven scientifically to benefit your cardiovascular system i will be ordering my next bottle shortly as they are out of stock right now and possibly go on a subscription basis if one is offered
simple but attractive  tissue paper adds a nice pop of color
i like these reading glasses a great deal for reading in reasonably good light  in dim light i need stronger magnification but for most uses these are fine  they are attractive and each pair has a carrying case but the cases are a little tight  i like this product because i like to stash reading glasses around the house and these are reasonably enough priced that i can afford several pair  all in all highly recommended
these are certainly small and lightweight but if you are traveling to a location with complimentary shampoo i recommend just using the shampoo to wash your clothes most plain shampoos work very well as a laundry soap but im not sure about the type with conditioner  i had some pretty dirty hiking clothes and the shampoo seemed to get them cleaner than this soap
i have on used two out of the box they left me very tired the next day
too grainy i had to keep stirring it to keep it from settling so i could drink it
exactly as expected i just throw it in the washer when done works well on my floors i recommend these
perfect portions for brushing teeth rinsing with mouth wash and a handy spray container for freshening up your breath as needed
works as expected no problems
smells like a new unit was installed
great product a bit expensive but works well
these make great gifts love the lavender scent and the bombs are a nice size too they last a bit and make your bath a relaxing spa the tops have little lavender buds which is a nice touch
i got this to help support my weak knee and get the benefits of the compression sleeve i didnt want to wear two separate items when everything can be had it this one item the sleeve is tight but i know thats the compression working once on its comfortable and i dont feel any discomfort wished it came in a 2pack so my legs feel balanced but happy with it giving my one weaker knee support
very easy to mix into a shake or just water  i usually mix mine into my morning glass of water  definitely noticed increased hydration
this is amazing i am a light sleeper and need white noise in order to fall asleep it is loud enough for me was a little expensive for a white noise machine but i am very glad i bought it have been using it for 6 months and is working perfectly
i cleaned all the markers that my little people did and it take a little elbow work but it works your walls and my side table in the kitchen is back to normal smells great it dont agitates my sinuses i need to get a huge tub of this stuff shines stainless steel to a sparkle on my sink just goobles up the water mineral buildup never using other stuff after this now i dont have to sand down my walls because of marker marks hope this helps someone out get this box first comes with a two different scrubbier and start getting the same stuff after that no disappointment
i used this after the cake foaming cleanser the powder doesnt come out as easily as i would like i had to rub the blobs into my toy i feel my toy is left clean and soft the ingredients are nothing more than cornstarch so its pretty overpriced but it works
either this is a bit awkward to use or im just not used to it yet since i use a shower bench its helpful to have a lower location for a shower head holder the suction cup grips the tile really well but its a bit hard to position the shower head in the holder probably because i have a fairly large shower head this product would be better suited to a small or mediumsized shower head
every thing i needed
as described  recommended seller
adorable little bundles  smelled wonderful too
love and will buy again
these smell a little fishy but other than that i am happy with these they are vegetarian friendly organic and nongmo i take spirulina for overall health they are a superfood and very nutrient dense so i take them every day the recommended dose is 6 so i split them up and take 3 in the morning and 3 at night they are easy to take and easy on the stomach and i could even take them on an empty stomach without nausea or after tasteburps
so glad i bought this  we make our own bubble solution and it is so much cheaper than even the dollar store version  the homemade stuff even works a lot better  this stuff is great for bubbles  i also found a recipe for bubble bath that i am going to try  i would recommend this because it was a great price and it works well
listen people  call your vet and ask how to use this product  i have this and our vet said use it after the special shampoo after she dries  use a little anytime you see itching massage into skin but dont use much  its not a rinse just after shampoo when wet  dont complain something doesnt work when you dont know how to use it  my dogs dermatologist  recommends this product  some people kill me because they dont think
great for little ones the color holds well and the design is cute
these are so pretty and wash up great  hand wash would surely recommend
i liked the effect from these corneacare rescue self cooling hydrogel cold compress eye cooling pads personally i preferred the cooling effect after putting them eye cooling pads in the fridge before using but i found them to be very helpful with my dry eyes and puffy eyes from allergies
i chose these cases because of the way they look and having the tools with them in the case therefore i could see my contacts through the top to my surprise the cases are not leak proof
it may be a particular brand of tennis shoe but when i walk for long periods of time in them my toes start to hurt usually it is my second toe and it hurt like it was sprained  anyway i am overweight and attributed a lot of the problem to my weight but noticed with other sneakersflip flops etc with the same distance when walking the pain didnt happen  the tennis shoes were expensive and it was too late to return them so instead of losing out on being able to wear them entirely i thought to try these  they worked and they worked well  i dont experience that same pain in my toes or when it does it is after walking over two miles and not on the first mile  a fairly inexpensive fix to the problem but next time i go to purchase new walking shoes i will try a different brand
i have these in each room because i usually have my hands full when entering a room  i dont have to get out of  to turn off the lights to go to sleep
just what i needed to balance my walking step due to one leg being slightly shorter than the other which my doctor prescribed for me perfect plus very fast shipper i am highly satisfied
i love these gel inserts as i have the double wammy of foot issues  i have heel spurs and planters fasiicitis  because of back issues i dont wear heels flats are the only way for me to roll i switch them around to different shoes  so inserts are my best friend you laugh as i make such a big deal outta inserts but there are those out there in amazon land that know what i am saying  you get 2 pairs for 599 thats a good deal
i thought it was like i had years ago but things change  i returned it not a sticky and although it worked somewhat not what i had expected
used to clean outdoor furniture cushions and it did a great job  plan to purchase again
chocolatey but not chocolate milk i despise chocolate milk flavor reminds me of the inside of a 3musketeers candy bar liquify that keep it thick and that is what it makes me think of it is really thick could easily water it down or use milk of choice or add to blender with some ice and get something that tastes much like a milk shake or frosty reminds me of a frosty when i do thatnot a low calorie food but is within the norm for drinks and powders of this ilk i love meal replacement drinks over plain protein as the added vitamins minerals and fiber make me feel better than protein alone  i make smoothies and use prefab nutrition drinks like this as a means to get something in my body when i dont feel like eating i often dont have an appetite until half way through my day but i will feel some low level hunger and i know i need something to power me through my physical work day so a simple smoothie usually works and allows me to add in other supplements such as collagen mushroom powder that being said at some point i am never quite satisfied with a liquid meal but still dont want a meal so i usually add in a few nibbles of something whether it be fruit veg cheese stick snack bar etcworks great as a snack or even as a dessertsweetened primarily with allulose and finishes with some sucralose splenda i dont really have an opinion on either sweetener i find both are very sweet without an aftertaste and i dont have digestive issues from itpack of six 32 ounce bottles which contain 4 8 ounce servings all told same as a pack of 24 bottles at 8 ounces each i like the option of it having a few servings worth in one big bottle as it cuts down on packaging but it also reduces my ability to just grab and go however they do carry these in other sizesprice per ounce is very similar to others with blood glucose support in mindi have to say i didnt know what to expect with my first sip i was impressed with taste texture and how there was no odd taste or funny after taste really quite pleasing flavor the extra thick texture makes it versatile thick makes it feel like a shake and triggers belly into thinking there is something in there but it also allows for it to be watered down some if you want something to sipim impressed and would recommend this of course take a look at ingredients and decide if it is good for your needs
my kids are super picky its like they know they are eating something for their health and immediately is bad but these are great they love eating them the flavor is not strong but enough to be tasteful for them they have a great consistency and are chewablesthey are sugar free and thats really a plusin times when health is so important this probiotics are the bestlike them
good product but wrong priceone of these at walmart is 95 cents
yosemite are high quality and have reinforcement rings for holding them against the brick pillars on our four porch
i love healthy delights chews i think they are a healthy alternative to swallowing a pill and they taste good too almost as an appetite suppresant i will always  purchase these chews when i can
my 7 year old loves this it had multiple settings and it helps him brush for a full 2 minutes
i believe this product does help the pressure in my eyes  i will continue using the product
very good quality urn easy to remove lid and it stays on tightthe map is beautiful although the reason it only has 4 stars is because across the top of my lid there is the alphabet  i dont understand it  its called a world traveler urnmy brother was a world traveler so i thought it would be great for himeverybody that sees it says why is the alphabet on the top and i really have no answerbesides that everything is as describedthx
excellent product for the price  even gave some away to fellow traveler during recent cruise
not 250 power reading glasses dont know what they are because someone has taken the size off the arm should be printed like the first pair i bought but isnt no wonder the shipment was late  i purchased these before and love them but this time they are defective scratched late and wrong power sellers quality control is very very bad
i didnt realize its going to change structure of my soup like jello and i dont like it now thinking how can i use it good things is it doesnt change a taste
i love this loofah  it is especially helpful for getting rid of dry skin in winter when im cooped up in the house with the drying furnace turned on  the length is fine for me58 and it would fit a shorter person as well
dont know how clean it makes my teeth but i love the taste of the splashin citrus i could eat it actually why not bentonite is edible and so is citrus i have tried various forms of the redmond toothpastes but i hate trying to get the last of the paste out of the plastic tube it makes me nostalgic for the good old days of the metal tubes that stay rolled when you roll them with the new plastic tubes you probably lose about 14 of the toothpaste in the tube
a lot of ribbon
very cooling and soothing but almost to the point of being too strong provides relief almost immediately
does the job
easy to take great energy without tingles jitters you easily pump for 90 mins and not know it
i love them so muchi have given some away and ordered moreboth orders came exactly the way i ordered them saturday my second orderi ordered them alone were packed 2 pks in a plastic bag with a tie and then in a strong amazon shipping bag perfect thanks for the best product everi am struggling with this diabetes and i am having gastric bypass surgery and how i eat is very important to me those bags have become a part of my daily eating regime thanks for making my life better
i really wanted to like this but i just cant it has several features that just dont work for me although it fits ok the elastic is heavy and the velcro closure is very stiff overall it is quite uncomfortable to wear the velcro if not closed very carefully catches on the wrap and already there are fabric pulls where it has snagged the wrap it is also a very thin fabric and affords no warmth when you get out of the shower also i dont find it particularly absorbent it would work i guess as a 34modesty34 coverup if you were in a public place  like the gym showers but other than that i cant say much about it thats positive sorry but this is a 2 star product for me at best
keep these in my tool box around the shop  even in my truck  handy for an assortment of uses  hold a good edge  can cut through webbing fabrics jeans thin metals and even wire in a pinch
i am thrilled with the results i have had with the jigsaw healthmagnesium wsrt not only has it lowered my bp by 40 points it has brought my sugar level down to normal levels my doctor said that if the reading continue like this she is taking me off my rxx
just what i was looking for  extras are nice too  box seems to be made well
product was not what was expected
these are great they keep pairs of socks together and reduce sorting time so far about 6 months they have been pretty durable ive purchased more to add to the household so id say they are good at least at our house
creates a good foamy lather in under a minute bristles have not fallen out and the knot is tight  initially has a musky odor and only issue would be that the handle is pretty wide i have big hands and it is a difficult to get a comfortable grip  but overall i am satisfied with the product
the smell is perfect love it i read reviews before the purchase and they were right better than ax cannot go wrong with a brand that has been around forever
i very rarely wore sneakers or athletic shoes prior to the pandemic as no matter what brand i bought dr scholls etnies reebok skechers they hurt my feet i even tried gel inserts  nothing would helpi often and with great success wore flip flops i wore them at theme parks at a racetrack running errandsbut i still craved the security of a sneakeri decided to get these and thought theyd workthe biggest issue  no guidelines to cut the insert and for what theyre charging paying customers i got a complimentary review product  that is really unacceptable even the cheap dr scholls have guidelinesas far as comfort these inserts were a tad too stiff and rough with my feet already having issues  i didnt want to wait a good two weeks to see how well they worked then again due to the pandemic  that two weeks might be months as i dont go out i mostly due curbside drivethru or delivery for what i needgiven the mixed reviews  i dont think id get these again and i would caution against anyone i personally know purchasing them
got this for my 13yr old grandsonhe carries it with him always
delicious and nutritious these help me feel better and taste fantastic pineapple flavor but not overpowering
this is my 4th or 5th pair of sleep headphones each set has been slightly different  these are the most comfortable by far  the padding around the eyes is a perfect addition  also the adjustability via the velcro type band is very helpful  my ears are low set and i have trouble getting a good fit on most headwear or glasses the system connects easily and sounds fine  i would prefer a flatter smaller speaker as these can be a little bulky feeling if you lay on them but at this price point i still love them  battery life is good too
i would love to be able to say that this helped me with stress but i cant i couldnt tell a difference i even tried some on my dog to see if it would make a difference no it did not but it didnt harm either of us maybe this isnt strong enough for me or maybe i couldnt tell a difference because of my meds
beware these came shipped fine shipping container in tacts but the  tegaderm boxes have smashed corners that look like theyve been sitting in liquid they smell like chemical i attempted to do a return and was told there are no returns on this item despite just opening the package today after receiving it 4 days agothis is a pretty expensive loss to take and if you need this for medication patches like i do its quite a bummer go somewhere else to purchase
these are great so beautiful and you can feel the quality of the grit on the files themselves ive owned quite a few brands of glass files before and im so glad i found these
doesnt stay in place and too large
this is a great way to add antioxidants to your food i prefer fresh but its not like i can find acai berries at my local grocers so this is the next best way to include them into your foods easy to use versatile  add to yogurt smoothies etc
unfortunately this flavor has milk in it disappointing but i will continue to buy the cold brew coffee flavor that tastes good  has no dairy
this is the first time that i can honestly say i couldnt wait to write a review because i am so pleased  i ordered these for my boyfriend who has an average build but is 65 and needed something to keep his medication on for psoriasis while he sleeps  the gloves at all the drug stores in our area said large but actually seemed like they were a child large  i read many reviews hoping to find something like these gloves  these gloves are awesome  they stretched perfectly and were very comfortable to wear all night although they were snug to put on the first time he said the ointment did not get wiped off of the tips of his fingers and knuckles where he needed it  i will definitely be ordering another pair  he is so happy to have a product that is actually able to give him some relief  i cant thank you enough
great for packing light
this is by far theeeeee best moisturizer i buy all that i see in the store  then i buy more my husband has severe psoriasis  this is a relief its thick but rubs in so smooth my skin is soft until the next day
too tight
best sleep aid on the market
this is initial review got this 45 days back was very easy to set up and connect with the network and the tracker however getting inconsistent results to elaborate did everything right viz place it on the hard surface keep it at the same location weighed myself keeping my feet bare and dry weighing myself  3 times at interval of one minute just to check the consistency and getting different results for weight as well as body fat  it varies by 5 to 1 pound in terms of weight and 1 in terms of body fat anyone else experiencing the same
i love trying different protein flavors to switch it up from my normal vanilla this piña colada one is definitely a new favorite the flavor is spot on and not too sweet or artificial flavored one of my favorite ways to enjoy this is mixed into some plain greek yogurt i serve myself a half cup to a full cup mix in a half to full scoop and then let it chill again a little bit before eating it completely erases any hint of whey powder and its just a nice sweet treat thats high in protein and low sugar it dissolves easily in yogurt as well as in milk when i use it for shakes i didnt experience any bloating or digestive issues highly recommend if youre looking to try new flavorhope this review is helpful
seems to be working good  helps out dry brittle hair
great product its very sturdy and the blades are sharp enough to cut without much effort a nice change from the standard cheap and flimsy little clippers
great after my foot surgery makes a difference

works great cheaper than walmart
awesome product happy customer
good product but the mattress is a bit hard for my liking so i am returning it
sticks even on greasy surface
part of the daily regimen for knee painas expected
fit perfect and you can handle hot things without a problem
this is a smart little case  it has sections and a divider to allow for separation of items which is helpful to prevent necklace chains earrings etc from getting all jumbled together  however because it does have dividers it has a bit of thickness to it  while this is a good wellmade case ill bet someone will create a jewelry organizer soon that will keep items separate without adding the extra fabric that is in this one  i also wish it came in other colors  when it comes to jewelry while traveling my preference is to have a bright color that cannot be overlooked on a dresser top or inside a hotel safe when packing to leave  how bout a bright neon greenif you find this review helpful please let me know by using the voting buttons  through the years i have relied on reviews to make smart purchases and now im trying to 34pay it forward34 by helping others with my reviews  please let me know how im doing with your vote  thanks
all the formulas are easy to use unlike other pens they arent overnight ones so you do have to time it and remember you startedresults arent mindblowing but there are results so great
very soft and holding up pretty well to washes
this thing is a godsend i was spending 100 on acupressure spa visits to lessen the pain in my neck using this the first time brought tears to me eyes because it was so damn good i was able to target the abd spot right where i needed it the most plus the heat helps wish it was more heat i also wish the handles were loops because its a tad awkward to readjust from neck to upper or lower back as you have to remove from from inside the cuffs minor thing really but being able to hang arms inside the cuffs means you get to control how mnuch pressure is applied which is the key to delviering the massage i was impressed at how well made this thing is very good stitiching and love the red glow you get from the item for the price i paid its amazing value and really does work it has helped to reduce my neck pains i use it before going to bed and wake up with much lesser pains in my neck i only wish i had bought this item sooner i wish the nodes could be spaced further apart its fixed position this thing is really meant to be used mostly on the neck but since you can move it around you can target those sore spots any where also works wonders on the lower calf not so great on lower back for me nodes too close but again simply move it around to target the spot i also wish the power cord were longer you almost need a extension cord if you want to use it where ever so keep that in mind youll need a power outlet where ever you plan to sit for the next hour
this is a rather large product but i like the shape and how it can stand up on its own on the carpet it has lights on it that fluctuate to different colors but if you are using it when you are sleeping the lights can be turned off it has several different levels of use and you can turn it on high to get the most heavy air cleaning seems to work well and its easy to remove and clean the filter
this stain remover is different than other ones ive used its like a deodorant stick style dispenser i used it on paint and fruit stains so far and it worked very well it could be used for a large variety of different stains and its easy to apply rub it on and let it sit for 15 minutes and then wash in warmhot water my kids always get all types of stains on their clothes especially white so this comes in handy a couple minutes after you apply it you could see the stain remover interact with the stain the scent is not overpowering and has a fresh smell i love that its for sensitive skin biodegradable and natural doesnt contain chemicals
i use this to wash my face with my rechargeable facial tool  after removing my makeup it is gentle smells clean doesnt strip the natural oils and has a great price point
i use this product every day
great smell and its safe for my son who had severe eczema  i get complimented all the time on how our clothes smell and its because of this and the dryer spray that method sells
this is great
good for the baby
the other brands especially the menthol ones are like hydrochloric acid up your nose with a pinch of eucalyptus they burn they dont work as well for me 4way is the best fastest acting and has the least amount of rebound superior to the oxymetazaline hcl that the more popular brand uses read your labels
theres a bunch of tiny brushes
these backnobbers were given as gifts to several family members  i have had one for years  they are amazing  i use it almost daily and i can travel with it  i highly recommend getting one so you can give yourself a back rub whenever you need or want for as long as you like instead of having to wait on someone else to do it for 30 seconds  buy one for anyone who has stress in their life
great make up remover smells nice
after many years on a duty belt my old mask and glove case gave up this replacement was reasonably priced and fit extra gloves and mask without issues
im very satisfied by this charger and i greatly appreciate the built in safeguards it deploys i was able to quickly weed out useless old nimh and nicd rechargeable batteries i have and refresh the good ones the charge discharge feature is phenomenal and has rejuvenated countless batteries i tossed in the drawer it works flawlessly i like the sleek look and i do believe i will buy another for my office at work i highly recommend this charger
be very careful with this product i read the reviews that said there was no bad side effects no jitters etc yesterday i took half of one pill before lunch to test and that was the worst day ive ever had i had to leave work early and spent all day in the bathroom with diarrhea i had pain every 1015 minutes in my stomach i was about to go to urgent care but the pain started to appear every half hour or so had to miss work the next dayplease be careful with these pills i am not sure what happened but it might be that i am that sensitive to caffeine and i drink soda a lot
the rabbit portion was too long for me and the vibration so strong itd make a jackhammer pleasurable not to mention it takes 3 hrs to charge but only lasts 1 hr
very nice scent and holds heat from microwave well love how soft it is
so far out of all the diabetic bags i have purchased i keep coming back to this case it fits my insulin pen my napkins when out to dinner and have a sanitary place to lay my stuff out my meter pouch alcohol wipes and needles and it fits in my purse i like it and there is a small pocket to put an ice pack if needed  i like it it so far i just purchased the sarah spunda by dittibags also sold on amazon bag to see how that will work for my diabetic needs suppose to arrive today i wanted something cute and feminine to carry my stuff but if the comments are accurate then i will be going back to this case
have not recieved this item yet but i love these batteries  they dont last as long as other batteries but it is worth recharging them when needed
super soft and a good price
i was so excited to try these i love coffee and tea so thats what i mixed them with as per the packet recommendations the flavors wereinteresting and different than i expected not bad but not exactly yummy either i think i would have to experiment to dial in what works best with which packet to really enjoy them and the price is too high for me to justify chugging them like a vitamin shot if you enjoy earthy tones in your coffee or teas then you will probably like them more than me i will fully admit i am picky i also didnt notice any immediate benefits after just 2 packages so i probably wont be buying them again
everyone that sees this on my dad just loves it
very comfortable and relievers pressure from hips and lower back
daily dose of probiotics that is the good bacteria that your body needs easy to swallow and has no noticeable taste  completely vegetarian and loaded with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium probiotic bacteria this digestive formula will balance intestinal flora and improve health and well being
love the product but my tin arrived in a dented box with no packaging inside lid of the tin was also dented disappointing i want to take the vitamins so i didnt want to have to send it back and wait for a replacement
finally i found a great heating pad this one has 6 heat settings and normally you would have to use the highest but not on this pad also the size is excellent i have been looking for one like this forever my neighbor is going to order one now as well thank you very much
these wipes are nice  thick they smell good also an the price is good im going to buy more because i always use wipes an these are close to cottonelle  huggies  wipes what i really like is that no white fuzz comes off the wipe buy these wipes
really nice and thick vg wexcellent taste i use this in all my diy projects
these pills have a pretty pungent odor but oddly i dont taste it or burp it up im pretty happy with the results im getting after taking them for about a week theyre definitely useful for flushing out the system and the ingredients seem to be of good quality id say theyre worth giving a try
the screw that holds the carbide tip is already rounded and difficult to unscrew
i put it under my sheets and i hadnt been sleeping well and i just told my husband i think theres a lot of energy in the air or something because i feel wired well the very first time i slept on it i felt the relief now im broke in and tell a small mount  however if i forget to plug it in i dont sleep wellvery noticeable im so glad i tried it
this really works
i have been using this for about 4 or 5 days and have not noticed anything but im going to give it more time im 52 and have bags under my eyes so am hoping this can help with themafter weeks of using daily i have not noticed anything
more energy kept me focused used this before workouts and work on computer
do not buy this came half empty this is a horrible deal for the price buy from someone else
what is better than some puff facial tissues when you have a sore runny nose nothing these are soft and even contain some lotion which means that hopefully you will be able to avoid that red irritated nose that often results from a bad cold the cube shaped box contains 52 soft tissues this 10 pack can be divided and used in multiple places i have a box on my desk at work one in my car and others strategically placed around my house
we purchased this for our babys room we already had one for our own bedroom and loved it totally drowns out the sounds of life outside the window and allows for a deeper sleepour baby now associates the noise machine with sleeping and her eyelids start drooping the moment we turn it onfour stars because it does seem that the noise gets softermuffled after a few months of use i thought maybe this was just me going deaf but i dont think so the new one we got for the baby is definitely louder than our old workhorse i also think the holes in the machine that are supposed to allow you to vary the volume of sound dont really do enough there is a noticeable difference in volume but not enough rangeupdated review february 2017 one of our machines has developed a truly irritating rattle it took a couple days of terrible sleep before i figured it out like another reviewer mentioned it seems better if the machine is on an angle but the rattle is so unpredictable im ordering a replacement and hoping this is just the result of years of nightly use and not some sort of manufacturing quality issue our device and the newer one we got for our daughter are identical and weve moved them around enough that we dont know which was the original anymore
this stuff works wonders
although i havent used coppertone for years this certainly is the smell that i remember from way back when those days before an spf was listed on the bottle the days when there were billboards with the little girl with the tan line as the dog tugged on her bathing suit bottomfor nostalgia alone i would like this product the fact that it feels much better going on than i remember the old ones to be is a big plusit has an spf of 30 and since i usually use it around a pool the fact that its water resistant is also very nicejust remember to put it on as the label suggests applying at 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying after swimming or at least every 2 hours
beware these dont just fit any eyelash curler
my wife loves these tissuesso soft
if you ever have suffered from constipation then you already know that there are a lot of products available to make your bowels work easier the next morning this is the stuff that is in many of them if you need fiber you psyllium husk if you need to ease constipation you use senna
delicious i must be the only person who likes the taste of this stuff
just as described very pleased
my boyfriend swears by tart cherries in any form  ive read a lot about them and sour cherry reduces inflammation and muscle soreness helps with insomnia and prevents gout a form of arthritis  inflammation is my middle name so i wanted to try this although i dont have gout i do have arthritis in various parts of my body i also have daily muscle aches and inflammation which was recently verified by a doctor yet after consuming these capsules for a couple of weeks they have had no effect either good or bad on me i should be finished with the bottle in another two weeks  the positive is that i did not have any side effects  ive used natures bounty red yeast rice and although that product worked for me to lower my cholesterol i had a permanent nasty side effect from it therefore i consider the absence of any bad effects with this supplement a big plus on the other hand ive had no reduction in soreness or inflammation so its like taking a placebo for me  it does appear this tart cherry concentrate works for some so i suggest anyone considering this give it a trydepending on how many pills are taken per day this bottle provides a 60 30 or 20 day supply the recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills per day with meals the max ive taken was 2 per dayi called natures bounty to understand why the bottle says 1000mg equivalent on the front yet the back says 250mg per capsule what the fellow say to me was that the powder is concentrated and the 250 is the weight if you were to empty the contents of the capsule however he said since it is an extract these compressed components are equivalent to 1000mg per capsule whether this is really true or not i have no ideaas for the ingredients besides the tart cherry prunus cerasus fruit extract each capsule also includes vegetable cellulose and less than 2 of silica and vegetable magnesium stearate this is suitable for vegetarians
did not stay secure on walker had to return
my husband is so tight in the pocket he squeaks when he walkshe washes and disinfects and stores plastic neti potsgreat but when i need one i just cannot bring myself to use someone elses snot washer i mean reallythis is a good deal nicer and its not going to break my bank if you are really strapped for cash there are videos on how to flush your sinuses without spending any money at all for my sensibilities this two pack is great
great stuff slept well did not wake up hung over use 14 bottle  the problem is  my roommate keeps taking them
awesome toilet paper i love charmin big rolls like this they last a while in the household
i thought it worked well in the beginning but later it failed to help with the leg cramps
cheap quality
this product was okayit does leave your skin feeling baby soft definitely recommend it to friends you still have to use an additional cream afterwards to prevent stubborn ingrowns
makes it so much easier to get around when using a walker
i really like this toothpaste you only need a little so it last a long time seems to be whitening my teeth i am allergic to sls and have had no reaction wish it was less expensive but other than that i love it
informative lightweight  sturdy
it is a fine product but a little shaky when i had to use itit needs a counter balanceweight
my husband made the mistake of thinking he didnt need to clean stainless steel bottles if he only drank water out of them he figured rinsing was good enough then he looked inside the bottle with a flash light this product saved his bottles i use it on my daughters hydroflask does a great job i wish the handle was a little longer and the brush part was a little bigger but it works
it took me a while to figure out how to really use these basically the idea is just to push in much like fingernails the problem is you have to push pretty hard and they can easily hurt you its not really easier than pushing your skin with your fingernails unfortunately i will keep trying to get better with them however if you have easily broken skin i would suggest being very very careful in attempting these
this seems identical to the name brand version but at a better price
great glasses nice style
perfect case for my pulse ox now i can keep up with it better
these are so cute and a great value for the money i have two daughters so the 4 pack is perfect  we can usually find 2 at bedtime theyre adorable and my girls love them
a little pricey but does what it says
excellent product i have very thin sensitive skin and using band aids usually causes more damage i was getting desperate when i saw these i had to use them this week and they are perfect for me they are truly made for sensitive skin come off easily and do no damage and they stay on until you take them off
i have been using a water machine to alkalize and purity the water for several years  my research shows that it removes many minerals along with the chlorine and fluoride which is why i purchased it  so using the purelymin is my way of replacing the minerals  i have used this brand of herbs and spices north american herb  spice co for many years and it is one of the best  nice to see that amazon is selling it

because of the way i have my desk and computer set up i lean on my left elbow while at my computer in addition my husband does most of the driving and while in the car i tend to lean my left arm on the arm rest soon i had a problem i essentially developed a 34bed sore34 on my left elbow and no matter how many creams and tender loving care i gave it i couldnt seem to get rid of it then i found and purchased this item 2 in fact  one for desk area one for car and in no time my elbow began to clear up it took off the pressure and gave the creams and ointments time to do their work i like the idea that my arm doesnt overheat because of the mesh that keeps most of the arm cool other styles didnt have that  the pad slips around a little but not badly and easily moves back into place  i keep the computer one on a small shelf that is part of my desk and the one for the car i keep in that builtin 34sidepocket34 in the door i told my dermatologist about what i was doing and he thought it was brilliant  hope it works as well for you  if you found this helpful please click where noted below and thanks
i love them cant wait to finish my doily so i can block itmuch better than using a padded towel
these were exactly as expected  they are vitamins melt fast too
very handy for soaking my night guard
it does not work at all i wasted money
unable to use until repeatedly washed had odor
i use kinesiology tape on my bad knees and i had hoped this stuff would be a support to my back while i try to reduce my belly  yeah theres one born every minute  you get one application that is not reusable  the information says that it can be used for multiple days  i dont know how to express how dumb that statement is  pregnancy doesnt last a couple of days folks  its not a sprint its a marathon  youd need to buy these every few days at best  but if you use kinesiology tape you know that its likely to peel up or loosen well before that  so youre paying for one or two days of relief which you probably wont even getjust dont okay  get one of the ones that are reusable
i honestly thought this was the worst thing i have ever tasted it did not taste like vanilla or chai it honestly tasted like dirt i have not tried the other flavors it is a bit too expensive even for a sample pack
very nice love the moist heat need to manipulate beads into parts is only negative
i searched for a good amount of time looking for vegan gummy fiber vitamins for my 3 year old  he loves them and looks forward to eating them  he thinks they are candy
read the reviews and thought id give this a try first flavor i tried pina colada  smelled great but after the first taste i had to throw it away it left a terrible after taste thankfully the variety pack had two more flavors yup they all have weird metallic after tastes terrible would not recommend
i wasnt a fan of this because it gave me the jitters
love this product very refreshing
this is perfect for college students and anyone wanting to meal prep or store left overs i love how the containers stack together easily to keep a clean cabinet comes in a set of 30 which i will actually be using at the neck family gathering to store leftovers for guests to take home instead of using zip lock bags easy to clean and store away ive been using these for a while and they were a lifesaver in college glad i can get these in bulk here highly recommended as a warning if you do microwave pasta the sauce may stain if its tomato based i usually have designated o es just for that reason other than that its perfect to freeze and reheat your meals in
i have to say i was skeptical when i ordered this product but did so because it received great reviews  and i am here to give another one  my teeth do not whiten easily due to meds taken as a toddler nothing has worked  i have been using dreow for about 5 days and my granddaughter said 34youre teeth look so much whiter34 one day when i picked her up  thanks again  i love it
these provide some support for my bad knee but ultimately they dont have any side support to stabilize my knee these are probably better for light walking and some gentle exercise though they have compression support it doesnt prevent side twisting motion which is how i can hurt my knee i dont really think there is anything special to copper infused compression sleeves it kind of reminds me of the magnetic bracelets they sell that boast claims but have no real science behind iti received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review i am under no obligation to provide a positive review and received no incentives or rewards for doing so my goal is to highlight features and drawbacks that i would want to know about as a buyer not hype the product for the manufacturer to increase sales my remarks are sincere and true i work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item my goal is ensure that these reviews are helpful to others my opinions are my own and i thoroughly believe in keeping the integrity of amazon reviews legitimate to help the community make the best choices it is just my own opinion and experience with the product your own opinion and experience may vary i received no monetary compensation and i am not required to give a good review just looking at my public profile and you will see i dont hand out many 5 star reviews they need to be earned for me to recommend a product regardless of the price i paidkindly click yes below if you found my review helpful
as soon as we opened this product we realized just how cheaply it was made we did however attempted to use it for a week at the end of that we week we through all three of the items in the trash
works out good for me not quite the one i wanted but it will doi carry a portable tank of oxygen with me and it fits down in there perty good
work very well with my machine my old ones developed a quirk where the wire plugged into the unit now it works again the item arrived quickly which was a good thing as i really needed a dependable set of wires at the time those who use a tens unit know what i am talking about the price was super reasonable for 2 sets and they shipped free with prime
it is so rough and tore off my skin and started to bleed while i was walking had to remove it midway and it was sticking to the socks bad experience and now i have to wait for healing before i put on my shoes and these happened within 2 miles walk never buy it if you have soft skin
i like all of the egg white protein bars from julians bakery  these do have a strong cinnamon flavor if you like cinnamon  my favorite are the devils food chocolate and the glazed donut  the sunbutter is an excellent choice too
nice to have to store batteries but wish it was not all these little parts  maybe combine two together
item arrived very promptly and as described by seller
my husband bought me a pair of these i had saved to our list as some other reviewers have said they fit phenomenally i have small ears and have a difficult time finding earplugs or earbuds that fit usually they will pop out or hurt my ears these for just right and i can wear them for hours without any problems i liked mine so much i ordered these for my mom she has the same issues with earplugs and earbuds but adores these thanks so much
i purchased these to replace discolored nose pads on my old glasses nose pads absorb oil from your skin and yellow with age these are great  very soft and easy to install you will need a tiny screwdriver to install them for 2 pairs of glasses it took about 10 minutes to remove the old pads and replace them with these
3 andrews  boot waxthis stuff resurrected a pair of hiking boots that i love but that definitely had seen better days the boots were scuffed and dried out looking but now look almost new i used a rag to rub a little of the leather conditioner into the boots let it sit for a few minutes then buffed with a clean cloth the boots look darker than they did before treating them but probably like they did when they were new scuffs and scratches disappeared and the boots look incredible give it a try if you have leather you think is beyond helpyoull be surprised
this review is based on my experience so ive tried several silver lozenges and i believe the manuka honey from american biotech is the best i wish they made it with agave syrup for those watching their blood sugar just buy it already lol
my purchase arrived on time and im very happy with my product
i do like kuumba but its always a hit or miss ive purchased a few different kinds and one may hold its scent and smell lovely while others have absolutely no smell whatsoever  its unfortunate
nice and small
this did clean my clothes on a recent trip to europe but then my sister used it and her hands we wet so it turned into a lump we had to just use  the direction very clearly state you must use with dry hands  so pay attention to that and you should like this product
this heated hair straightener brush is okay i didnt like the very small section that the hair should go into to straighten i have a place in the back that has a little curl but the rest of my hair is straight this straightener did not straighten that part of my hairthe box comes with a straightener brush with a power cord the handle has a power button and two buttons for raising and lowering the temperature instructions are includedi will not be recommending this heated hair straightener brush to family and friends
took for a month now still no change its kinda disappointing you spend money hoping for something but there is no drug that makes miracle happen
i bought this iron because it had great reviews and i keep seeing the thyme flat iron in my facebook feed but didnt want to spend a fortune on trying it out  it takes some getting used to you do need to twist the iron as you go but not much i did get an instant curl though you have to be careful not to flatten too much hold in place too long the iron seems like nice quality easy to turn on and change temps and i like the lights as it heats up it is pretty too and has a good weight to it i just got it so i cant speak to it lasting but for the price i am happy
i like the idea but i never figured it out three them away
for the supplement explorer the d3k2 combo has been perfect both are vital both are microvolumedose excellent designthe d3 blood test came on the scene as a routine blood panel i knew that skin produces like 100k times more d3 than science imagined that the body needed i grew up in miami enjoying more sun skin time than anyone had the right to absorb i was shocked shocked i tell you  to discover that i was short d3 how could this possibly bewhatever im happily in the normative range thanks to supplementation the implications of k2 are still a bit new but trust me  you likely need it
love the ease of these
very good product expecting the maker keeps its integrity it does help with a variety of health issues with reliability i highly recommend this product the reason for the only four stars is because the seller has increased considerably the price of it i will be searching for other options although i trust this specific brand i appreciate the sellers delivery also
this scarf is just beautiful and it is lightweight which makes it perfect for spring and summer  the quality is also very good
problem with this belt is you warm up the packet and it can get lava hot but you cannot feel it through the too thick super synthetic material of the pouch so once the super hot gel pack is inserted into the pouch you barely feel it i was looking for one with cotton pouch and clay beads but they were too  had bad ratings this would be great if the pouch was different to transfer the heat from the gel pouch plus after a few times in the microwave the gel seems to be burning through the lining of the gel pack so it might not have great longevity as well
great purchase
got the layers of grease off the cabinets from the place i rent couldnt stop touching the cabinets because they felt like new careful though on certain surfaces it can abrasive
i am buying another one because this was very needed i can actually walk around the house without my knee brace given by the hospital at home its also added support with my knee braceone huge mistake was washing it do they expect it to never be washedso ordering a new one and this time reading washing instructions or washing by hand next time
lovely scent soft silky powder terrific quality as avon products always seem to have
a positive difference noticed within the first day of use
these are excellent towels for certain cleaning tasks they are thin but absorb quickly and hold a decent amount of water they can be rinsed laid flat to dry and reused several times making them go a lot further than a roll of conventional paper towelsthey are ideal for certain cleaning tasks especially windows glass smooth tile and other types of smooth surfaces they are not however all that good for scrubbing or use over a rough surface they can be used for that but the roughness will shred the towel making it only good for one use if used on smooth surfaces they can be rinsed and reused multiple timesfor me these are ideal for washing windows i use a few sheets of these towels with cleaning liquid to get the dirt off the window then use a single microfiber cloth for a final dry and polish the used towels are rinsed and set aside to dry for the next task i can usually get 4 or 5 uses out of a single towel before it starts to shred upmy only quibble is that i dont care for the graphics printed on the towels they arent bad looking just unnecessary other than that no complaints they work well last a good amount of time eliminate the waste of using onetime use paper towels and are a good value compared to other similar towels as well compared with  conventional paper towels since one of these towels can take the place of many onetime use paper towels
barley any power didnt last long
we grilled the 12 lb burgers we got from the treasure truck and they were amazing everyone loved them we just got the hot dogs and sausages today and ive heard good things about those too cant wait
definitely can tell a difference in pump when using this product versus not some over stimulated after if you take it to late
i really like these  in just a day you notice a change in your appetite  but you dont get that caffeine high like some other products  my energy level has also pickedup  great product
we use cotton ball for different things around the house we like our crafts and beauty supplies so its good to have some on hand these are pretty much what you would expect of cotton balls only they are a bit more smaller but slightly more dense and a bit more expensive currently 499
doesnt seem to be catching enough hair or fur
this is a pretty and functional dowsing board a circle of lightweight wood it features attractive center illustrations and large readable responses the back is plain and there is no carrying case bag or box it is nice and functional  it also comes with a complimentary ankh pendant vintage style postcard and little thank you banner
little to no force required durable file on the handle is a nice touch
these dont appear to be real jade but for the price they work as i anticipated soothing and comforting moves lymph and gives a temporary plumping appearance like one would get after a facial or massage
i usually use ayer gel nadal spray when i travel on planes  its the best way to fight getting sick from traveling  keeping your nostrils moist and breathing through your nose is the key to fighting airborne germs  i used this nasal spray on my roundtrip flight to canada  this spray works well but i had to keep reapplying it  the ayer gel spray seems to coat my nostrils better but this spray works well for daily usage  i will continue using the thicker gel nadal spray on planes but i well use this at work and home because it does moisturize my nasal passages when my nose doesnt completely dry out which happens on flights
i added this to my smoothie its got a great definitely i definitely recommended this to everyone who wanted to live a healthy and happy life style plus super fast shipping great seller
i really enjoy this scale even though it does lie lol
works good not to strong but strong enough
dont know yet just got it
really great but the sand timer takes a long time to go down like 3 minutes
i had never used a pumice stone before so the fault is mine i should have ordered a finer grain stone on this one the little holes are so big they are not gentle to my feet  however the item arrived on time and as described
i love these  i worry a lot about traditional sponges and germs and saw these and thought why not try them they are amazing and so easy to disinfect my favorite feature is that one has a built in scraper which is perfect for my stoneware cookware the little hooks are a nice added touch i gave one to my mom and she is hooked
i do not recall having any nose plugs as a child but i guess they would have been made out of dinosaur parts if we did  the kids love them so thats all that counts
i am no longer working in hospital but i use in a free clinic  for humans and animals
so far they seem to do the trick my daughters gaite is offand she has flat feet non verbal autistic her doc suggested inserts and i bought these shes doing so well she even attempts to run now ill probably need to buy a few more
lovely one  convenient comfortable and easy to use love it
barley max has a pretty good taste but when they added the mint i couldnt hardly drink it  it has a sweet taste  it just doesnt work  i will continue to get barley max without the additional ingredientsi will say that this is an excellent product for adding greens to the diet
this is my fifth pair of lollop compression socks however two of the pairs are a smallmedium size and three are medium large this is a mediumlarge and runs a bit bigi take a size 9 to 95 in a womans shoe and 75 to 8 in a mans boot i ordered these in a medium  large size which is supposed to be for that size foot however they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle they do fit around the calves nicely howeveri love that they offer medium compression 1520 mmhg around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches i felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs i also like the normal sock look of these kneehighs and they wash well in the washer but i lay them flat to dry the blue hearts are very attractive even though the offwhite is a bit dingy looking i consider these socks very stylish the material is 45 cotton 40 nylon and 15 spandexif the sizing was specified correctly this would have gotten 5 stars
my daughter likes to wear stylish sneakers that dont have a lot of arch support she recently came home from college for a visit and only brought the shoes she wore with her which happened to be a pair of these shoes she was using our home elliptical machine and complained afterwards because the shoes werent very supportive i ordered these for her to see if they would help these inserts are customizable they can be trimmed for fit and then there are little pieces that you can add under the arch area in case you need to increase the arch support she says that they do improve the arch support but she would prefer one with extra cushion support in the heel and other areas too overall she does like these and is much happier with her shoes since shes added these
almost the same but perhaps not quite as thick as standard dishwashing gloves you might get from the grocery store  and maybe not quite as long in the sleeves as some others either  regardless they have plenty of great uses around house house including working on the car  anything to cut down on the cleanup time
great quality and really does the job on my car carpet bought a second one for my truck and keeps the run looking greatwho does a review on a brush but so cool i had to take a minute
i havent been using this long so far just once a day im a little confused on dosing there isnt any information regarding it on packaging other than add 1 scoop to your juice smoothy or whatever it says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract powder is that just weight or is that the actual amount because that is 3000 mg of this extract otherwise which is higher than some other similar products out there maybe the serving size just happens to be larger where as the others are smaller with expectation to use it 23 times a day this lack of clear info is frustrating hopefully other reviewers can comment on thatas for how it works well i am not exactly sure what i am looking for it to do and how to measure my experience i know it has been an ingredient used in weight loss formulations and i sure could stand to lose several pounds but im not sure about that for reviewing easily reading through some potential benefits like better digestion better concentration reduced food cravings loss of appetite reduced joint pain improved cholesterol levels  better mood etc i figure the one i can measure best is the food cravings i know what my habits are and i will know if my desire for sugary foods reduces so if i notice a reduction then i can attribute it to this so far not feeling that but it is early on and i have taken but one serving a day i will give it a little more time and report back your desires for taking this as a supplement may vary from my own there is no shortage of info on what this fruit is or its purported benefits are as well as risks such as do not take if have dementia or alzheimers  so please read up i know i am still learningactual product so i will tell you more about the product itself it is an 8 ounce bag of  garcinia cambogia extract powder it is a resealable mylar bag with a front window so you can see how much is in there it comes with a small scoop which is one serving in my pic it shows the little scoop and the amount dumped into my hand there are 76 servings in a container if you plan to use it in liquid plan to use a shaker cup or your blender just stirring it in will not work i included a pic and you can see all the powder just sitting on top strangely my spoon stayed dry so that is when i got out the shaker cup and all blended fine with thatthe taste is absent to me not sure if it supposed to have a noticeable flavor or not the fruit is tart and i hadnt noticed a tart flavor with this maybe my taste buds are off seems that it will go well with yogurt oatmeal blended into smoothies added to soups broths baked goods i have been just consuming it with plain water or some organic lemonade in a shaker cup because like i said it doesnt mix by just stirring the powder is fine and not at all gritty ill likely add it into my next smoothy i havent tried it blended in with coffee next time i will do that i imagine if you like to fill your own capsules that this powder could work for that but i dont know for sureeverything about it seems fresh and of quality i received it in 92019 and it has an expiration date of 32020 6 months from now  if i figure out anything else i will be back to update 3 stars because i need more time with product also i have no idea what the price is and lack of info is concerning
got for my dil and she loved it
i have short curly thick hair this brush works perfectly to help keep it under control love it
very easy to use and shipped really quickly  weve only had them for a few days but they work perfectly
i have not used these yet but they seem good heavy quality at a great price
how hard is it to create a scent that smells like the label and doesnt make your eyes water  nose burn and coat your throat like vapors from a tire fire  ive been very discouraged by all the glade refills ive tried harsh unpleasant and only a passing resemblance to the claims on the label
started having frequent nosebleeds and i keep one in my car in my purse by the bed hospital charged my dad 79 for one of these so this is a deal
this has really helped my success with thm so far knowing that i can make a dessert thats safe and yummy saves my sanity
this is my third main warmer i love it and its worth the money
there are four colorful compression socks in this package i wear a 910 shoe so i selected the largexlarge size a compression rating of 2030mmhg is supposed to be firm and strong however the compression is very light also the toe box feels as if it is sewn awkwardly on the sock it is not uncomfortable but has to be adjusted just so to feel besti wore these all day and they look and feel great these colors are fun and the socks feel almost like regular kneehighs  overall i do like them but i took off one star for not feeling like a compression rating of 2030mmhg and another star for the weird toe box
i bought this  20 years ago not from amazon and its still going strong  i have thin wispy hair and this keeps it all up in a bun very nicely and for hoursrecommend this
i love how great it cleans and how wonderful it smells
we used it a few times and it just stopped working
it actually works its not a quick relief but it takes the headache away it does not feel greasy or sticky
great buy perfect size for a variety of uses the included earplugs are nice too
bought this when i was a little strapped for cash and needed wick for my attys this works extremely well no wicking time very soft very workable and it is economically sound i love my cotton bacon and torii wicks but i definitely will stock up on these and keep them in my supply
love this for tender aching feet big enough not to spill over
great alternative soap
simple natural and organic ingredients the flavor is good they taste like other honey lemon lozenges ive tried before they even have silver with helps fight off infections definitely handy to have and work well for fighting off sickness
ok for a temporary fix  buy a new chair  better yet make your company buy one  osha
i love the size i love this product and i would purchase it again
i diet and walk for 30 minutes a day 5days a week its not a miracle pill but if you change your eating habits and get a little active it will work over time
have to nail on and remove old heel taps mehhhhh
i have a model 454 that must be at least 30 years old and it keeps on going  ive tried electric white noise makers over the years but they just arent the same  cant really explain why they just arent  when mine finally conks out im definitely going to get another one  i live in a noisy area a bad one too with gunshots loud cars noisy neighbors and the like and this unit does an amazing job keeping the noises downjust did a google search for the model 454 i got thisit is billed as sleepmate by marpac of wilmington nc it is model number 454this item is circa the 1960s 1960s  wow guess its lasted longer than i thought
there is hate but this is like the classic mac and cheese but i liked it more just your basic tasting noodles and fake cheese powder give it a try
i threw these away almost as soon as i opened them up  way too short  didntt fit at all
its very difficult to rate any vitamin tablet unless its toxic i have taken these for three days now and nothing has happened to me i can only assume that they are valid vitamin d3 and generally are good for aiding in the absorption of calcium and may be helpful in the prevention of osteoporosis and osteomalacia as we get older this vitamin is vital for keeping our bones strong so that if and when we fall our bones will not break or not break as badly were we not taking vitamin d3i have a history of falling and in fact have fallen many times because of a balance issue i have been taking vitamin d3 for 10 years and have yet to break any bones a bone density test revealed that i have excellent bone density for  a man of my agei find taking vitamin d3 very good for me and my pcp is adamant that i take d3 every day
felt great on scalp would definitely recommend
have you ever been in a public restroom where theyve run out of soap  for some of us this is a nightmare and this little  item is an answer to our prayers  they are very convenient to have in your purse and one sheet is all it takes to get your hands nice and clean
i ordered this for my furbaby as water through a dropper is the only way he will drink water droppers alone  are really hard to find in stores around here usually the dispenser for giving meds to kids is included in package and the price is higher than here at amazon so far it serves the purpose  for which i purchased it also i found a small brush that fits into the dropper for thorough cleaning well worth the purchase
itll take me forever to use all of these tags but they are gorgeous exactly what i was looking for
very nice dispenser and i keep it in my kitchen because it is a much more economical way to keep and use paper towels
pros1 vegan with no gelatin2 tastes good fresh and chewy3 moderate price range4 no iron5 contains iodine which is important for thyroid healthcons1 this is a basic gummy adult multivitamin you can obtain a very similar generic version through your local big box store for about onethird the price of this product
i usually check my blood pressure whenever im at a pharmacy or location with the little sit down booth i got this so i could monitor my bp at home to get an idea of my readings to keep better track it is easy to use fits my 34larger34 arm with no issues it has really great memory settings for 2 people very comfortable and my readings are very consistent
love the bottles and the color is gorgeous
nice quality and quite sturdy will see how will hold over time and under shower conditions
ssooooo uncomfortable  the thick velcro straps double back under your armpit and its like having 2 belts wrapped up under your arms miserable i couldnt wear it 10 minutes
happy with how affordable this is and that its wireless
extremely uncomfortable im a bigger woman with broad shoulders but im not that big this is ridiculously tiny it cut off circulation to my arms and it pulled the velcro loose because it ended up in the back i bought another cheaper one and it fit comfortably with the right size adjustments being available this is for very skinny or very small people
i am always looking for inserts with good arch support to help alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis usually i am disappointed in the orthotics on the market however this insert is wonderful it has the right balance of firmness and pliability which makes it feel cushiony without being overly soft or overly hard it also has a high arch that is very supportive for someone like me who has plantar fasciitisi take at 9 to 95 in shoes and sometimes a 10 depending on the cut therefore i ordered this in that womans size i use these in my bootlike slippers and i feel like i am walking on airthe current price of 1784 2099 minus 15 is competitively priced for an arch support of this quality and support they are thick comfortable and perfect for me i absolutely adore these
this will pick up a small amount of dirt from a smooth surface compared to a regular vac this is not even in the same game and fails miserably in comparison it is helpful in certain occasions such as when petting your pet and some hair get dropped on the rug and you dont feel like getting out your regular vac
great bib for a messy eater
i was told that by adding this supplement to my regular regime it would help me with a better absorption of vitamins not sure if thats true or not as i didnt notice a difference at all
just what i was looking for to take grout haze off of stone tiles  would have taken me days to do it by hand instead of hours with these
no more baggy in your pocket love that they stack easily for space saving open easy and nice pictures on them
i purchased these to clean black marks off a brand new kitchen counter at my office the counter became scratched up from tin foil catering trays and general use and regular soap wasnt doing the job with a little arm power i was able to get off most of the black marks using the magic eraser
this thing saves a bunch of time and mess and they know it cause they charge a premium  its probably 30cents of plastic you could easily make at home if you had the right toolsskills also had to drill the hole out cause its extremely difficult to push caulking out as is but it did make the job way easier just wish i didnt have to send them an arm and a leg for their price gouging
not good at all
i bought these for my sister who is a practicing wiccan  she likes to use crystals in her craft but i thought these would be good for spell jars  they are presorted into little glass bottles so you dont have to pick through the lot to get to what you need  the jars are labeled and have a cute little cork as a stopper  the gems themselves are small enough chips for even tiny spell jars  they are polished so you dont have to worry about  sharp edges
i like this using this organic peppermint and camphor lotion to massage my shoulders and back this is my first time trying this product and im surprised and satisfied
this has a 5 concentration of potassium nitrate which is the ingredient used in all sensitive toothpastes to cut down or in my case eliminate sensitive teeth issues as such it works the same as other sensitive toothpastesit does differ from others with regard to taste and consistency it has a mild minty taste that while acceptable is not all that fresh tasting the consistency is a bit softer than other toothpastes and it doesnt foam up as much while thats usually a plus good foaming action is a benefit when it comes to sensitive toothpastes since it helps the potassium nitrate get into all the nooks and crannies my favorite sensitive toothpaste is the colgate foaming action one it has the same 5 potassium nitrate as this but the foaming action does make a differencewhile the tube looks big theres not a lot of product its only filled about 12 of the way and while it looks like a standard size tube it only provides 35 oz of toothpaste its also hard to get all of it out of the tube since the tube is plastic and does not roll up it dispenses fine when mostly full but is not great at dispensing when the level gets lowwhile this does work the negatives put my score at 3 stars average not a compelling purchase compared with other options
havent really noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth i have been using it once a day it is a very fine powder
vitamin d3 is one of several supplements which if i take in pill or table form upsets my stomach so as with those other supplements am happy to try this d3 in gummy form  these gummies are really good  their fruity flavor tastes great they dissolve easily do not upset my stomach and are a good dosage  2 gummies  2000 iu  priced reasonably and made with citrus fruit pectin this one is worth adding to my daily health regime
this is great maca  super digestion as it is gelatinized and i noticed significant improvements in hormonal values and energy within a couple of days  ive also added this to my wifes smoothie protocol as well and her fibromyalgia has significantly reduced  quite accidentally i ended up leaving the stuff behind when taking a trip and within a couple of days all of the effects started to disappear  got right back on it when i got homeon the flip side i purchased this stuff at 21  just 3 months ago and now its over 31  not happy about that  however i do note that they give you discounts on shipping if you order more than one so theres that
we do a lot of day trips with a little one that spits up quite a bit its great to have a small portable stain fighting spray for those not so small stains you dont want to set in no more worry about stained clothes because you couldnt wash it right away travel stain fighter ftw
great price taste good and good packaging can not speak on benefits just received but i have been talking pollen for a while and its good stuff
these kairne reusable cotton rounds are great for removing makeup i have used them twice and they are easy to use i have not used the enclosed bag to wash them yetthe rounds come in an adorable container for storing your pads the container comes with two tops one is sort of like a stopper and the other covers it the pads could be used with a cleanser to wash your face also i just toss the used pads in the enclosed laundry bag for washing lateri will be recommending these kairne reusable cotton rounds to family and friends
i gave this nac 5 stars because its easy to swallow it doesnt upset my stomach and its the 1st nac ive taken that doesnt smell like stinky rotten eggs upon opening the bottle every day there still is a subtle smell but totally bearable
i was informed that dgl licorice would be helpful for acid reflux  it did not work for me
good product
at some points i enjoyed this but using it as hoped to sit behind my head while im driving or safely parked during lunch the strap didnt hold up the unit in place like o wanted to and this soon dropped too low to stay up from the elastic band wearing down too fast and not way to tighten it down

every beard is different and i wish i had one like chris stapleton but unfortunately i dont i like the groomed and tailored beard set but my beard is not quite there yet i love the quality of the items and especially like the scissors the three tools come in a cloth bag
this is a great cleaner for getting stickers and what not off of flat or slightly curved surfaces  the included razor scraper makes very quick work or any stubborn stickers  we used it to remove registration stickers in the cars and to remove some old vinyl clings from some windows  scraper holds the blades firmly and prevents slips and accidental cuts
it doesnt not blink in any way that is described in the listing absolute waste of money
ginseng has delivered several beneficial results morning sickness pickled ginseng from the grocery refrigerated section and supplements keep it at bay monotonous low energy ginsengginsenosides are a natural steroid group exclusive to the panax genus of ginseng it acts as an antiinflammatory 23 concentrations are natural in panax 10 would be a 3x concentrationalways reliable nice value seems like a quality source
i have been using this for a hot minute 1 tablespoon on an empty stomach will get your there quick remember that kava is fat soluble so take it with almond or coconut milk not a bad bang for your buck
the smell does not last for more than 30 minutesi bought it for my new zealand wool dryer ballsi think it is rather expensive for its poor qualitybut the smell is nice
make sure you want this as it is not returnable even though it says it is when you order it
works great next to our kitty litter box quiet and efficient highly recommend
if you want something healthy this is iti use the super chlorella powder when i make a smoothy in my vitamixthe taste of chlorella is not the best to just drink it alone i add organic frozen cherrys part of a apple carrot celery bananaeven cabbage and iceim not a coffee drinker but this drink gets me going in the morning or a fast drink during the dayi really cannot find anything i do not like about this chlorella powderits organic high in a b12  cracked cellseasier to absorbno wheatno gluten
i have been wanting to check my ph levels as i have been having stomach issues so when this item was made available to me for a reduced price for my honest opinion and review i jumped on it  the first day i tested my saliva along with my urine and both tested the same around 55 which means my system is acidic a range of ph 6575 is perfect  ph below 65 is to acidic and a level above 75 is to alkaline the ph of a person is very informative as to what is going on inside your body if your ph is to acidic you can experience fatigue headaches and many other symptoms  if you system is to alkaline that can cause joint pain nerve pain insomnia and other issues  by daily monitoring your ph levels you can get your range in the perfect spot by adjusting your diet  i just checked  my levels for today and i am now in that sweet spot  these test strips work great they come with a ph chart on the label and a printed copy with directions this is fast and easy to useyou get results in 15 seconds this bottle contains 200 strips  thank you to healthy wiser for allowing me to try their product
this disney bag is soooo cute
my lips have never been in such a good condition no more lines and peeling i just cant say enough about this product its like silk on your lips but most of all it works
ive been looking for an organic dandelion and milk thistle supplement and there were no many choices that have both in them i am sensitive  to alot of things whether it be supplements or food i have not had any adverse reactions to these but i do not take take them everyday i have a peace of mind to know i am taking a supplement without some type of pesticide or chemical used
this is the worst tooth floss i have ever used  you will be able to clean between two teeth before it breaks even if you double it up it still breaks very very thin  it would be good for hanging christmas decorations  it would be impossible to floss your whole mouth with one strand without it breaking
impressed that it actually works and relieves my pain
i use this to make a muesli for breakfast i like that its organic
the plastic seal was broken also the twist seal on the lid was damaged not on the grooves of the bottle completely so when i twisted to open it the entire thing came off this seems to be what caused the oil to leak out in the packaging about 15 of the bottle it smelled strongly of lime when i opened the box so i knew immediately it had leaked regarding the scent it is refreshing and a pleasant lime smell i would have given this 5 stars if it wouldnt have leaked
bought these for my son who loves them
best powder ever  no longer getting a rash under my chest  will always purchase and use especially in hot weather

my son is a doodler and this was perfect for him
i wasnt sure what to expect with this as i usually take pills for my b12  the taste is good  my only real complaint is a dropperful is supposed to be 1ml but i have yet to be able to get the full 1ml in the dropper  the most i can get it to go is to 75ml
its fine closes securely and doesnt pop open like i feared and i leave it in my bag while i haul it all over campus books and laptop hitting iti initially worried about the pills mixing into each other because it doesnt look like the divider reaches to top of the case but it wasnt a problem for me i have fairly small pills but if yours are particularly small id do a shake test on itunintuitive to clean its hard to get into all the corners but thats inherent in this type of case i just didnt think about that before i bought itblack case isnt fully opaque like youd think it would be and the  sign is mostly transparent if you want to hide the contents not the case for you
after not finding a cure for waking up every night at 3am not 259 or 301 and finding that ambien was actually not suited for me i sought the help of an alternative medical doctor has all the sheepskin of an official practitioner but leans heavily on homeopathic and new age medicine i highly recommend this type of medicine esp if you are menopausal and your doc wants to prescribe synthetic medshe told me to google the chinese medicine wheel and at or around 3am i would find whatmy ailment was  it was an issue with my liver  he had me use hepa trope take one twice a day  after 2 days of hepa trope i slept through the night  no ambien hangover or eyes popping open at 3am  i am on my 2nd bottle and still take it almost everydayhe sells this in his office but he is 45 minutes from me plus the amazon price is a bit friendlier and arrives in a couple of days
i use 6 diffusers throughout our home daily and i spend a small fortune on essential oils i have used the same company for years and i never thought i could be swayed to like oils from any other company until i tried the oils in salty essential oils i tried the lemon in my hall bathroom because it was a smaller space and i wanted to see if i could smell the oil  it was fantastic i tried this same experiment with the frankincense and bergamot fabulous the scents last after the diffuser has run out as i write this i have been enjoying orange in my living room i love that each oil has an explanation of what it can be used forexample sleep headache etc what an unexpected pleasure this product has brought to me i am so glad i ordered it
arrived on time easy to use accurate a great product im ordering these again
is what was suspected
this works incredibly well for smelly shoes if you follow the directions i washed my boots and they started smelling a couple days later so i tried this for several days and it worked  i was skeptical because this is not a chemical product but it works really really well  and smells great  i also love that it doesnt leave any powder residue in the shoes like other products on the market
comfortable easy to use provides support
it does what is suppose to
i like that i can wear this tens unit even when im out shopping  the main machine fits in my pocket easilysetting it up is easy  just need to take the time to find the best mode and intensity to suit your needssome areas i can do stronger intensity while other areas a lighter tough is neededthis has so many modes to choose from  i personally love the deep tissue  works great and feels so good on my back when i pull a certain musclegives enough pads to last awhileone of the better tens unit ive tried
works amazing on my pandora jewelry but the cleaner does smell like eggs as long as u rinse off the jewelry after using the cleaner the smell goes away and they look amazing
did nothing
my favorite thing about this is the button that you push to pop open the lid  its well made so should be durable
highly recommended
overall i am impressed with the effectiveness of these s they are intended silky waterproof like material on one side and soft fleecy material on the other they are meant for low flow which i am really only most comfortable with using it for very light days so please keep that in mind i always wear a liner for various reasons i am using these for that purpose they do not leak there is no odor that i have notices and the material is so soft and comfortable my lady bits like the fleecy feel when done i toss it in the wash or hand wash depending on what i feel likewhile the liners stayed put in a manner that kept me covered  do notice some shifting i am larger in size so underwear is larger and it seems that these were quite loose i think a second button snap right along the first to make more narrow andor a second set to also help keep it in place right now it is one snap loose fit it may not be limited to these this may be the norm this is my first experience with reusable cloths i really like the idea and while i am not ready to fully swap out i can comfortable using these in place of my daily liner or paired with a resuable menstrual cup but for flow i am not there yet in terms of confidence
overall this is a pretty decent mop and bucket set  the mop is excellent the pole is metal and the sections thread together well the threaded portion is recessed into each section making for a very durable solid connection that wont come apart or loosen when using the mop the mop head is not threaded but it has a good quality snap button attachment  the only moprelated complaint i have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic its a decent quality thick plastic but metal would have been nice since thats a strain point on the mopthe mop head covers are of good quality and attach well with velcro to the mop head two pads are provided in the set while they can be machine washed its better to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat it reduces the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machinethe bucket design could have been better it is smaller than another similar product that i have which is actually a positive since it weighs less when full of water however it lacks some key convenience features such as a popopen drain at the base it is also not possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use the overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat lightweight especially the handle it lacks the heft and durability of other similar productswhile the bucket issues brings my score to 4 stars this is still a very good performing set its easy to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a spring that allows it to automatically fold vertically so it can be inserted into the bucket the squeegee on the dry side does a good job of wringing out the water the ability to have a wet and a dry side to the bucket makes mopping quicker easier and results in a better jobnot perfect but a decent value for the price
holds a lot of stuff in our small rv very well made too only thing is our headrest is one piece and it is a tight connect
these arent returnable so think carefully before you choose to buy them i bought them to replace an old ace bandage but they are so short slippery and weak   i went back to using the old ace bandage  i think i will donate these and then go buy another bandage  waste of time and money
i ordered this by mail when i was away from home to be sure it would be waiting for me when i returned  these vitamins are recommended by health care professionals for women

wore this on flights in january when flu season was rampant finally stayed well no flu or uri first time flying without getting sick in three years
when toilet paper became so scarce at the beginning of the pandemic i ordered a bidet sprayer httpswwwamazoncomgpproductb01e4h7dta to cut down on tp use then all i had to worry about was using just enough tp to dry off then i got these washable bamboo makeup removers that fit nicely in a little ceramic pot on the back of my toilet and they work great for drying off not only that when used with a lowsudsing feminine wash i can wash my private parts as needed and cut down on how often i waste water bathingfor someone who is retired with little activity and very dry skin there really is no need to bathe more than once a week as long as the privates are washed daily i like that i can do this while sitting on the toilet and not risk a fall i have osteoporosis getting in and out of the tub besides i hear a number of celebrities are now advocating not bathing very frequently so i must be cooli got two packs of 16 makeup removers each and each pack comes with a nice mesh bag for washing the rounds in the washing machine so i keep a bag beside the toilet to hold the ones ive used and when the clean ones are all gone i just start on the second pack while the other is in the wash the little bit of soap left on each used round prevents it from getting groady until wash timeim very very pleased with this product and id give it an extra star if i could for the washing bag
we do not use anything else nothing compares love it just a bit more expensive but worth it hair doesnt get sticky goes on light  i do wish there was no odor daughter freaks out about breathing it in tell her it is good stuff but she doesnt like it so sometimes i am chasing that head around
im an adult and i use baby lotion as recommended by my doctor for myself because of how incredibly sensitive and incredibly dry my skin is in my quest to find a lotion that does not make my skin hurt this almost worked my skin reacted to it minimally but this stuff isnt hydrating at all when you put it on it feels pretty good but a halfhour later my skin feels just as dry as before i do however use the sweet apple body wash and that has been a gamechanger best body wash ive ever used but the lotion is a miss for me

batteries it is rather cute in appearance to me and it comes with a one year warranty replacement parts can be hard to get if one is attempting to order direct however aeroflowbreastpumpscom carries motif medical replacement parts the pump comes with no accessories if you need a tote and cooler youll have to purchase your own warranty on the pump is one year from date of purchase or received through insurancewhats included 4 valves and membranes 2 wide neck bottles ml volume only with nipples and hard plastic sealing disc 2 one piece flanges with comfort cushions  caps flanges included is the standard 24mm only 1 ac power adapter 2 sets of tubingpros twist is a closed pump meaning there is a barrier usually a diaphragm that prevents milk and condensation from entering the tubing small and lightweight which makes for high portability its far lighter than my avent double electric comfort pump and that too is far lighter than other double electric pumps parts is interchangeable with the motif curve flanges is rather light in comparison to other full one piece bodies comfort cushion makes for one of the most comfortable pumping experiences twist has two phase expression when the pump is turned on it starts in the letdown phase where it replicates the faster suckling a baby would do to get milk flowing turning the dial up enters the expression phase when expressing i noted that higher suction has a longer pull on the nipple with some hacks flangesflange bodies can be used from other closed pumps other bottles than can be pumped into is avent classicnatural and dr browns wide neck bottle this is only if using motif flanges twist is a double electric pump allowing mom to express from both breast at the same timecons pump is loud its comparable to avent double electric comfort pump in terms of loudness motif only carries a 24mm flange and a 28mm flange parts is hard to get at this time what i noted is only aeroflowbreastpumpscom carrying all of motif replacement parts one must use motif brand valves and membranes or duckbill valves the flange opening where the valve would go is far smaller than medela so trying to use medela valvemembranes or third party ones from nene supplymayomom will not work with the motif twist flanges tubing is double ended which forces a lactating mom to use motif parts  i did a hack and cut one of the ends off allowing for me to use flangeflange bodies from other companies i also noted that the tubing is rather soft and has some stretch to it allowing for me to remove the excess plastic from the end for use with spectra tubing thus far i was able to use my avent comfort flanges and my medela personal fit connectors with pumpinpals flanges with the motif twist 60 most commercial single user breast pumps use vacuum technology so flanges can be used interchangeably between brands62  this is a personal con which may not be across the board for all moms vaccum sucks the nipple and areola in well and creates good suction i noted this phenomenon between three different company flanges where removing the flange from the breast is a bit of a task and has sort of a pop like noise from the release i dont have this feeling when using electric breast pumps from other companies motif medical only has monday through friday customer service from 8am5pm estupdate 172018i called motifs customer service asking about replacement parts and a larger flange size please understand that cutting the tubing to use different company flanges can and will void out your warranty parts is covered for 3m and motor is one year according to the warranty i was informed that a 32mm flange is in the works and should be available soon this year i was sent two 28mm flanges and extra valvemembranes although i have been using size 30mm flanges for most of my pumping career i recently changed out to size 28mm to note that i am able to express well with the size 30mm may be more comfortable for me to use with no chances of my nipple hitting the back of the flangesmotif has an interesting flange for size 28mm the body and flange is separate from each other the diaphragms i noted is bigger than what is included with the 24mm flange its a small pot and is far deeper than the 24mm ones 24mm flange has a shallow pot diaphragm  the flange is also shaped like a pot it covers all of my areola and is quite comfortable its far more comfortable than medela in my opinion i also decided to change valves from the two piece valvemembrane thing most companies put out i switched to a third party duckbill valve from nenesupply also sold on amazon and noted that it fits onto the flanges and work well the valvemembrane combination doesnt offer good suction thus i need a higher vacuum to express with maymom another third party after market retailer also sold on amazon carries a thread changer which also works well with motif flanges with the thread changer i was able to express into medela and ameda narrow neck bottles just fine the thread changer only works properly with duckbill valves that arent avent  avent style valves one cannot express with using the thread  thread also works well with the two piece valvemembrane combinationoverall i would recommend the twist its a high quality pump and i personally respond to it well flanges are quite comfortable to use and the pump is extremely light weight the pump is rather loud but its no louder than other pumps close to its size replacement parts may be hard to obtain but aeroflow carries them as well as a call to customer service one can get them third party duckbill valves work with motif flanges and the 28mm flanges is easy to cleanupdate 372018i recently went looking for replacement parts only to note that 1 motif updated their website to include a parts store 2 the 28mm flange was updated 32 is still not available neither is a full flange size 21mm or 19mm currently the insert for the 24mm flange reduces the flange down to a 21mm there is an insert for the 28mm flange however i was informed via customer service that its only for added comfort and it doesnt change the flange sizethe 28mm flange is now a single one piece body with a shallow pot diaphragm it was changed as i was told the old version was more expensive to produce than the current model the new 28mm flange has a very similar appearance to the 24mm flange included with the pump i have yet to receive and use the new model but i shall soon and update this review againupdate 3272018i recently called motif customer service as my pump is still under warranty for parts i inquired about the 28mm flanges i was sent another set of flanges though with shipping one of my flanges arrived broken  its no big deal as the original set i was sent is still functioning just fine motif has not changed their 28mm flanges its still a two piece item with a larger pot diaphragm  the parts store shows a replacement diaphragm being the same size as it is for the 24mm flange from what i am seeing via photos and what originally came with my pump the 24mm flange body has a  shallower pot for the diaphragm parts store claims the flanges both 24mm and 28mm use the same size diaphragm but such is not the case as one is far bigger than the other there is still no other flange size out side of 24mm and 28mm 28mm flange now has an insert i have not used nor ordered as the flange is very comfortable to usestill i would recommend the pump for mamas who use the available flange sizes its still a high quality pump and i believe it performs far better than my spectra s2 and my medela pisa  pump in style advance customer service is good and motif makes quality breast pumpsupdate 09122018i recently noted that motif medical has taken to offering their replacement parts and flanges on amazon we can not order breast flange kits with valvesmembranes and tubing included breast flange inserts replacement valvesmembranes diaphragms extra flanges and so on is now sold on here making it convenient to get partsmy pump now being 8m old is currently in the process of being replaced after doing routine maintenance of replacing tubing duckbills  i dont respond well to the valvemembrane combo so i dont use them  and diaphragms monthly i noted that my pump is no longer able to provide me with adequate suction even when increasing the suction on the pump with daily use of three plus times a day it is past its prime as with other pumps ive replaced in the past the old motor will be sent back in exchange for  the new motor i never used the pump as a double as for me i noted that it doesnt perform well as such i always used my pump as a single and on ac power never battery using any pump as a double kills the vacuum strength thus motor is worked harder and mom would need to use higher suction overall i would still recommend this pump for moms on the go now that parts is easier to get and the fact the pump is reasonably priced even when its on sale
shipping was incredibly fast and i actually received three thank goodness because one broke as i was learning to use it and the other got deformed when i finally got it in it makes a gorgeous bun but the product is not sturdy enough for multiple uses
i needed a new shaker bottle and decided to give this one a try  ive used this for a few days now and i am very satisfied with my purchase  its leakproof which is good considering i throw it in my gym bag  the blender ball works just as well as any other blender ball out there  i really like the nonslip grip that they put on the sides finger grove area and the bottom of the bottle  it really helps with not dropping the bottle when there is condensation all over it  my only wish is that there was a ring or a loop or something on the bottle to make it a little easier to hold
works fine and the price is good id buy this again
this stuff tastes great and helps me thru my workouts
beautiful color and big flakes i love this product if i ever run out i will buy more without hesitation
this is a beautiful copper magnetic bracelet ive only worn it for a day and havent had any pain in my fingers like i do at times ill update as i notice anything i received a discount for an honest review
love the packaging for travel since a little goes a long way you will probably get more from this pouch than you thinkeasy to dispense doesnt irritate my dry  sensitive skin has a slight scent that fades quickly  didnt trigger any migraines always a win from something with fragrancethe lotion itself is nice easy to blend into the skin makes my skin feel pretty nice the best part though is definitely the packaging besides being travel  storage space friendly you dont have to put your fingers into a jar and so youre not contaminating the rest of the lotion every time you use it
i have purchased quite a few different supplements and had some free sample sizes from bulk supplements over the last few years horsetail is a herb i have heard about but never thought seriously adding it to my regimen until recently listening to a video on alternative dentistry horsetail is the goto herb for healthy teeth and gums i ordered the herb from bulk supplements and began to take 1teaspoon a day the color of the powder is brown and the taste tolerable i was concerned about the quality and freshness though after taking it for 2 weeks i couldnt tell one way or the other if it was having any effect at all in the meantime i decided to order the same herb through another well known company that only sells fresh dried herbs oils etc organically grow and american made it arrived today this new one is like night and day it is green and smells earthyfresh it is still just tolerable to taste but that is pretty typical with herbs i chuck it back with just enough water to get it down then chase with at least a cup of purified water so sorry bs but your product just doesnt pass the quality test with this particular herb i wouldnt recommend it and i plan on purchasing other herbs from the other company because i know it is high quality
this is like putting white out on your teeth  dont waste your money
update  01062021had to get my hands on the new flavors tried the sample pack and loved them great tasting with the same buzzoriginal reviewim no stranger to caffeine as someone who has always taken preworkouts and drank energy drinks i have a pretty high tolerance to the stuff im always on the lookout to try new products and came across this sample pack of neus three flavors and figured id give it a whirlthe three shots arrived quickly to my door and i waited for the right moment to try the first one all the flavors were good but i personally liked the original tropical punch the best green i took the first shot before a night out and it worked great the stuff is smooth and i felt a lift in my mood about 15 mins after taking it its nice because the 2oz shot doesnt leave you full of liquid just crazy good energy i felt great all night and had zero crash which was exactly what i was looking fori find that the 300mg of caffeine is the sweet spot for me its enough to get me going and not too much where i feel too jittery this product hits that sweet spot perfectly it also has other ingredients like b12 and choline for an additional brain boost overall the formula is strong the product looks amazing and the flavors are greati would highly recommend trying these out for your next night out on the town study session or in the office as a pick me up
i dont like the coconut milk in my coffee or tea but i use this whenever light coconut milk is mentioned in a recipe this is a good alterative to buying cans of coconut milk which i use up easily  this 8 oz resealable packet will last me a long time while the canned milk is undeniably thicker and creamier adding warm water to this powdered version still yields enough rich coconut flavor to be satisfactory for my thai dishes i add a spoonful of red or green curry to a frying pan add in the prepared light coconut milk add some ginger lemongrass etc and i have a delicious curry sauce its also nongmo and vegan which is great i wish id known about this product earlier i would have stopped having to buy cans all the time
i have used this every day for the last 5 months and i love it  i have a suv and it still fills the air with the wonderful scent of my essential oils
very easy to attach to glasses very comfortable
quality for a decent price
great little things for small messes and small hands
these bags were perfect for the job i needed them for  i have a tin and treats i put in these bags and it worked ut perfectly  i would buy again maybe not sturdy for some jobs but perfect for this one
i am loving this facial brush i use it in the shower with face wash and so far so good im glad i could get rid of using a washcloth it is made of a soft silicone so not damaging to my skin it also suctions to the shower wall i washed it in the dishwashing machine without any issues
these scales are accurate and hold up well with 4 women using them on a daily basis they are a breeze to move around and super easy to read even in the dark theyre black and sleek which adds to their appeal this was a good purchase
when it comes to winter sometimes we dont always have access to the vegetables that we want to have  i love to have juice but sometimes it just is not possible to get fresh vegetables at times  having this powder is a great alternativewhat is this powder likethis powder comes in a great packaging which seems to keep the powder dry very nicely  it is cut open and then you can reseal it  the powder is raw beets but is freeze dried so you have to keep this closed at all times before and after you access ithow do i use iti either put this in my vegetable juice that i make fresh and blend it in my hand blender or if desperate i add it to cold water and drink it in my mini blender  i also have used it to make a keto version of red forest cake which is out of this world by the way  you just have to add more liquid to counteract the powderthe bottom linefor a great way to get beet juice into your diet when vegetables are not handy this is an excellent alternative  the powder is easy to use tastes fresh and mixes well either in fresh juice or water or you can use it in recipes toomy ratingfive stars  i love how versatile it is and between the juice and red forest keto cake i am most likely going to keep this in my cupboard when i run out i will buy more
i bought the cleats mainly because it came with the tool but the tool is too small and not sturdy enough to remove cleats from a golf  at first i used pliers to get some torque on the cleat but it didnt work  i ended up buying a softspikes cleat kaddy which was very easyif you want great cleats buy this item but not for the tool
i purchased this replacement bulb for my slvr410  this is not the same model as the slv410  the bulbs i ordered and received had the plug on the outside of the ring rather than the inside of the ring and were unusable  that said i went straight to the manufacturer and they explained the problem to me and sent me the correct bulb for the slvr410 which is replacement part number fb681
im pleased with these vitamin c gummies they have a light citrus taste thats very pleasant the consistency is perfect  soft enough to easily chew but not something that sticks to my teeth the gummies are covered with granular sugar which keeps them from sticking to one another even in humid weatherthe vitamin c content is decent with each serving of 2 gummies providing 240mg thats not as high as other gummies but for me its a good dosage level the echinacea content is pretty low at 35mg per serving still i use these for the vitamin c so the echinacea is more like a bonus than something i find essential to have the price is a little high but not out of range for a 60 count bottleoverall score of 45 stars ill round up to 5 since im so pleased with the taste and consistency
i got what i needed to wake up and get out to my commute while its still dark  i am the poster child for 34not a morning person34  this makes it happen
i have to be careful with these or they give me a terrific headache be careful of taking with anything else
i purchased this case to protect my oils for an upcoming move overseas i love the print that i chose and the extras that came with it it seems to be a pretty sturdy case holds all of my oils perfectly the 5ml bottles are a tad bit loose in the slots but thats not a problem right now the 15ml bottles fit very snug which is perfect i will try to remember to update after my flight to let you guys know whether the case protected the oils or not
i like that these are soft packaging easy to carry in your car purse anywhere good value  why soft on the skin would buy again
did nothing at all for my milk supply  stick with straight fenugreek
received this for my wifeshes been using it for about a month now and reports that its a good trimmer  she regularly uses it for legs and armpits and that other area  good for legarmpits all year round as well as winter maintenance in the other areashe does say that you if you have darkthick hair you still need to wax if youre going to the beachpool  but lightfair hair will probably not need tomy electric shaver was out of power and i used it on my face  thankfully it worked  i see it as revenge since i know shes been using my electric shaver without my permission
this is an easy and effective way to ice an injured area i use it on my leg where i was injured and also  it works greats on leg cramps at night the roller part stays in the freezer for when you need it  you just pop on the roller to the handle and its ready to go it rolls easily and smoothly and then when you are done it cleans up easily the roller stays icy cold for plenty of time  i have yet to run out of cold while using  the handle fits my hand nice and it it comfortable to hold and use the roller rolls smooth this also works great when i have neck pain or a migraine
these were nice enough but i did notice some cosmetic defects in the surface on 2 of the 3  disappointed with that
this is great in my basement bath where we keep an xl litter box for 2 cats i was impressed will be purchasing 2 more units to put in other areas of the basement highly recommend
these are fantastic i take 9 pills a daythree different times of the day i also have neuropathy in my hands due to past chem infusions it was difficult to open that many pill bottles throughout the day these are super easy to open and easy to fill  i also recently took them on a cruise with me and they were wonderful and traveled well i highly recommend these
awful dont waste your money i purchased this amp it didnt last a full year everything i did to clean per instructions still will not work i will never purchase from this company again
great product fast delivery
ive gone back to natural nails and needed files for them i knew the 240 would be okay and was hoping the 180 would work it does the job but i only use the 180 side for shortening my nails its a bit rough and isnt at all good for shaping that being said the 240 is what i was looking for and its easy enough to tell the difference so you dont use the wrong side
the photos were misleading it comes with one sheet and it is thick too
comfortable and as advertised you can still hear everything just that really loud sounds are blocked and reduced in volume i use them several days a week and have had no problems with them recommended
these work great the are long enough to wash dishes and do other household cleaning you get 2 pair in different  colors so you wont get the ones for the bathroom mixed up with kitchen gloves they keep your hands clean and do a wonderful job
the plates are extra tiny and super flimsy cups are also very small the banners are cute napkins are fine but overall the set is pretty disappointing
easily adjustable not too tight and changes sizes easily
the only reason this cane holder gets a single star is due to the fact there is no way to assign a zero star  the manufacturer and seller should be embarrassed to sell this item due to its poor construction lack of instructions and poor design  do not purchase thisits a total waste of money
i purchased these for my dad got him two pair  these really help with circulation of the feet this company has several other sleeve braces that are very comfortable and help with circulationmy first one was for my knee after surgery my arthopedic said no braces well these are not braces but sleevesi originally heard from the people who invented this material that our soldiers in afghanistan used them to help circulate blood to their feet to help them feel warm in the cold desert night  they could not wear anything that generated real heat because it would make their feet sweat and in the cold air not goodi was getting foot cramps and these helped my sleep better at night  i know you are supposed to wear them with your shoes which i did but found them more comfortable at night to make my feet feel warm not hoti will tell you my knee healed faster than expected which was great since i travel for work and need to walk alot  i noticed my knee didnt get as tired so i got a set for both kneesthen i got the socks too  not just these but the ones that go above the knee  then i got one for the elbow  yeah im that jacked upi know the quality of these and have recommended to facebook friends who live across the country told them if you dont like them you can return them  they had similar knee surgerythey had similar experience and also got the socks odd the knee and foot issues seem to go hand in hand or foot in footthey to have recommended this brand to their friends  when i see someone hobbling around i ask then tell them google incrediwear read the reviews then order on amazon
this is an amazing toothbrush i have metal in my lower bottom gums with holes to snap into the teeth i went looking on amazon and found this amazing product they keep help get the food out i will be a couple more because they come from another country and it takes a little longer to get them so i will buy two more
these delightful brittle  do i call them a candy or a cookie  are different and tasty  only problem is i want to eat the whole bag at one time  i prefer the chocolate chip to the other flavors but im sure thats a preference and not a reflection on the product
seriously i love this thing  i hate washing and fixing my hair because it takes forever as i have very thick wavy hair that holds moisture  it takes me at least an hour to blow dry usually still damp at the back of my scalp and straighten my hair  ive taken to using dry shampoo for 3 and 4 days to avoid washing and doing the process all over again  well this brush solves all my problems  the day after i got it i took a shower at night letting my hair air dry a little bit before bed  when i woke the next morning it was pretty gnarly looking think janis joplin i sprayed it with my heat protectant and hit it with the blowdryer for roughly 5 minutes just to make sure it was completely dry that underneath layer was still damp  i cranked the brush up to 450f while i was blow drying and she was ready by the time i was done  i brushed my hair thoroughly to make sure there were no knots to snag  then the miraculous occurred i think i heard a heavenly choir singing  i slowly brushed the first section of my hair  there was no strange pulling no scalding piece of hair to hold no weird kinks against my scalp but it was straight  oh wonder of wonders miracle of miracles  i did one side and then decided i needed to document this process  i went and got dressed must wear a bra for the public good and grabbed my phone to take a few pictures  i started with the brush at 708 and with wardrobe changes and selfies i ended at 722  say what  this brush is my new best friend  i didnt get any finger burns from lava hot hair i even picked out a few stray hairs from the brush while it was on and it didnt burn me what is this sorcery  this brush is amazing and i kind of want to kiss it  if i never buy another hair appliance again i will be totally ok with that  i love this thing almost as much as i love my first kindle
i have a 6mo old and a 3yr old and have one of these germguardian sanitizers in each of their rooms we hardly every get sick i would like to think these sanitizers play a part in that they make just enough noise to act as a noisemaker as well as put off just enough light to act as a night light very dim one they seem to do a decent deal for removing odor baby diapers from their roomsi have had one of these sanitizers in my older kids room for about a year and half and it is still working great had to replace the bulb once i got a really good deal on the ones i bought on amazon most of the time they are overpriced so wait and you can get a decent deal on these sanitizers if the price drops again i will get one for my room
i knew the items included in this package would be small and they sure were  but it is a nice selection of things to try and then i could purchase bigger products of the things i liked the best  it would make a nice gift also for someone who likes to mess with their nails

fast shipping and great product
this is one longlasting unit  it has taken on some small room issues  vocs other odors  and puts out a very very insignificant green light  ive used it in powder rooms and most recently a college students bedroom that has accumulated dirty laundry  very pleased with this purchase and am about to buy another oneive tried several negativeion generators some with  without fans some ozone generators etc for several years and have found that those with filtersfans tend to die after a few years of constant use even with filter maintenance  the fans of these units not the germguardian tend to finally die  the smaller ozone generators are wonderful but ive found that some of the brands are all but impossible to clean and thusly lose their effectiveness after a year or so  the one of these small units im still crazy about isnt being sold by amazon at this time
good detergent great value we purchased it to try to get a stain out of a pocelain sink it didnt help with that but it is a wonderful laundry dey
same as i was using
great price for two and does the job
my kids love them and im quite sure well continue to use them into adulthood  i should  buy stock
i wish this product  was available years ago this is the most amazing product for mosquito bites im the one thats bit  in my family im always getting bit and scratch like crazy if you use this right away you too will be  amazed that it worked so well the itching will be gone there was still swelling but it did not itch its so simple to use i actually have the original namebrand one and i prefer this one better because the finger loops make it easier to use i cannot say enough positive things about this product the price is excellent  especially since you get three of them i keep one on my purse and one in the car and another in the first aid kit this is one purchase you will not regret
this is not a production unit  its a portable easily transportable light weight simple fairly durable unit  for a homeowner handyman or light commercial its very nice  im an electrician for the low end carpentry i need to do my work this is perfect
love it
it was a gift so i dont know details but it was a pretty color
ive done some research on the health benefits of fisetin but cant really find a lot about it  it hasnt had many studies and the results of the ones done werent very conclusive  but the reason i selected this product for review was not for the fisetin content but the quercetin  quercetin is absolutely wonderful at getting zinc into cells to fight off and kill viruses  it really goes very well with vitamin c d3 and zinc and i take all of those daily
great product
i got a free sample of the dragonfruit flavor it tastes like how a bandaid smells i cant think of how else to describe it i didnt realize it was a healthy drink when i popped the can open and just thought it was another brand of lacroixesque sparkling waters after the first foul tasting sip i looked at the can to see exactly what i was drinking after seeing that it claims to be good for you i decided to give it another go i couldnt get past sip number 2 truly one of the worst tasting beverages ive tasted
ever since the pandemic began we have been taking d3 pills religiously however not all of them are created equal these are very good however and are easy to swallow leave no bad aftertaste in your mouth and are small enough they dont choke the mrs most of all they are strong enough 5000ius to keep pretty much any nasty germ at bay granted its not guaranteed to prevent you from catching covid but every little bit helps right we havent gotten the virus yet knock on wood so we will maintain our regime and take these for as long as it takes to be safe again good health to you
i fell several weeks ago and hurt my seat but consequently my legs hurt since then too  i bought this to help cushion my seat at work but its thick and hurts my legs on the edge  i have to return the item because it wasnt comfortable for me
seriously im writing a review about ear plugs theyre that great i have very sensitive hearing and even moderate noise sometimes makes my eardrums hurt i always carry one pair of these around with me keep one in the car etc just in case i need them theyre very comfortable and dont get irritating they cancel enough noise that i can feel at ease enough sleep but if i wear them loosely i could still have a conversation with someone at dinner they are fairly discrete and the little cases are great too ive used these for almost a year now whether its sitting in a coffee shop or traveling on a plane if you are in the market for ear plugs look no further seriously these are awesome and so comfy
i did a bit of research after one of the morning news shows talked about uv lights this little plugin was pretty inexpensive so i ordered it for an area that has puppy pads it did the job and was pretty quiet its nice to know that the uv bulb is replaceablei just ordered another one to place in the bathroomupdate it was pointed out to me that the plug turns so it can accommodate both sides of an outlet thanks to merry c
loved the idea off having earplugs attached to a cord for easy access but plug come out and wont go back in i cant really notice a huge noise difference between these and regular ear plugs my voice and the patients is very muffled i have to take off my gloves after using the cavitron to hold a conversation
just what i needed
its an okay ice pack gets too hard once in freezer for more than a couple hours not my favorite
fast results that are clear no dye run issues
i bought this some time ago as an amazon today deal this is such a wonderful spray i could not afford the 29 dollars but it is worth every cent here is hoping for another todays deal
i really like these lens cleaners the moisture is perfect they dont leave my lenses with streaks ive tried other wipes and they left streaks on my lenses because they were too wet
the lavender smells amazing  i love the little towel that comes with it  great investment for your mat
i have used these several times now it fully blocks the light while being very conformable  it worked for me laying down in bed and sitting up on a very early flight it let me get the best sleep i have ever had on a plane the soft silk does not add any distraction like other sleep masks i have tried
like most stain removers this one works best on fresh stains  for example if you just spilled wine on your blouse five minutes ago this remover worked but then so does seltzer if you apply enough of it when i tried it on an old stain a pair of jeans that had a spot on it from grease it didnt do anything the small bottle is handy for travel however so its good for when youre on the go overall its good for mild stains that just happened and you dont have anything else on hand for more stubborn stains id use something else
makes nice bubbles and the message is good
but it isnt waterproof so your medication could melt away if you get caught in rain it will work and most of us arent caught in the rain all day everyday so they can work you could also put little mouth fresheners or gum in them too when open you also have a mirror bright interior lid to look in for fast fix ups
i felt very hard to use and plucks hair
great supply of various popular sizes of watch band pins
the four pack of bamboo bath sponges are a great deal i go through a few every year and this fourpack will keep me stocked soft mesh and shower gel foams up nicely when using they have a nice ribbon to hook them for draining
good quality and good price  good for adults and children
does not work almost seemed to attract more cats i would not recommend buying this
i use it for everything its the best
this type of supplement is very good for you and the supplier is awesome you can curb your appetite have clean skin and have your hair grow very long from using this
i am always looking for ways to curb my appetite so i thought i would give these a try you are to take so many pills each day i think that is hard to remember to take them and with the smell it is hard to force yourself to do but i was determined to give it a fair shake i did take them for a week and i did notice that it helped my appetite i am not sure if that is because of what is in them or because of the terrible smell who wants to eat after you have smelled that it did work though so you have to give some stars for that i defiantly noticed that i was going to the bathroom more often do the detox part worked as well this is not something i could add or take for my regular routine but if you are looking for a way to loose a few pounds or a way to detox for  a week or so this would work
the first thing i love about this flat iron is that its cordless  its so nice to slowly getting rid of all of the power cords in my bathroomsthe iron itself is nice  heats up fastthe only thing i dont like is the size of the heating plate  im used to a longer one in my older flat iron so its taking me a bit to get used to this onesince i only straighten my bangs and every so often my entire head of hair the charge will last me a long time before i need to recharge it againnice flat iron thats easy to pack up and take on the go
i love these oil but they raised the price  this is not greasy and good for skin  great for senaitive skin
pretty rough and started to unravel on second use pretty color but thats about it

i mixed up some of this today with cold water and milk with some ice cubes  it mixed very well  i gave my wife a taste she is pickier than i am on these things  she liked it  we both liked iti appreciate very much that it is made in the usa  i really appreciate the grams of fiber along with added vitaminsthe only concern i have is the price to reorder when it runs out  at almost two dollars a serving it is higher than the others i drink  but then again this one has fiber and i dont think any of my other ones dowe like it and will continue to drink it
ridiculous  1 sheet will not wash anything  use 15 sheets maybe
i have been using this clear care product to clean and disinfect my contacts for years  it was recommended to me by my eye doctor when i was diagnosed with an eye infection i have not had an infection in the many years i have been using it i gave it 4 stars because the double pack only comes with one of the required cases i think there should be a case for each bottle included
very deceiving as there was nothing stating that they would poorly paint rubber and glue it to mediocre glass
well packaged arrived early great price and smells lovely
there are 30 shimmery champagne gold boxes and 6 pages of 20 clear stickers totaling 120 stickers that come with this set they come in one piece and fold into a midsized boxi finally figured out how to fold the box bottom correctly the tabbed flaps go on the outside of the bottom and interlock into the other flaps they are not very sturdy so i suspect that 4 of the 120 stickers should be used to secure the 4 tabs as shown in one of my photosas long as one seals the bottom it should hold these are perfect for christmas gifts no wrapping needed or for cookies cupcakes or other classy gifts  each box should be able to fit about one pound of cookies depending on the size of the cookie or four regularsized cupcakes overall i think these are classy but i do not like the interlocking design of the bottom that requires stickers to provide holdthe current price of 1899 for 30 comes to  63 cents each which is reasonable
when i read this book in the future back when it hasnt been published yet it changed my life  but seriously i already know i will love this book when it becomes available thank you allie for hyperbole and a half and all things created by your wonderful self im super excited to see the new book hope youre doing well
i saw no change with the whitening pen it does have a pleasant taste doesnt work for me
i purchased this toner a few weeks ago i was looking for something that hydrated my skin some toners dry your face out not this one my face felt moist and clean dreamy
great for layout
the spray nozzle does not spray evenly and leaks huge globs of the oil out on to my matit takes a ton of spraying to even cover your mat so i feel like this is going to last maybe 57 usesthe smell is nice and i like that it comes with a microfiber towel but the towel itself is hideous and too bigoverall i do not recommend this product
the packaging was different than what is pictured but i really like the fragrance and the way it lathers  i would love to see it packaged in a glass jar  more for the aesthetic look
ive been using cloverine salve since i was born well my mom did it for me 3 generations cant be wrong  i use it on practically everything except burns until the healing process has started get some its so worth it

this is the chair pad if you sit longer than 10 min per day especially using a computer its well worth the high price for what you get  how it keeps its original shape  form factor over a long period of time

rather wobbily

i ordered some generic eyeglass case from amazon and my gunnar mlg phantoms did not fit in them in the slightest  didnt even know gunnar made an accompanying case but im very happy i stumbled upon these  the quality seems very good theyre made with something like a hard leatherette so it gives it a nice feel  plenty of room inside and i dont feel like my glasses are squished  im considering buying another pair of gunnars and if i do i am absolutely buying another one of these with them
this is a good quality vg for mixing eliquid  ive used this in the past and am quite pleased with it for the price
i like to walk around the neighborhood and pick up trash and this thing is great  i can walk with a bag and a grabber hand and easily keep the bag open to put stuff in it  then it collapses on itself when you let it drop back down like a briefcase so trash doesnt blow out
there fine
in addition to this new linea squeegee i have three oxo shower squeegees two of which are in service at any given time  my favorite  i have been using my  oxo squeegees anywhere from twice daily to once every other day depending on which shower im using and if im taking one or two showers per daythis unit comes in three piecesthe suction cup which has to be screwed into the stainless steel holder the stainless steel holder and the squeegee its features are partial crystallike handle rust proof stainless steel in brushed nickel finish for top of squeegee and suction hook slightly angled neckpros it has a long 10 blade so its great for wiping down my shower walls in a few passes the streamlined design looks sleek and elegant except for the lucitelooking handle the blade wipes smoothly and leaves my walls and shower doors streakfree the suction cup holds hard on my acrylic shower walls the blade appears to be replaceable by loosening two screws it comes with lifetime limited warranty guaranteed rustproof finish will replace if defective etccons to me this is heavy as it weighs in at 65 ounces excluding suction holder the handle looks like lucite or glass and if the suction cup gives way when its hanging i expect it to break when it hits the tub or shower bottom in fact the weight of this thing might nick the bottom of a porcelain tub only time will tell how this holds up the handle is too thin for grasping comfortably i wish the blade head were a little more angledcompared to my other squeegees i actually like this one the least mainly because of the thin fragile handle and the lack of a deeper angled headif i were to rate my preference in squeegees my first choice is the    47 stars and the   this squeegee  i rate 3 stars because the handle needs to be thicker and in stainless steel and the head more angled at the current price of 3999 plus 525 shipping i feel this is overpriced for its current design  nevertheless this squeegee is a looker and for those who have very large showers and baths this 10 blade makes short work of wiping away the water
great task lighting with two slightly different settings adjustable for most positions next to a chair hope the replacement bulb is reasonable when necessary

my daughter is a soccer champ in her own right but megan is her favorite she loves it i do wish they came with a simple stand
unfortunately im returning this item i tried it on and it was fairly simple to figure out how to adjust it it definitely felt like it was pulling my shoulders back and i could instantly feel a bit of relief from my poor posture however once on and snug it cuts into my arm pit area too tightly it may be my size or my sensitivity level im a female 5 1 and weigh about 125 i dont not recommend this product since it seems like it would be effective it just wasnt for me
for years i have heard about the magic eraser  from friends and family even coworkers  not sure what took me so long to try it out but when i did all i can say is wow  i had embedded stains from makeup and who knows what on the bathroom corian sink which i scrubbed with baking soda even softscrub with bleach and the stains didnt come all the way out  one try with the magic eraser and bam  stains gone  then i decided to try it on the black toaster oven where i accidentally left a loaf of bread and the plastic melted into the top  i washed it rubbed it and used everything i could think of but that thin layer of plastic wouldnt budge  in comes the magic eraser and it came off right away  no kidding  the name says it all because this stuff is truly magic
it did a nice enough job
i love this diaper print its so cute otb
i have to have electrolytes when playing tennis i play very competitively especially during the summer months when its very hot here in the deep south if i dont have an electrolyte drink available during a match i start getting the shakes and afterwards i am prone to muscle cramping which hurts like youknowwhat i have tasted these electrolyte drops and they taste fine in water but i havent been able to test it out on a hot court since its still winter but looking at the ingredients list it seems to have everything i need and more i especially like the extra potassium it contains  and i usually have to add a little nacl to it since i sweat so much of it out while playing but i probably wont have to because it contains 125mg of sodium per serving  im really looking forward to using this electrolyte come this spring and summer

i absolutely love love love this hat i was not sure if i would as i am generally not a hat person i have very fare skin however and wanted to see if a hat would work to protect me from the sun this year while working in the garden and this hat is going to be perfect and for an added bonus my hubby actually likes it on me i think it will also look super cute with a little sun dress to go out  i am only in my early 30s so its still fashionable not something for just your grandma but something you can add to your closet for summer days anywherei received the vefra summer large brim straw hat for women for free in order to conduct this review and provide my honest option of this item
this floss shredded in my husbands teeth and he was so disgusted he had to find glide floss just to get the strands of this floss out of his teeth disappointing

garcinia cambogia is a small sour tropical fruit used traditionally as a condiment and to prevent formation and increase release of intestinal gas  this herb used as natural appetite suppressant aids in weight management and does not taste bad  i mix it in with my yogurt and shakes  hopefully it will help me loose weight  ive taken for 2 days now 3 doses total and i already have more energy and notice a suppression in my appetite
i was not expecting the large size of this this will not fit most rolling papers only extra long ones i ended up purchasing a smaller 125 size that fits most papers the product was great quality just not what i was looking for make sure you are paying attention to the size it was delivered quickly and as listed
i ordered the dental duty teeth whitening kit with 14 nonslip whitestrips  whitening accelerator light for review  i have had the opportunity to review several other whitening kits recently and this one by far has given my wife the best results  she has completed six 20minute sessions and already has had significant results  her additional thoughts compared to whitening pens or other trays these are much easier to use  you simply open the strips place the larger strip on your top teeth and the smaller strip on your bottom teeth  be sure to get all the way down to your gums and press the strip to adhere closely to your teeth  then insert the light into the mouth tray and turn it on the light has an automatic shut off at 10 minutes  just turn it back on once or twice dependent on the time you want to continue whitening  i would not recommend nor does the instructions recommend any longer than a half hour you do need to open the battery compartment to remove the paper between the two batteries to use it the photos show her before pic along with after the first use and then after 6 uses  the pictures were taken in the same spot in the house at the same time of day without a flash because these are strips versus a gel you do not have anything draining into your mouth while you are whitening  once you turn off the light and remove the tray there is some saliva mixed with white foam  she did not gag as much as with the gels it may be too early to tell but at this point this product has not caused any additional sensitivity to her teeth this kit is less expensive then many other less comparable whitening kitsoverall my wife is happy with the results she has seen already  she is looking forward to finishing a complete week once she does i will update my review with new after pictures
okay the flavor on this one is intense  its strong enough that i find i dont want to chew it very long  to me thats much better than the usual weak flavor but is something to consider if you dont like a strong flavor  the flavor sticks around awhilethe packaging is recyclable i use them for storing small craft items in
i have seen others use these and they seem quite happy with them so i needed one because i am so uncomfortable on planes i am looking forward to using this when you take a plane for over just a few hours you really would like to sleep this should help me especially since it also has an eye mask and noise plugs
this is the second time i have bought bath booms the first time was lush which was great but expensive so i decided to try another one then i found ikalula i like ikalula bath booms they have sweety smells and different colors i love sweet orange most i love all orange and lemon smells they make my skin soft and make me relax after i bath i will buy it again

tried it on a window and a wreath and it is a yucky mess  never dried  stayed wet
i received this product and promptly put it in the refrigerator for twenty four hours or so i took one out noticing the easy open label on the top it actually was the plastic covering peels off with minimal effort and i think just about anyone will be able to twist the top off   unfortunately ive drank some bad things before ive even had spoiled beer that had unidentifiable chunks floating in it this was that bad it was revolting chalky and bitter with a horrible chemical sour twang i had two mouthfuls and i was still tasting this hours later yes i ate and drank other things to try and get rid of the taste but it lingered hands down this was the most revolting thing i have ever drank tossed the other five bottles in the trash i do not recommend this product unless you dont like someone a lot
use this product for long runs its great
brew it with hot water it helps with lung cleaning
ive enjoyed the premade version so reading the powdered version wasnt the same didnt surprise me but a lot of reviews claim it tastes terrible and was so different they threw it away luckily i trusted the company and tried this product anyway contrary to those lowstar reviews i disagree that it doesnt taste similar and when mixed in a blender you almost cant tell the difference i use a small portable version  just using a shaker cup doesnt blend it as successfully but ok if you just need that satisfying shake to stave off snack cravings i find this meal replacement to be very satisfying and helps stop me from craving excess food i do 2 scoops to actually replace a meal 1 scoop to stave off snacking note the container says 12 c is for 8oz  23 c 2 scoops is for 12 oz not as creamy as the premade but probably not as many additives either unfortunately ive realized this product causes stomach discomfort so i cant enjoy it as often as i would like if you pop and enzyme pill and a probiotic pill just before it helps a lot with the gas
a month ago my blood pressure was 14080 i had atrial flutter issues and my heart was acting bizarre i started taking a potassium and magnesium product and saw some results then i read the magnesium miracle by dr carolyn dean and stated taking this liquid magnesium i noticed good results with magnesium and now my blood pressure went down to 11060 so my nurse practitioner has halved my blood pressure medication and i have an appointment in a month to check it againif you do take this liquid magnesium and have high blood pressure make sure you are working with your doctor or nurse because your medication may need to be adjusted they also did an ekg on me and said my heart was normal and i told them well im taking magnesium they also did blood tests and said they were normal im not sure my nurse actually realized that the magnesium had lowered my blood pressure here are some of my experiences day by day at the startday 1 i took 14 teaspoon in 169 fluid ounces water it made me feel relaxed and i slept wellday 2 i got ambitious and took 12 teaspoon in a large container of iced tea and it only tasted a bit saltysipped over a couple of hours and it seemed to relax me and take the edge off my anxiety i thought it was giving me a lot of energy and made my heart beats really strongday 3 backed off a bit and took 14 teaspoon in a small amount of cranberry juice tasted salty and a bit bitter so didnt want to do that again decided it needed more liquid to make it palatableday 4 took 14 teaspoon in a pint 2 cups of coconut water my anxious thoughts stopped and my mind felt calm and almost as if my thoughts were not as loudday 5 took 14 teaspoon in 2 cups bottled water felt as if my system was detoxing and cleaning outday 6 felt like toxins were being released so drank more waterday 7 decided to try taking the magnesium liquid in capsules that way you cant taste and salty or bitter flavorday 8 while waiting to get capsules took 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in iced teaday 9 put 14 teaspoon magnesium in 3 veggie capsules swallowed them down with no issuessince then ive been taking 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in five veggie capsules i fill them up with a syringe and take them right away not letting them sit around to dissolve it is a little extra effort but it keeps my atrial flutter under control and i feel better in general you may want to wipe the capsules off a bit after filling i just use a napkin that way you dont taste any of the liquid that is my best solution and how im going to continue to take this magnesiummy cautions are to start slow with drops or 14 teaspoon and work up slowly to 12 teaspoon a day also read the magnesium miracle to understand all the reasons to take this product and how to take it i would not recommend taking it straight always dilute it in at least 2 or more cups of water to make it palatable i will say this magnesium does not have laxative effects like other magnesium products do that is a good thing if you want to leave the houseso my experience has been positive please consult with your doctor before taking any supplements as your medications may need to be adjustedthe rebecca review

looking through the clear bag when my kale powder arrived the shade of the green powder is a bit pale compared to the color of fresh kalebut curious to taste it i added a teaspoon of powder to a 12 glass of water and just drank itsurprisingly it tasted fresh and sweet  im just hoping this is truly what it says it ispure organic kale powder and nothing else  this tastes far better than so many green powders ive purchased  no bitterness whatsoever i feel this was a very good purchase  i bought the pound bagwhich will probably last a long time

this trimmer started out as a very nice trimmer  however after only a year the main trimmer head has broken rendering the unit mostly useless  while it worked great for the year i used it about once per month the trimmer head i use most of the time is broken and unusable  i find this to be very disappointing  the quality of this unit is very poor and one year of use for a unit of this costly makes me angry
very light and very short even with the telescopic handle

these are packaged up really cute thats pretty much where the positives end they smell rather gross and all smell basically the same if they get too wet they just disintegrate and disappear in seconds there is very little scent released in fact i couldnt smell them at all while in the shower after i got out i caught a whiff of very faint scent but thats it totally not worth it
these are the best shower scrubs ive ever used  i love them this is my second purchaseof these they are exfoliating but soft and they larger up very nicely without falling apart great deal
love it really helps with pain and strain
no more powerful than the battery version  if you are getting this because you love the battery powered one and want a little extra power dont waste your money  it is a wall plug in with a cord but it is an adapter and is really not better than the first one i got that uses batteries i sent it back  i do really like the battery version
the daily supplements are great to take and hard to miss theyre somewhat larger than normal and very condensed at that theyre easily the largest pill i have to take as a supplement that is not chewable
even nicer in person than the photos would definitely give as a gift super cute
this product is fine so long as its used properly obviously this is my fault for not being extra careful mixed up my regular solution with this bottle and lord well you can see what happened yes it says on the label not to put in eye like that but the packages i think needs to change as it looks to much like normal solution after research ive seen this has happened to others as well i just wanted to warn people about being extra extra careful

i am in my late 40s and cant see up close without my reading glasses i recently purchased a vanity mirror for my bathroom with 5x magnification i was horrified with what i saw the wrinkles didnt bother me  that goes along with age but i have lots of blackheads on my temples i couldnt see them before i have used the acne tools  the ones that look like dental tools and they work okay but those often leave behind temporary redness and you have to be precise about the location because of the small tips i found this ultrasonic cordless skin scrubber to be much more effective at getting rid of the blackheads and it doesnt leave behind any redness the end of it is about an inch and a half wide and it is able to scrape out the ugly blackheads you can see the dirt and grime on the tip after youve used it gross now as far as the scrubber goes it comes with a charger once it is on it has a vibration thing going on it heats up a little bit but not to the point where it is too hot to use or it burns i just can feel a little heat from it while it is in use theres a silicone cover to go over the metal end when it is not in use i am thrilled to have found thisi received this for free in exchange for my honest amp unbiased review my thoughts amp opinions are my own
good product
great taste and value i highly recommend these to keep whole familys immune system strong during these uncertain times
as advertised very useful
i really like magic eraser and it has helped make products come clean when before there was no hope since this product came out ive tried the 100 imitations that worked but crumbled in the process so i went back to the original and i am not too happy i used this to get scuff marks off my daughters sneakers and true thats a big task but it crumbled and much more elbow grease was needed than i remember i think that the ones with the blue scrubber side are better  ill try them next time
this stuff has a very strong fruity medicinal odor its not horrible but its so strong that a few squirts in the shower fills the whole house with the smell it seems to leave the shower glass clean and clear but ive used other daily products that worked better and didnt smell so much i wont be buying this again
this sandalwood oil smells wonderful i love it it is not overpoweringly strong but it is strong enough to be smelled across the room it also comes in a large leak proof glass bottle with a dropper included
tastes like battery acid and dried puke  just pay the extra money and get the capsulesim no ninny when it comes to choking down gross powders but glucosamine sulfate tastes like satan himself pissed in a pool of battery acid and drain cleaner then dried it out and sold it as a joint supplement
i absolutely love these masks the design and colors are attractive to me the material is thick and layered and they are comfortable to wear these are perfect for the fall or the winter they are made of 100 cotton and the current price of 1499 for these two masks are a reasonable price at 750 each
offering a 2 pack works well when there are multiple users in the household this product also states that it contains the mother which apparently is the more effective type of acv to take so far i have taken acv with as well as without and havent had any noticeable differences it has helped to regulate our digestive tract for both my husband and i but no weight loss benefits we are both mature seniors which i am sure makes a difference with weight loss benefits the taste is comparable slightly sweet with a mild acv hint the size is smaller than most the directions need clarity2 or 3
use this product to help with restless legs seems to work well and for the price its better than picking up at the grocery store
this blackhead remover vacuum is amazing it has an app that you can download to access the 20x magnifying camera so that you can see it actually helping your skin its kind of cool to actually watch the blackheads whiteheads and makeup particles being removed from your skin it has great suction power its easy to use and takes less than three minutes to finish your entire face its made well and is durable and seems to be long lasting this makes a great gift im very happy with this purchase great value

if you have small glasses like mine it can be hard to find clipon sunglasses these work perfectly you might need to bend the outer clips to get them to fit over thick lenses but thats no big deal note that the sunglass coating does scratch relatively easy so keep them protected when not in use

for a basic eye mask of this style it is attractive budget friendly and are well made blocks out light via not only the outer material but also an internal piece of flannel stitched in im not sure why it has a pocket nothing to come out perhaps to add your own additional padding or black out material no ideanot adjustable but there is a lot of stretch how loose or tight this fits depends on your head i think it would be easy enough to make an adjustment to smaller size with a couple of quick stitches and i am not one to sew  i like that it isnt adjustable because usually the adjustable part snags my hair or i can feel it against my headhowever it being a little large to start is good because i have a large head my head measures 2375 this fits me without feeling too snug most feel way too snug but at some point in night i didnt like the feel not sure why yetmaterial is nice stitching is good comfortable when first on over course of night i could feel some pressure i eventually took it off i think these will be used for the occasional nap or when i need to just rest my eyes for me i think the pressure is due to the use of slim elastic and the opening to that pocket area i can just feel it at some point most all eye masks use slim elastic and what it does for me is create pressure across eye area where it pulls on the material through there but since this isnt too snug feeling i think it has more to do with that crease where the pocket it more material to smash against my faceso initially comfortable but then turns uncomfortable your experience may varyquality overall seems fine love the 3 pack love the floral design of the ones i selected it just isnt quite for me sadly ill try it a few more times if i experience anything else i will let you know in the mean time these are just ok hence 3 starsoddly my favorite sleep mask is one that no one else seems to like lol i keep waiting for it to come back so i can buy another or maybe i will figure out a way to make one for myself i am linking it in case you too have a big head and are bothered by the pressure of the slim elastic or at very least can see what i mean by largewide elastichttpswwwamazoncomdpb07rjqgv61
they look nice but they are hard to put on and they dont stay up too tight for me i prefer the 1020 mmhg
full disclosure i totally thought this was a joke i saw the image in the description of the ironic hipster holding a green smoothie and thought this was a 34soylent green34 type gag gift for your literary friends who like a dark joke turns out this is actually a legit meal replacement powder boy i feel silly having a giant tub of neutral flavored slim fast sitting on the counter forever now
nice plates  napkins for a birthday celebration
these are fantastic
its essentially a velcrostrap waistband with a gel pack inside for heat or cold therapy i ordered this to replace an old one i had that was no longer usable this wrap is a quality product and comes with a gel pack that is much larger than the old one i was using which is great you can also place smaller gel packs in the pocket if you wish but so far ive found the larger gel pack that comes with it to be preferable works great for lower back pain gives relief in just a few minutes easy to put on and remove as well there are lots of these for sale here but this one is exceptionally good in my opinion
nice lemony smell and taste if any easy to take
this is a great case for purse or briefcase comes in handy on a belt for outdoor hikeswould recommend for sure
keeps everything organized and reminds me to take my pills
wasnt exactly what i was looking for
if youre not comfortable using gloves when handling clay and other artists materials these are great made of silicone this set comes in 3 sizes the small fits my pinky the medium fits my index finger and the large is for my thumb they have little dot nubs on them but you can turn them inside out for a completely smooth surface reusable washable so its eco friendly comes in 4 sets of small medium and large 12 total
vegetable glycerin  or glycerol  is a clear odorless liquid that has a sweet taste the liquid is produced from plants usually  palm oil  coconut oil or soy it has many uses cosmetics shampoo conditioner toothpaste i use it in my  vapor juice or ejuice in ecigs it is generally referred to as vg it produces more vapor than propylene glycol another component in ecigs i find the 99 pure kosher vg is an outstanding product with an excellent price i also use vegetable glycerin with essential oils and i make moisturizers and hair conditioners with it it needs to be stores away from sunlight and has a shelf life between 12  18 months  shelf life does vary
i like it only support you can truly boost back up when it lessens to resupport you hand pump worked for about a yr and a half and then went but i like it
like but dont love wiggles around too much and causes fatigue in sensitive areas use for no more than 4 hours a day
this cordless auto curler is horrible it did not have instructions for how to put my hair into the curler so i watched a video of a similar curler i put a small piece of my freshly washed combed hair over the section to curl my hair i pushed the button to curl my hair the section that rotates in the middle grabbed my hair but not all of it at once my hair got caught in the curler and i had to pull it to get my hair out it damaged my hairthe box comes with a curler a base and a power cord it has vague instructions when it comes to actually put your hair into the curler it does have instructions on the different settingsi will not be recommending this cordless auto curler to family friends or even enemies
bought it for my son and he didnt want to tell me that there was something wrong with the charging cord or battery  i still havent heard back from the seller
i have been able to reuse them it is a tight squeeze putting them back togetherbe careful they do not fit all bottle inserts
works like a charm on my beret
this filter is working fairly well in our shower  hubs isnt tall so it didnt affect him but i am tall and it comes to just a an inch or so above my head  i can still take a shower but the shower spray is not as diffuse as before  installing the filter was basically a nobrainer  take off shower head install filter apparatus even plumbing tape is included put shower head back on  we dont have a hard water problem here but i like knowing a lot of chemicals are being filtered out  i dont know how long these filters will last but i will be ordering more just to have on hand
the perfect item for my emergency supply kit  it fits perfect and built solid  i filled a 5 gallon bucket with my emergency supply kit and snapped this on for the lid  im getting another for my rare camping trips  no more squatting in the bushes
i am happy with the way this clipper cuts and the feature to be able to store clippings and emptyhoweveri thought that i was getting two different size clippers one for finger nails and one for toe nails that would be a larger size butthey are both the same sizei havent tried yet to see if they can cut toe nails easily or notthere werent any directions on how to empty but i figured it out just pull off the purple plastic coveringeasy
this product is great but i was a little upset that the batteries do not work continuouslyalmost like there is a short in the battery compartment
color is good  stays secure in pocket  thats all that matters
i would give this less stars if i could stay far far away
too bulky to be woren as a necklace i thought the stones were going to be small and suitable to be worn on the neck they are too heavy on the neck btw i am 6ft tall and muscular
there are 20 gallonsized plastic storage bags in this box and each has a slider closure the cowboys emblem takes up the entire front side of the bag as can be seen in the attached picturewhat i like about these is that they expand at the bottom in the picture the bag contains two 1763 ounce containers of marcona almonds and i had room to spare  the expandable bottom ensured that these stand up on their own  overall i really like these they do feel a bit thinner than other ziploc bags but not so thin that it matters muchthese are great for storing nuts cheese crayons a wet bathing suit and anything else that can fit into a onegallon bag at the current price of 999 this comes to 50 cents per bag
these were terrible neither my husband or myself could wear them they were so uncomfortable  could not be adjusted in any way to be comfortable
fantastic just what i needed thank you
our goto balm for most things baby bums scratches cuts chapped lips and hands so many uses
if your mask hurts your ears or is too tight this is for you it is an earsaver package of silicone extenders and ear savers i like that they are adjustable for those of us with really long hair it is nice to put the strap along the back of our neck
id give 5 stars but this does not moisturize very well need to reapply often ive been looking for a good vegan lip balm that works as well as burts bees but this isnt it unfortunately
easy to use gloves and helpful with washing dishes i was concerned about the size as i have small hands and these are one size but the kinda hug your hand even if they are bigger then id need they stay on well
they work great i had trouble before i ordered these strips my mask would not stay n my head i ordered these connecting strips and im very happy
i have used milk thistle in a capsule form in a tea form and in a glycerite but never in powdered form  i mixed some into some warm soup and in a smoothie and found it a great way to use it  i know it discusses baking with it but im pretty sure at those temperatures you would be compromising all of the antioxidants they take such care in preserving so i dont recommend it  i liked that it was organic gmo free and packaged well in a resealable bag  i felt it was a good value for the amount of the product you get in the bag
they arent terrible with such a small amount i can gulp it down quickly i actually had to go to look up what predigested hydrolyzed protein was it is protein that has been reduced to the amino level at that level it is considered predigested and more easily absorbed
it works ok  nothing replaces goddards it was uniquely effective
i really like these but i took off one star because they are very heavy
i do well in it did work pretty well not sure if ill buy again
these fg clean wipes are great for cleaning so many things and have so many other uses as well they clean very well without harsh chemicals and without leaving any lint behind they dont tear apart like paper towels they are more like thin indestructible fiber clothsive kept one in my oil box and have been using it for several days to clean my essential oil diffusers just washing them with soap and water doesnt get all of the residual oils out but these cloths do im sure that one cloth will last for quite a while im also keeping one on my nail table to wipe my brushes clean when using poly gels and other liquids if i get anything on it i can shake it off in the trash and put it in my led lamp so the polish or polygel can cure and i can continue using it as long as possible ive taped one to the inside of my new led nail lamp so that the bottom of it doesnt get dirty with polish or other nail enhancement liquids or gels ive used a couple of them to do a quick clean of my refrigerator inside and outi know im missing some things but theyre just so many uses for them these are wonderful cloths and i absolutely recommend them
i normally wouldnt rate tissue but these are fabulous  shouldve gotten earlier in the year  these are so soft and heavy wmoisturizing  soon as you touch one you will feel the difference seriously  absorbent and can also use to take off makeupespecially that old mascara under yr eyes   these come in cube boxes which are better suited to my house and how many ppl need a box in their rms  getting 1 big box at a time is a time  my energy saver too in the long run  could of used these for our summerfall allergies poor noses
the only bag out of the three that has any major decoration is the red one in the center which has the more 343d34 stockings the other two are simple and have no 34pop out34 decorating they are simple and boring and would cost 2 at any store this is not worth the 12 i paid
i bought these for a home office because i could not see the yellow highlighter on my paperwork under the light from warm cfls  definitely a much whiter light than you might be used to the gas station minimart look that another reviewer mentioned but you can get excellent results if you put one of these and one warm cfl in a 2bulb fixture theyre the same size as a generic 100w light bulb so they fit any fixture but note that they are a bit slower than most cfls to come up to full brightness maybe 30 seconds or sobeware the miserable factory packaging a tightfitting cardboard box with zero padding  i ordered a 2pack which arrived with one bulb broken amazon took them back and sent a replacement and again one bulb arrived broken  im going to get a third package but this time ill hold on to the one good bulb so i can send back two broken ones assuming they dont send me two broken bulbs which is a distinct possibility  this is despite plenty of airbag packaging from amazon  i suspect theyre being busted further up the supply chaincompared to costcos 8pack prices on warm cfls these are relatively expensive but with 50 losses in shipment i suppose they have to charge twice as much
i did not like the feeling of these straws on my tongue theyre not perfectly smooth im not going to use these straws
absolutely love this was a bit hesitant about it using the cordless feature but it held a strong charge for the entire process of grooming my extremely fluffy dog love that it came with different clipper  settings  nail clipper and file comb and sharp scissors be aware it does not have the outlet adapter but u can plug as its a usb charger and i just used my iphone plug to charge it  its also not too loud and my dog remained calm during the process
ok so i have to say that my intended use is not what these are marketed for but the are still exactly what i needed i have some smaller fish tanks in my home and have had great difficulty in finding good cleaners for the sides of the tanks that are small enough and will not scratch these work wonderfully for the purpose the sticks are plastic not paper so they do not disintegrate and are reusable if cleaned appropriately very pleased
i live near a train yardi like having a nice background noise to sleep bythe sounds are nice but i dont use all of themi picked a favorite and that works for mea few of the sounds are a little to crisp and would be better if muffled or if the unit was at a distance perhaps in the hallway
no support at all better off getting the whole foot support
ill date myself here i have been a packers fan since vince lombardi days  lol you you can surmise i was thrilled that ziploc has packers storage bags  easy choice to make
so far so good  my husband who does smoke has had a lot of congestion since getting over a cold a couple months ago  when i was looking for an nac product this one had excellent reviews  i bought some for him a couple years ago but he complained it made him cough too much  so this time i went with 600mg  he took them twice a day with a meal to avoid stomach upset no problems there taking one at dinner time did cause him to cough a lot at nighttime thus affecting his sleep which then turned him into a bear  so he only takes one a day with his lunch and actually takes it without griping  so far he has been able to breathe much better and producing a lot more phlegm i know i know that it would be far better to just quit smoking maybe someday also these pills have no odor but for now this product is working to help him and would definitely recommend  one disappointment though was i had received a promotion from the company when i received the product for a 25 amazon gift card to apply for after using for a week  i was to go to their website and give my review to receive it  their website doesnt exist  that was a bummer  but overall happy with the results of this product so far
works great holds well
slides around too much on the bottom of my foot
i use it in the shower and like it a lot  my husband is letting me use it for awhile to see if it holds up  if it does he will get his own  update  i purchased another and both died before a year  just stopped working without any warning at all  when it worked they worked great but they die early  disappointed
there are three rollon fragrances in this set of real love citrus glow and frankincense i love the citrus glow as it has a fullbodied orange aroma the frankincense is my next favorite followed by real love which is my least favorite i cannot describe the scents of the other twoi applied each to the inside of my wrists unfortunately the fragrance does not last long at all about one hour the current price of 2499 would be competitive if these lasted longer and if i liked all three scents the citrus one is my only favorite
i got this set about a week ago and my kids eyes lit up when they saw them  the enjoy playing with them a lot  spikes on the balls are not sharp but give good sensory feeling  the ball is light squishy and bouncy and the rings are more heavy sturdy built but still have some flexibility to it  i kept one set for myself to keep at my work desk to squish  smash when im thinking or dealing with some stress  my box came with the 3 balls and 3 rings all in the same 3 colors green pink and blue  the box does show orange and yellow options so not sure if those are random or what but what i got matches the pics in the listing  when i first opened the new plastic smell was strong but a week later the smell has faded away and not a problem  overall good quality and very useful  i can see these being used and lasting a long time
you have to read the ingredients i have been drinking this tea for three days it has little if any  taste  in respiratory distress because i am allergic to oranges i have hives in my throat chokingfrom now on i will read the ingredients
i ordered this on a thursday afternoon and it was delivered about 18 hours later  however i couldnt keep this on because my arm would sweat and the band slipped off  i found it uncomfortable the velcro rubbed against my upper arm whenever i bent my arm  i am really surprised that no one has mentioned the sweating  the inside of the strap is rubber  i will be sending this back for a refund
heps to distribute weight to take pressure off sciatica comes with nice cover
arrived on time and in good condition  this works great for cleaning oil and grim off your hands  i would recommend for shops  cheaper than other brands and work better
love the aria it was easy setup and works great
very good product
i got these specifically to clean the interior of my car such as the door panels and center console i didnt realize how dirty they were until i used these
this box is gorgeous and elegant and has diamond like etchings on it it is also as sturdy as those colorful square boxes one can buy at home goods the front flap magnetically closes since it is a beautiful silver no wrapping is necessary the only problem i have is that it comes with a bow that looks like it has been run over by a truck with black marks across it  in many places see photosto set this box up all i had to do was unfold it it is one piece and unfolds into the shape shown in less than a couple of seconds there are no ugly creases just a beautiful and sturdy box that can be used repeatedly for storage or for gifting this particular version is the size of a small shoebox and will hold some lingerie or a small pair of pjs the current price of 999 1199 plus 2 off is competitive however until they fix the problem with the supplied ribbon i recommend passing on this
good file much better than most others
used for foot stability
love my go to gentle but cleans
not heavy works great wonderful price
this brace is comfortable and it fits into my lace up tennis shoes or work shoes it stabilizes the ankle and lifts the toe which prevents fallsi have ordered 3 braces and this is the besti gave a 4 star rating only because the strap from the toe to the ankle was not holding after 5 weeks or sothe company is sending me a replacement at no charge great customer serviceupdate i changed my review to a 5 star because the company sent a new brace not just the strapexcellent customer service
loved the napkins
this product is a life saver for my dad no spills and no more risk of falling in the middle of the night when he wakes up to urinate
very high quality light i use it at my main sewing machine makes a big difference will definitely be ordering more to put at my other machines
great replacement heads and great price
yes you can buy peroxide for less money but this is mixed to a 3 strength and has a nice scent to it so it saves a lot of time and effort  does the job good disinfectant  unless you want to fool around with mixing your own id say just bite the bullet on this one
when my generic ambien doesnt work i get out of bed and take these pills then im able to get to sleep in the next fifteen to thirty minutes some nights i just take this along with my sleeping pills to give me a deeper sleep when taking these natural sleep pills i find that i sleep through the night better no waking up at odd hours of the night i also notice im less anxious about sleeping when i take two pills you are not supposed to take more than two these do contain maltodextrin if that concerns you the herbsplants in this formula include lemon balm and passionflowerthe rebecca reviewi received one free bottle for review purposes this review is my honest opinion
i love this previously i was using s tennis ball this is a lot easier id pay more for slightly higher qualify however it still works well
i put this on my sofa i ran out halfway through because you need to apply two coats the liquid is white and the bottle is white so i didnt realize it was almost empty at a glance it looked like the bottle was still full then i realized it was opaque a lot more must come out with the sprayer than i realizedhonestly i have not noticed much dirt and waterrepelling qualities i still have to use my bissel green machine to clean up spills it helps the liquid pool up without totally soaking into the upholstery but its not 100 waterproof however in exchange for that its not stiff like scotchguard or anything with the small quantity i would use it on something like dining room chairs it took too much product to cover an entire sectionali wouldnt view this as a stain prevention method but rather something that buys you time to clean it up with a stronger product
solid cool looking trimmer  comes with 3 clip on bladecomb adjustments  rechargeable lion battery it lasts for 23 hours lit indicator  single button strong cutting  trim the sideburns trim the beard eyebrows and cut designs in your hair if you want  nice gift for the guys
obviously they arent named brand heads they are generic brand from another country they are much softer and im not sure how long they will last  doubt i will buy again they did fit my clarsonic mia just fine though so no issue there
it works but i would buy it again
first  these contain soy which means i cannot touch them because im allergic to soy the other folks on our hiking trip all tried them instead why is soy required3 out 3 hated the chocolate crisp cereal bars all agreed they smell ok but taste awful theres a bit of a bitter aftertaste and a distinctly chemical type flavor to the sweetness it wasnt like a diet cola nasty but bad enough that none of the 3 would eat more than a couple of bites one time i cant give the remaining bars away
coverage is good
i really like this organic kale powder it has a subtle taste in my organic protein shakes i use it every morning along with frozen mixed berries or frozen tropical fruit i put the powder into a mason jar that makes it easier to get into without getting it all over my hand
works well on curling short hair
i discovered this at my local gymspa i love it just wish it was not sooooooo expensive  i dont understand why it is so expensive its only coconut extract id love to find something less expensiveanyone know of something similar
i take a liquid vitamin but this product made me very ill i took it with a meal and about 5 min after ingestion i became sweaty and vomited i took it 3 other different times per instructions and each time i became violently ill throwing up does youngevity have a money back guarantee
can i go lower than one star  i found these bars completely inedible and the taste vile usually when i dont like something i put it out for the various critters in our area i threw these away as i didnt want to be accused of cruelty to animals yuck
i like it one tip though  cleaning your face is not to be underestimated i broke out after using this and it was not the fault of the product rather i brought up a lot of bacteria and spread it all around my face
functions well well made good price and you get two sets
these comfortable gloves are perfect for doing dishes so your hands dont get wet with the nasty water they are comfortable durable and they look nice theyre also easy to cleanthis pack contains two of the regular gloves and two with the soft fuzzy lining
these didnt stick at all they slid down into my shoes
when you have to work from home you need to make your chair more supportive and comfortable this goes a long way to helpin
i really love the light clean smell of this cleaner
its kinda pricey but fun for tracking your weight progress currently bummed because the instructions advise that you not use this while pregnant  definitely something to keep in mind other than that it has a nice look and is super convenient for tracking weight alongside your fitbit
blows every other foot file out of the water
great quality product
keeps my house smelling wonderful lasts a long while
these adhere really well and stay put  i will definitely buy again
not good for thick hair takes a long time doing small sections at a time however curls come out very nice if you have the time
holds both of my epipens  seems pretty sturdy  i added a carabiner so i could attach it to my backpack  i like that the color stands outedit ive had my original for 6 years now and its just now starting to show wear  its held up really well  im ordering a new one to replace it and hopefully it lasts just as long  very happy with this product
works  good value for the price
taking trim probiotic for women has definitely made me feel better overall ive taken probiotics for quite a while now and i always look for ones with a high cfu 25 billion is a great number i dont think theyve made me any trimmer but i think ive had less bloating overall the serving size is one pill per day easy peasy 50 for a months supply isnt the most affordable in my opinion but i do think this is a good product
as someone that takes a lot of supplements  i was interested in adding artichoke to help with lowering cholesterol and calming a sensitive digestive systemadding artichoke is kind of a no brainer since most people tolerate it very well side effects are rare and often more of a coincidence unrelated to taking this supplementi also take tart cherry and licorice as well as a turmericginger comboepisodes of gerd are less and less fingers crossed for my next blood work
pretty good
this is a great quality probiotic strain that really can help with so many issues for me it helps with autoimmune inflammatory issues so much im really happy with how well these work
was so uncomfortable i sent it back
thought they were going to be pure  copper package states they are stainless steel
not sure why this product was even invented when any soap and water will do the same thing  i washed a green acrylic paint stained acrylicbristle brush in this and it did not get rid of very much of the green paint  i went back to my regular hand soap and hot water to get rid of most of the rest of the paint  too bad its less messy than my method but not as functional
i have been using this product for years and it surely does what it says it does i use this item daily as i have sore gums  wear dentures  i must say that benzodent does the trick
i wanted to buy a good pair of ear plugs for attending concerts and live shows which i do frequently i was torn between these and the etymotic research er20smc plugs so i ordered both they are very similar especially in terms of sound quality most wont notice a difference although i do believe i prefer the downbeats soundwisebut the dbs are far more comfortable in the ear i recently went on a trip and couldnt find my dbs so i took the etys and also realized that they are even more uncomfortable when laying unless you sleep on your back i prefer the case on the etys as it opens and closes quietly but performance and comfort are the most important qualities in ear plugs my friend also tried both and prefers the etys but only because he fears the short downbeats will get stuck somehow ha
decent boost great flavor unusual in most preworkouts will buy again
so this smells like watermelon and it smells wonderful a little goes a long way because it is a little strong but it smells delicious
they do not fizz at all not a good scent either
when i read mini dustpan i thought this one would be a little bit smaller than it is it is pretty small but i was hoping a little smaller i do like it though and it is very versatile the pan makes collecting the dirt easy the brush has a brush side on one end and a squeegee side on another this is perfect for making sure you get all the dirti like that the brush neatly stores within the pan in addition they give you a small little brush that works very well in cleaning out dirt from your keyboard or other small areas i actually use this for cleaning out the cage of my flying squirrels it makes a job that usually takes me closer to 5 to 10 minutes a 1 minute taskthe materials are also perfect that if they ever get dirty you can just clean it easily with soap and water
this is actually really easy to use the pictures are from our first attempt with a small watermelon the slices were nowhere near perfect but still it was easier than using a knife the rubber grip helps a lot if you get juice on your hands and the whole thing feels solid the melon baller was ok but would actually work better on a cantaloupe or something firmer since its a bit on the small sidei received this in return for a review its doubtful you will get picture perfect results without a lot of practice but it does make it better and easier
purchased these for my 92 yr old dad his room is tiled and these keep his feet warm and allow him to make trips to the bathroom without having to make the effort to put on slippers these are not carried in walk in stores and so thank you amazon for carrying these ive purchased over 1 doz pairs in the last few years
like this product though i had to do a trial and error to figure out the different settings  i also found out what a mask is in japan and ordered some face masks online as the result though dont use the massager with them  certainly less expensive than a few of the other options out there  the english translation in the booklet could be a little clearer
they break easily i keep getting packs that have bulbs with exposed wires and detached bases other than that they work really well perfect daylight balanced bulbs very bright i replaced my entire house with these bulbs and surprisingly my utilities bill decreased
i ordered these because they were clear not knowing they had no screw on caps  the lid is the cap and has a rubber seal so they do not leak  its just so nice not having 3 pieces floating around while they are drying in my bathroom
very firmsmooth good quality  i use as an exercise for balance  its supposed to strengthen leg muscles
has helped my husbands stomach
this lash curler has  teeth  along the silicon they seem to help with after mascara lashes it separates them and gives a more natural look really affordable and does the work comes with multiple replacement which is appreciated
i love this combination of kelp and potassium  i was feeling tired most of the time and after only using it for 2 days i can feel an increase in my energy level  excellent if you use sea salt or a salt with no iodine to replenish the iodine your body needs
little pricy but gives me the opportunity to salute the queen of bengazi every day thanks
the problem is that they wear out in just a week or so
i have been taking magnesium for several years to help ward off leg cramps  this formula is the best i have found
elevated toilets are very expensive and hard to find this innovative product solved my problem and you cannot even notice its there my handyman installed it in 30 minutes and i am much the better for it as the old hips aint what they used to be
a friend recommended this product for bruises it works i sprayed the bruised area and rubbed it in then sprayed a bandage and placed it on my arm overnight i did that 3 nights in a row and the bruising was gone my bruises usually take over 2 weeks to finally fade away this stuff really does the trick im thrilled cuz i hate those old lady bruises they look awful now when i bang my arm or hand ill just use this stuff highly recommend
this will definitely cover both upper and bottom denturel but the container is not leak proof its to be used at home and not for storing dentures while traveling unless stationary
no vitamins what so ever  must of read somewhere that it was the best bang for your buck though
we had rust stains on our countertop from our metal paper towel holder they are gone it took 5 minutes for the pink stuff to do its job wow never thought the stains would go away and they disappeared easily thank you for this amazing product i wish id taken a before pic
not worth anything kinda keeps it cleaner but barely plus makes it even harsher after a few bowls
but did not fit my eyelash curler i didnt realize they werent all the same size
work perfectly in my sally hansen curler the feel isnt as nice as the original that came with the curler but i received a whole bunch of them for less than the curler which is how it should be the ones i received were very colorful pink blue greenno black but i dont really care as long as they fit
very good for muscle relief of neck back arms and legs
all of these socalled healing tools with heating elements seem to emit extremely high emfs im a supersensitive and this thing set me off asap there is an awful odor that smells like burning wires that i could detect after a minute or so of heating the pad was getting hot but i was feeling nauseated being near it so i pulled out the emf meter both settings one for electric and the other for magnetic both fields were almost maxed out at various places on the pad i feel scrambled just having done this experiment and had it on for less than 3 minutes do not recommend that this would assist human health i think the negatives outweigh the benefits as far as ive seen only medicrystal has a method to contain the dirty emfs and have a truly healing heating pad with crystals and this looks like a direct ripoff of their designs
as expected they perform well i have no complaints they do say to sterilize before use i got my normal span of use with them before needing a change will repurchase
i love this long wearing lip color this shade is a somewhat lightmedium pinkmauve shade but is not too light for my fair skin i have difficulty finding cooltoned lipstick that is not too bright  finding pinks  mauves that do not look rosy or peach on me this is perfect with my fair pink skin with blue undertones if i want a slightly darker shade i mix it with another color
these are almost perfect  ive recently painted several rooms cabinets  shelving  i dont like having to go to the garage and haul in a big heavy gallon of paint for a minor touch up  i filled the tubes using the pumps which was easy  quick  i used them once wiped off the felt applicator  stored them in the hall closet  i got them out again last week for more touch ups and 2 of the felt applicator tips came off  i wasnt surprised as i read some previous reviewers had the same problem  this really isnt a huge concern for me as from now on i will just keep a few of the cheap foam brushes next to the tubes  i consider it a very minor inconvenience  well worth it to not have to go back to my old way of doing touch ups  i will be buying another set
while this is a good chair for watching tv it is not very comfortable for longer use  it is easy to assemble but not a good purchase for the price
nice looking and very good quality
over the past eight months ive tried a few different neck traction pillows ive found they are all quite similar and accomplish the same goal with only slight variations in design this one like most others is made of a hard foam with just the slightest bit of give when you rest your head on it its possible to use the pillow in either direction one way providing a more gentle stretch the other a more intense stretch this pillow does not have the bumps and nodes that some others have which are supposed to provide some acupressure and massage to your neck though i cant say that they make much of a difference for me this pillow does however have a softer cushion in the center that makes it a little more comfortable on the back of my head its a very nice featureif youre new to this type of device go slow when i first used one of these pillows i could only lie on it for a few minutes at a time but have worked my way up to 1015 minutes twice a day i also recommend starting with the side that gives you the more gentle stretch for me using a device like this has provided quite a lot of relief to my neck and shoulders that tend to carry a lot of tension since i sit at a computer all dayif youre looking for an alternative to medication for some relief for back and neck pain this is definitely worth a try
let me start off by saying im from philly home of the superbowl champs the eagles   dallas is not very welcome around here however i do like to jab my husband every now and then  i will be using these for tailgating  we have season tickets so i will be taking these to a few games just to freak people out  i used one to hold some cut up watermelon and take it to work for a few coworkers  it zipped and unzipped fine  it didnt leak and didnt stretch  when i unpacked it at lunch there wasnt even a drip that came out of it  for me thats important  i take fruit to work every day and also pack fruit for my whole family i use smaller bags for them but i was treating some coworkers so i needed a large bag like this  i used a bag to store some soft pretzels and put them in the freezer  you really cant go wrong with ziploc  the only thing different is the logo on the bag  its really a beautiful star dallas cowboys star if you are a dallas fan or know one this would be a great gift for them  what i like about ziploc bags is the zipper  i have had others that the zipper gets stuck and i land up breaking it and the bag is useless  i used 4 of these bags and the zipper was easy open and easy close and strong  i have broken zippers by tugging too hard also  these are great bags  this is my normal brand that i buy and have always bought without the dallas star lol
this is just plain great stuff my hair nails and overall improvement in health can attest to that it tastes great and given enough time to dissolve into whatever you are putting it in is nearly clear it takes longer to dissolve in cold beverages than hot and if you dont mix it thoroughly enough itll get glumpy and stick to the spoon until it dissolves patience its worth it i highly recommend this product and have already made numerous orders we even sprinkle it on the pet food for the cats and the piggy
these work great for both reading and watching tv while lying flat they are sturdy and comfortable and make a great gift that is actually useful
bought to clean the bottoms of my pool works great
great nail dryer
this diaper is very soft and well made the velcro holds up thru washing and stays in place its 100 cotton and perfect for a short diaper free time to relieve a red bottom however it leaked through after baby peed once so its for extremely short use i hope they make more absorbent ones because it is really soft and easy to put on and take off
i grew up using hot water bottles when i had stomach aches or back aches its been harder to find hot water bottles though this bottle is the same as id used for years it is easy to fill up and comes with an additional cover to prevent people from touching the bottle when it is too hot  while many people dont use these hot water bottles once youve used it when youre feeling poorly youll see how helpful and comforting they are  i rely on them when im feeling poorly and waiting for medicine or my cure to kick in
helps with a bed ridden person and you can warm them in the microwave  they are also thick and cushioned
beautiful and fun balloons but this should not be called a kit its balloons no strings and no sticks i had to go out at the last minute to purchase the string
this does work fairly well and after a bit of fiddling my problem not the curlers i got it working well its still an extra step i dont always do just because of the extra time  getting set up using it and putting it away  but when i want to go all out this does a great job its easy to use and does work
wife and daughter use and are pleased what else can you ask for
in the bathtub this product works great it is much easier to use than the typical baby baths and can easily be used for an infant in the reclining position or an older baby in the supported sitting position  i love the fact that this takes up less room and makes it much easier to wash the baby directly in the bathtub the bottom seat part has rubber grips to prevent any sliding and the pillow portion floats nicelymy issue with this product is the fact that it holds a ton of water actually absorbs the water and then takes over 24 hours to dry i dont know why it wasnt made to be waterproof considering its used in a bathtub  that said it is still a great alternative to the traditional baby bath it takes up less space and allows the baby more freedom to move around during bath time
these are nice but i feel they are over priced
while i love the convenience it is a lot cheaper to make this yourself the lime seems the most popular and it happens to be the easiest to make you can buy redmonds real salt use the fine ground popcorn variety as your sodium add some calm for magnesium and you can get potassium powder quite cheap you can get true lime powder for the lime flavoring and use a packet of steviaerythritol for the sweetener  voila if you want the raspberry just get some freeze dried raspberries and crush them into a powder and add a little
perfect  i bought this for my daughters dorm room  she loves it
i have a 2 and 4 year old im a nurse and i love microbiology so i have studied which bacterias are commonly in the body and which we need this probiotic is very complete and my kids are always very excited to eat one every night theyre chewable and have a good taste i tried one myself beforehand i have had issues with others i have trued because they refuse to take them so its a huge pluseveryone should take daily probiotics so overall i am very impressed and will keep purchasing them definitely recommend
easy to use
none of them were bent and its still hanging ill be able to reuse
great product my family and i noticed less gas and bloating in just a couple of days after taking prebiotic
i am surprised that this is still available  not a surprise that is comes from england  sometimes i want to clear my passages without the use of drying medications  this temporarily clears nasal passages
it was difficult to know if i was getting the right filter when ordering the one i ordered did not match the one i took out of my filter housing but the new one is 10 stage and it did fit i hate changing the filter the company really needs to come up with a better design for ease of changing the filter
great product  price and fast delivery
the wife made me do it
although normally associated with mens health issues especially those prostate related pumpkin seed oil is a great supplement for both sexes in addition to supporting the bladder and urinary tract it is heart protective it has powerful antiinflammatory properties and is frequently used as an antiparasitic it helps with insomnia and depressionthese capsules by natures bounty are fairly large but i had no difficulty swallowing them and experienced no unpleasant side effects they are somewhat diuretic but i find that they do help me get a good nights sleep my mother has sever arthritis and reported these eased her pain and stiffness i take these as a preventative and am satisfied with this product
these are great glasses to stash around the house because almost everyone can wear them and 150 can help almost everyone but are not too strong its fun to have three different color frames in colorcoordinated snug fitting protective cases the frames are lightweight and comfortable i dont expect them to survive being sat upon for instance the plastic feels like it would snap but they seem like they are durable i find that they are best for reading a book or a computer where you are not moving your head very much because the focal point is fairly specific once you turn your head a little bit the focal point changes more expensive glasses dont seem to do this all in all they are great for an emergency or  for instance  in the bathroom in case you need to read some fine print on a medication bottle etc
my wife love it well built and less cost great for travel and daily use
very nice product works great made very sturdygreat price would recommend this product to any one looking for a foot spa
this horsetail extract is potent i didnt realize thats it would give me energy and it help relieve some joint and muscle pain within the hour when i take it i mix 18 tsp of it in the morning and another 18 tsp at night be careful with this stuff its potent on my first dose of this i tested with 14 tsp and i was bouncing off the wallsi mix this with the following powders nettle root extract curcumin extract ginger root extract boswellia quercitin extract acerola cherry ashwagandha extract and reishi extract which act like a natural antiinflammatory and pain tonicim also taking this horsetail to help build strong bones due to the high silica content horsetail is a great supplement for strong bones and teeth since silica is what gets converted to calcium in the body so this way i allow my body to produce natural calcium it needs to build bonei will be buying more when i run out and look forward to the long term benefits of horsetail
i love these  after wearing dollar store readers for the last 4 years i decided i really needed something i didnt have to take on and take off at church and at class  these are perfect  clear vision in both the plain glass and in the readers i ordered in 200style and classyor so my grandchildren tell me
these earring hooks are super comfy they look fantastic and sophisticated unlike some of the other products it comes with all the essential wire colors highly recommend
handy to have the week ready to go or just grab out the day  the outer case provides additional assurance the meds stay in place while packed
price gouge much
for the price these will work
nice product to have to accommodate bedside commode
these are so convenient and work great
seems to be a good ip6
i have already after 4 days use noticed an improvement in the pain in my thigh
i started taking this supplement about 2 weeks ago  i have rheumatoid arthritis as well as osteoarthritis in both knees  recently i have developed tendonitis in both shoulders so i thought id try thisit gave me the absolute worst heartburn ever  i try to stay away from heartburn medications but pepcid is my 34go to34 for occasional hb relief but even this would not relieve iti will not buy again nor would i recommend it to anyone
duplicate needed in two rooms kids fight over stars no more  thank you for posting sale
one of the two pill organizers is small and the other is large i ordered two of the large ones but received two different sizes annoying last time i ordered two and got two of the same sizeotherwise these gsk pill dispensers are nice  better than the cheap cvs version although the cvs dispensers take less turns to open these gsk organizers are better for traveling more sturdy
this came and i ordered it off experiencing it from a friends place it isnt as high as the old seat cushion i used but its definitely better quality and comfortable cushion it only has this one issue of a really weird smell it smelled like it when it came thought it would go away and is simply a new product smell but has yet to go away overall though good product do wish it had a thicker variation maybe it does and i missed it however
this brush is twosided the only thing i like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back however i would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puffthe other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and i have to stretch to reach my entire back in addition the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me there is already a hole in the handle for hanginga selfadhesive hook is provided for hanging although i did not use thatin summary this is functional but is the least favorite back washer i tried so far also the current price of 1499 is outrageous for this
i really liked how this is a lot more comfortable than most rope most rope is really rough on your skin but this is really soft it would be much tougher to get rope burn than with most ropes but it holds really well too its also easy to tie knots withthis is about 32 feet of rope and so if youre going for some serious partner tying then you probably need about three skeins to completely tie someone upthe ends are taped and so theyll eventually fray if you plan on reusing this rope a lot then youll want to burn the ends so they dont fray its not ultrathick but this also means that it goes a lot farther than thicker ropethis comes in a few different colors and i like red the bestprosvery soft and comfortableperfect for adult restraint funholds fast without injuryattractive rope and colorsconsonly 32 feet 10 metersoomph gave me this rope to review
this is not three ply its two its usable in an emergency the texture is rough but really just a novelty gift that will gather dust until its regifted or thrown away the printing isnt centered per sheet so it loses some of it fun if it cant be read or the emoji is half missing still as a gag gift its good for a laugh not much else
best facial tissue manufactured ever in the course of human history yes i have tried them all even those ones that leave wooden splinters embedded in ones eye and nose ouch that was the moment when i decided to buy puffs plus with lotion exclusively i have accidentally washed  dry them  they never fall apart and ruin the wash load as others do fabulous tissue quality will never use any other tissue i love this tissue so much i subscribe it was exceedingly well packaged and arrived on time
super great taste and results are amazing
i had this bench in my cart for months i wasnt sure if i wanted to spend the money if it was not good quality finally i ordered it so i could have a place to sit and shave my legs in the shower it is heavy and of very good quality easy and fast to assemble it is high enough where i dont have to squat to sit its perfect
the next day upon  using the grabber it pinched my hand and i received a small cut from that all told the price is what attracted me so it didnt sway me i feel i got what i paid for no more no less
after seeing some reviews i can honestly say that this product is probably not for overweight people  im a 52 130lb woman and i loooovvvvveeee this cushion my butt and legs were going numb in my office chair so i bought this it feels squishy and soft yet supportive sitting on this makes me so happy its bouncy and fun and comes in a black zip cover
this is so easy to use it took me all of 2 seconds if that to check my temperature after reading the instructions there is a quick start instruction sheet and then the full instruction and care booklet you can check the ambient temperature of the room as well as check your temperature via the forehead or the ear canal i checked both and the reads were really close to the same temperature and both so easy to accomplish being digital is a big plus as wellit comes in a velvet bag for storage and cleaning instructions are very easy with no chemicals or alcohol necessary just a wet cloth i always have to use alcohol to wipe down my mouth thermometer so that no germs are transferred but this one doesnt touch saliva so the concern of sharing sickness is minimali highly recommend this product
great for icing my knee after acl reconstruction lighter than the chatanooga
love this product
it dissolves do nicely compared to other kava kava powders i find that at a dose of 12 tsp it is very mild again milder than some other kava powders ive used and creates a nice calm feeling good product good company
bought this for my neighbor and she loves it
these are pretty large pill boxes i can carry a weeks worth of pills in one of the boxes the plastic is pretty good quality latch is not fancy but feels secure enough
very efficient
i have this thermometer for 13 months and thanks god my kids are super healthy and they barely got sick my daughter got sick yesterday and had a very high fever and this thermometer was like a joke it gave me consecutive readings like 1045  1037  1019 1012 i tested both ear and forehead and no luck i knew she had a very high fever but i wanted to know exactly how much but with this thermometer that was not possiblei tried to call the customer service because they usually want to make the customer happybut not this timethey told me that as the warranty expired one month ago and they could not do anything i get thatbut i just thought a 24 thermometer will last more than one year so i guess i need to buy another thermometer but im not buying innovo ever again
this product is great to put on every so often to try and prevent diaper rash i like this product too as the smaller size is perfect for the diaper bag i recommend only have 2 pictured but it came with 3 and dont get confused it is a smaller tube but as i mentioned perfect for travel
little to no taste  i just added the powder to smoothies and it was fine  didnt really alter the taste of the smoothie at all  the bag is a decent quality but i find these fine powders sometimes get stuck in the zip lock so dumping them in a jar has been my preferred storage way
looking forward to using this product in a couple of weeks
trying to find a way to incorporate apple cider vinegar into our diets what could be easier than gummies they taste good and theyre effective
there is no research to suggest that cordyceps mycelium is medicinal all the research is on the fruiting body or what most people actually think of as the mushroom
i am surprised at how heavy and well made they are  they really do what they state  it is very easy now to lay in bed and watch tv without causing pain in my neck  i didnt really like reading with them because i need reading glasses so trying to wear two pair of glasses at the same time is just not comfortable for me  my husband liked them so much that even though he doesnt have a neck injury he wants a pair just because he said it was so comfortable watching tv laying flat on your back
i used them for led light therapy i wish they blocked more light out they stick to your eyes so be careful i pushed them down to block out more light and getting them to unstick to my eyelids wasnt fun probably better for tanning
so easy to dust furniture without long edges of a rag trailing behind i love that my hand can grip curved edges and get each and every single bit of dust
i have 105 straws they are a great size for larger cups but they are a little tall for my normal starbucks drink i bought this shorter size so i didnt have quite so much straw sticking up over my cup this has been great and i dont feel like i might impale myself on my latte straw anymore ive also used in a standard 12 oz can of soda and have been happywhat makes this set really stand out compared to others i have purchased is that it comes with the carry bag and the straw brushes thats super helpful especially if this is a first straw purchase
the hotcold therapy pack is great i mainly use it as an ice pack  just strap it on and sit back and relax
im allergic to pretty much everything so these softener dryer sheets are a lifesaver they do not irritate my skin at all
the material of this toothbrush feels cheap and light but the performance was good i think this toothbrush is more to use outside the house like in an office or traveling its portable by that i mean its a smaller size than my regular toothbrush the power was good and cleaned my teeth well
might as well put this on subscription use this all the time for camping and beach i dont smell horrible and it makes my skin feel great
saved me from getting seasick
i use ziploc bags frequently because they make highquality products  having the seahawks logo on the bag makes it that much more special in this washingtonbased home clear bags are a must for attending games plus when youre making special gifts for fellow seahawks fans this bag makes for a perfect presentation  go seahawks
this product looks cool and i thought i would like it however its a bit difficult to open and there have been several times where ive opened it and the meds have spilled out
thank you
works well in foods and as a supplement  i have used this product before and a little goes a long ways
ive had it for about a week and so far so good i think you never know with cats though you know what i mean i love kittens but i cant stand adult cats so finding out that some random cat has been messing with my outdoor plants certainly doesnt help their cause i thought about buying a zapper mat or motion detector spray but neither is workable for outside and although i personally hate cats im the only one in my family that feels this way so i thought this would be more humane it smells like big red gum to me  im very happy that it doesnt smell like a bunch of disgusting chemicals  and because it can be used outside and is safe for plants and is supposed to stick around even if it rains it seemed perfect also i hate the thought of me having to invest any money into cat related crap so this seemed like the most economical choice too i sprayed it every night the first 3 nights including one night when it rained and then i forgot to spray it the next day so its been every other day since so far my plants have remained untouched but i have no idea if its because of the spray or because the stupid cat just hasnt been around to harass my plants yet if my plants remain untouched after a month i think ill be convinced and begrudgingly buy this spray again when i run out
these look better for men instead of women
these arent 100 effective but theyre more convenient long lasting  durable than anything you can make they dont last forever though eventually the filter will get pretty stinky and youll want to replace it but for this price  how long you can use it its still worth the investment
ive had insomnia for 2 decades  its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel even when im in a room far from elevators snack machines etclast week we went to atlantic city for a few days  i was lucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snackice machines but i knew that wouldnt be enough  i took a silk sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the beston the first night i was exhausted from driving and walking around all daynight yet i couldnt sleep then i remembered i had packed the mask and ear plugs so i climbed out of bed and got them from my bag  boy did the mask make it nice and dark  the earplugs blessedly gave me total silence as well i did not fall asleep immediately but sleep did come and that rarely happens for me on vacation  i usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake what a nice surprise to actually be able to get a few hours of sleepthe mask darkened the room tremendously even the next morning when i woke up to a sunny bright and cloudless day the room was still dark for me thanks to the mask  the mask was nice and soft and the mask itself was comfortable the band that went around my head was very tight and took a bit for me to get used to  the earplugs did a glorious job of drowning out my husbands horrific snoring  on the second night i was able to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed asleep through the night thanks to the mask that kept the light out of the room and the earplugs which by the way are very comfortable and flexible and soft  that kept the horrific snoring sounds as well as the maids cart noises from the hallway silentso glad i had the mask and earplugs with me i was actually able to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them
this is comforting wasnt into the music it was nice that this came charged right out of the box so you could use it right away unfortunately it has an older usb port
works well on most surfaces
i have tried a few different facial scrubs and was very disappointed in this one  i have another tube of scrub similar to this one that i refuse to use  i will be purchasing my favorite real scrub when my current tube is nearly out  it is about half gone now so it shouldnt be too long  what i like about my facial scrub is that it has plenty of scrubbies in the paste that i put on my face  that way i can get all the dry flaky skin off my face clearing the way for new clean skin to be washed with a gentle soap and then moisturized with a light facial oil  i have dry skin as i am older  i dont have dual skin with oily and dry patches  i have dry skin period  the scrubbing granules in my favorite facial scrub ensures that all the old skin is gone  this product is so wimpy  it has barely anything scrubby in the paste meaning i would need to use about half the tube just to get enough scrubbies on my face to get rid of the dead dry skin on my face especially on my forehead and around my nose  just not worth it for my particular skin
i have no idea what bilberry does so let me say that first  we take these for general eye health and vision issues such as night blindness affected us ppl who are older   the lutein and the zeaxanthin were both recommended by our eye dr  there are 60 in this bottle so it gives a one month supply to us  both are made from marigold extracts
good product  do the work
first let me start off by saying i did not have this for more than a night i returned it quite quickly it smelled quite toxic which possibly could of faded with time but i was not interested in waiting for that on top of this i just wasnt comfortable for me to sit on its quite firm and it raises you a bit more extensively off of whatever youre sitting on than i thought just not for me plus its rather expensive
great product relieves upset stomach as well as heartburn
i used these inserts to reduce the volume on a shoe that had a bit too much room in the toebox  i followed the included directions cutting the insert to size and then used a hair dryer to heat mold them inside the shoes be careful if doing this on shoes with plastic parts the ones i was using them in were leather so molding them in place wasnt a concern  after molding they fit and feel great recommended
very good and clear sounding speaker it definitely works better than i thought it would it has several different sounds that was not expected great purchase
the addition of this pad took our 15 year old massage table to the next level while i would have liked for the pad to be a little thicker it is a great value and we are very happy with iti think it would easily fit a larger table and it is advertised to fit up to a 34 x 76 tablewe have only used the cool side so far
good product  just need to be careful to line the battery with the charger 34prongs34  or will not charge correctly  exactly what we needed for our phone
i had been using emjoi battery operated micro unit for years had tried others but they dont come anywhere this companys products when i saw this was available i couldnt wait to order quick efficient and does just as prescribed one of my favorite purchases
i wasnt to happy with this purchase as its just too hard and not comfortable  if you are not using it as a neck roll then perhaps it would work for you but if you are it wouldnt be the right purchase
these last about 1 hour of continual comfortable hear  about 1 inch across  all these types seem pricy for a chinese product
we bought this to keep the horde of feral cats in our neighborhood from using our front yard as a litter box we followed the directions and even extended the daily application by 4 days but  it did very little to deter them from using our mulched area as a bathroom if keeping wild cats out of your yard is your intended purpose for this spary my experience is that it doesnt do the trick
reasonably priced and a great natural supplement to help ward off bad things  super fast shipping too
this fish oil comes in well packaged and sealed as well as clear in its 50day quantity as well as expiration date and various other contents the fish oil capsule slowly melts in the mouth and it tastes delicious
love it came on time works great and no complaints fantastic
these are exactly as described and what i expected herb combo size heat delivery so if the description suits what you think your after then dont hesitate arrived quickly and well packaged i appreciate the inclusion of paper shields for ifwhen desired or needed i thought it was a decent price too  if you are not experienced with this sort of thing you should do some web searching for videos on moxibustion treatment or have your acupuncturist show you theres a lot of good info available these light very easily  just as expected
puffs are very low quality thin and not nearly as soft as other lotion tissue the price was not much different so i feel the value is low buy kleenex or one of many store brands that are far better quality
bought this for a friend and it works great also try looking for a shirt with drain holder pockets the mesh holder is good but my friend uses a ziplock bag for the shower and then puts them in the mesh bag maybe try to find something water resistant to avoid getting too much water on them
love these  finally a place for larger pills
i got this as a gift for my nephew who is struggling with depression and medical problems the black tourmaline is perfect to cleanse his space of negative energy and will promote healing he loved it and really enjoyed spreading out the branches and leaves to his liking this is a great gift and the black tourmaline is beautiful
i have fibromyalgia and use this to loosen up my shoulders and relief the pain  it works very well  you need a small amount so the tube last longer than you think it would  the smell is very strong when you put it on my cat runs from the room but gets very light quickly  just make sure to wash your hands immediately after use
i wasnt impressed with this set  the minute i removed this stainless steel roller from the box the roller part fell off the rod this is a stainless steel roller not a natural jade stone so its heavier and the handle appeared unable to support the topheavy roller the gua sha silver stone was alright but the roller was obviously not made well if the head broke off upon first use i used a pair of pliers to fix it but am not impressed i think ill stick with the natural jade stone or rose quartz ones
perfect i have been using it for the last 6 months and works as advertised
got for my daughter it helps her so great buy
no dislike at all love the toothpaste
i have issues with my feet a chiropractor showed me how to relieve the pain by using a golf ball and rolling it around with the area of my foot that happens these inserts help prevent that from happening and i can do without the golf ball
i sprayed a biking backpack that i wear when i ride my bike  i often carry food and a lot of stuff in it and it always gets grimy  i washed it once in the machine and it did ok but i decided to spray it all over with this spray  it went on fine  the family said it had a smell but i could barely detect it  i had enough to lay on two coats with some left over  i havent used my backpack yet but i needed to get a review up in time so i will update it if i think it doesnt work as advertised
these are stabby
this has helped our 4yearold son who is displaying some signs of autism tremendously  since beginning the fish oil he is sleeping better having more regular bowel movements and fewer accidents in his underwear talking more playing with toys more appropriately and answering questions without simply repeating the question back to us  the flavor is wonderful and does not taste fishy at all  i mix it for the kids in yogurt and they gobble it down  this fish oil has truly made a remarkable difference for us and we will be customers for life
the gooad dog clippers work well and are surprisingly quiet this is great when trimming as my dog is skittish the rechargeable batteries and extra attachments make this a great value
while it didnt miraculously make my teeth as white as snow it did make them a bit lighter the instructions it comes with leave much to be desired they are very vague it comes with whitening strips packets the light machine and silicone teeth mold first thing to do you have to open the battery holder there is a paper disk between two flat batteries to prevent them from running out since the button on the top is so sensitive small accidental touch will turn it onthe strips come in two sizes  short and long i tried both sizes on both sets of teeth and determined that longer goes on the top teeth and the short one goes on the lower teeth it would have been nice to have it confirmed in the instructions the whitening cycle times vary from 3045 minutes with the requirement not to eat or drink one hour afterwards the whitening light machine shuts off every 10 minutes on the dot as if to remind not to leave it in too long first time my teeth felt tingly and slightly cool but then nothing out of ordinary happened since it has to stay put in there for a while the saliva that collects behind the teeth has to go somewhere i swallowed it it was not overly unpleasant with slight traces of something its ok whitening kit but it does not perform miracle
i wanted something a little bit different these are just right
anything with gerry in it gets 5 stars automatically d it arrived quickly and in good condition which is always a concern with printed materials
i have read that glyconutrient therapy helps punch up the immune system to ward off viruses i am all for this and was also looking for a supplement that will help level out our blood sugars since taking this product i cant say that it is a miracle drug of some kind but can say that my blood sugars have remained normal when before they would periodically read high and i have not come down with a cold or flu knock on wood so is it working  id have to say so its kind of like 34elephant repellant34 if you spray some around and never see an elephant is it working
using this on my 6 month old baby for nebulizer works great
product seems well made i have the one with extra padding the bad part is the strength of the massage  its simply too low its weaker than the handheld massage devices in my opinion i cannot see how anyone with a serious ailment gets any relief from this even at highest settings i did not feel it to be effective and heat was not working at all or felt like itdoes not look like it will be comfortable or recommend to put it on a sitting position this also occupies considerable amount of space so if you have people sitting at same location you will need to move it each time
these are super cheap plastic the head doesnt even move just the handle not worth it
returned for a shorter half roll this was not the right roller
one of the better variety of balance bars varieties super yummy candy bar like i almost wish i had never even found or tried these because they are almost too good
great product  it works great  easy to use must buy
i was amazed at its performance but i decided not to buy it instead something else no biggy
fits better than the knockoffs but pricey since model is discontinued
so the pump did not come with the package  personally i dont care because i have other ways to inflate the bowl  but because people that may not have that ability this really pisses me off  very unfortunate because the device does work if you can inflate it  fyi my husband is disabled and bedridden  i am 15 years younger than him so i worked thru this issue  but if you dont have that ability dont buy this item
i put one in my tiny office and another in my living room to help with cigarette smoke and animal odors  i have not noticed one bit of difference in the smell of my home since i put them in  i gave them two months and now of course cannot return them  there is absolutely no change in either room and both rooms have no change in the air quality
based on the good reviews i was hoping this would be better i have a herniated disc between l5 and s1 this product is very large and very hard it hurt my back so i will be donating it to a friends father who is in a wheelchair
will see if the duration was worth the investment product works  just need to determine cost
these socks are great the fabric is soft smooth lovely feels really nice next to my skin i love how colorful  fun these compression socks are because all ive found up until now were just drab tan black or white stockings that looked hideous just because i have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities feet calves doesnt mean i want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose these are so cute bright  colorful the only downside is that i am wearing these due to leg swelling  when my calves are real swollen which is often unfortunately the design on some of these socks gets stretched out causing you to lose the very thing that makes these so pretty the design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost on some designs  not so colorful this hasnt happened on all the socks ive purchased from this maker i have about 6 pairs but definitely on some if youre on the thin side or dont experience much swelling this probably wont be a problem at all a solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes like small  large
works greattip dont advance the dosage too fast or it can make you sicker as it activates dormant detox pathways and dont give up on it if you feel worse just cut back until you find the easy safe dose then let your cravings for it control your intake from there your mind will think about it and taste crave it when its time use this with remyte it works well together their other product dont make much sense to me ymmvit tastes exactly like magnesium chloride so i dont believe the sellers claim that chloride is removed
arrives in an extraordinary wellengineered conformal package the pictured box arrives within a box kudos to the productdesigners who chose this outstanding packaging methodthe oil quality is the lightest i can recall and absolutely tasteless the glass bottle and stopper are countertop accent qualitymuch better than expected topqualitywas my review helpful if so click helpful so i can know
absolutely fantastic  i use it daily when i shower  great relief for dry itchy skin
excellent product mixes beautifully well with water making it easy for onthego portability i have also blended it with fresh strawberries as well as fresh blackberries for a twist on lemonade this will be a regular item tastes great especially when it is hot outside would highly recommend it
this could be a useful mini razor for traveling i say could since i cant say how well it shaves  i was never able to get it to turn on i initially thought it was shipped with a discharged battery which is sometimes the case with rechargeable products however after letting it charge for a few hours it still would not turn on the shaver got rather warm while charging and the charge indicator light turned on but those were the only indications of lifethe design is something ive not come across before its a rotary shaver but the heads are arranged in a straight line the heads are smaller than is customary on a rotary the construction is all plastic and feels rather cheap still it has some nice grip points and feels pretty good in hand as a travel shaver the lightweight nature and the smaller size could be plussessince it failed to turn on at all the only rating i can give is 1 star a shame since i would have liked to see the shaving performance of the lineararranged rotary heads
mounting bracket would not tighten because the material is too weak  i bent the bracket to fit tighter but it just bent back when tightening  i finally screwed the bracket to the column by drilling and tappinghooks for the basket were too tight to install it  had to be reshaped to be functional
ordered wrong one but still can use it
this is the best product in the market i swear by it just like the people on the my big fat greek wedding i always say 34did you put some glycerin on it34 my pimple put some at night  over night it reduces the swelling and makes it ready to 34pop34 in the morning i dont even dilute it with anything
i like it despite some reviews i have decided to buy and it worked great i used in couple of projects once as an additive to epoxy glue and it is brighter and longer than a lot of medium and higher class watch hands
doesnt do for my big size catbrush is very not flexible hardmy cat doesnt like it at all
this is my third purchase of better sleep earplugs i love them hubby had had his nose broken seven times football so he doesnt just snore his nose speaks alien languages im not the best at caring for them i just pull them out and put them on the head of the bed then sometimes the cats bat  them around or the grandkids in residence mix them with playdohbut thats okay because these earplugs are washableafter 812 months i replace themtheyre a bargain because they really work
i dont tolerate all peppermint well  i have both acid reflux and a hiatal hernia so somethings help some make it worsei tried these and they have a soft taste you get the peppermint but it doesnt irritate going downrecommended for those who want a smoooooth peppermint to just ease a tummy issue like upset nauseawill keep these as a staple in my medicine chest and kitchen cupboard  oh and i like the tin
overall its not bad i have had better tasting types of hydration packets or powders see nuun i think that while the salt count is fairly low compared to other brands the saltiness stands out more with this brand overall it does what it needs to do and i feel equally as good after my runs as i do with other brands i think based on price alone i would purchase again since this brand appears to be slightly cheaper than other brands for the quantity offered overall i would give a 75 out of 10
i try to wash my face very infrequently when possible because overwashing just gets it to produce more oils  but when i need to remove makeup or i will wash my face anyway shower i really like this wash  it seems completely natural gentle and i dont feel it chipping away at my microbiomeseems to be a health and ecoconscious product
my husband likes his and highly recommends this item
the only sturdy travel transparent case out there
update  after 6 months of on and off usage i would guess about 125 wearings the main band hookandloop velcro is one brand of hookandloop type closure is shot  the 2 straps start separating as soon as they are attached one good cough or bending over and scritchit pops open  i am most certainly not a big person so i am not stressing the connection in that respect all hookand loop does wear out the hooks start to get straightened out with repeated pulls of the loop side and subsequently they stop grabbing and holding the loop  the highest quality products have thick stout hooks that last a very long time  i feel that should you plan on wearing this item everyday you may be buying 2 or 3 a year  aside from this issue rendering the brace unwearable i still feel this is a fantastic braceoriginal postthis is not the first posture corrector i  have purchased through amazon but it will be the last  this is a very well engineered and constructed product and i commend the sellermanufacturer on delivering a corrector that actually worksi had been going through progressive slouching shoulder slump and fhp forward head positionto the layman like me that just means not looking straight ahead but down to differing degrees  i had been told that i was looking down all the time  in actively assessing myself i found that to be true  this observation of slumping over and head position led me to understand why i was going through progressive upper back shoulder and neck pain  every morning and evening i was on an acetaminophen and ibuprofen regimenmy previous posture corrector experience was awful  poorly engineered uncomfortable and one size fits all seems to be the normin receiving this product box i was a bit apprehensive  i didnt want further disappointment  i gave this purchase a 4 star review for two reasons  i really want to give a 5 star review because the product actually works as advertised but there are a couple of issues if i could give a 45 star review i would for better or worse positive change occurs on amazon through the process of accurate and honest reviewsmy first reason for not rating my experience as a 5 may seem petty to some but i feel it has importance  on opening the box and removing the brace there was not a single stitch of product literature included  in my humble opinion basic information regarding the product itself guarantee explanation with returnrefund information and some basic seller contact information should have been included  there were none of the pages that can be seen on the amazon website that are just great  copies of the photos and fitting instructions should also have been with the product i was going back and forth between my computer and my bathroom mirror to assure proper fitment when i first put this on it did not feel right and i found that i was wearing it too low by looking at the photo of the model  for future reference when not logged on to the computer having package inserts would be fantasticnow to the corrector once i was properly fitted it was immediately obvious that this device was going to prove beneficial  when i first strapped it on it seemed that i would only receive moderate correction  i realized that i was not holding my shoulders neck and head up straight and in proper alignment before stretching and attaching the shoulder straps to the belly band  upon doing this correctly a significant amount of support was felt  by pulling pretty tight on the straps while in proper posture before attachment of the bands my alignment is now perfect my posture without the corrector was poorbut not as bad as i have seen with other people in order to retain proper alignment with the corrector i had to give the straps a pretty good stretch  i am 51134 tall and 190 pounds  it is only reasonable that the device straps will have to be pulled tighter for a bulkier person there is just going to be more physical resistance to correction if you are smaller than me such tension may not be requiredthis is where my second issue is keeping me from a 5 star review comes up  for those of use requiring extra tension on the straps to maintain proper spinal alignment the straps can 34cut34 into the armpits to an uncomfortable degree  some sort of well designed underarm cushioning would be greatly appreciatedlastly i can only wear this brace for about 2 hours before my back muscles start aching  i do not consider this to be a negative in any wayactually it is quite the opposite  this lets me know the brace is working as advertised  those muscles in my back have been stretching and stretching over the years and are at the heart of my poor posture  they are not enjoying being 34recompressed34  tough  over time muscle fibers begin to grow together  this corrector i feel will facilitate just that take tension off the brace as soon as you begin to feel any of the aching i have described above  continued use after that point will cause discomfort for some time after the brace is removed  for some people i imagine this period of initial correction may be as short as 45 minutes to an hour perhaps even less for the elderlyi am going to get one for my 70 year old mother if she gives in to trying it it takes time to gain new muscle memory  the longer you use the device every day the length of time you will be able to wear it comfortably will most likely extend in using this corrector these aching muscles will begin to calm down over time  the support is not just holding things in place it is forcing the body to improve itself  i fully believe that actual postural healing will take place and down the road i will only need the support as a  reminder rather than a maintaineri wear a tshirt every day and even when tightly tucked in the corrector is virtually invisible underneath it  from when i first put the corrector on in the morning i do not take it off until bedtime  i simply go through comfortable cycles of tensioning the main strap and releasing it when i feel it is neededthe device is lightweight and unobtrusive  only the tightest or sheerest of clothing would give away its presencebravo tigoof  you really have a winner here and i highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing postural issues such as mine slouching forward head position and shoulder slumping and suffering from the chronic neck and shoulder pain that i was  as an aside my working at the computer for any extended period of time would get to feeling fiery in the upper back i dont do computer work now without the brace  and no longer experience that discomfort i highly recommend this support to long duration computer usersthis is a fantastic product you should feel very secure in purchasing  the few negative things i mentioned are more than likely issues specific to me or perhaps to other people my size or larger  i am confident that if you order the correct size and find the justright fit for you this corrector will prove itself to be quite an asset  if you dont feel just that way contact the seller  they are fantastic to work with  i cant wait for my few issues to be dealt with in some fashion for all future purchasers so i can i can come back and give this product a solid 5 star rating i couldnt be more pleased with my purchasegood day  good backstlaffoon
the mask is easy to cleanhas elastic to hold on the childs head but it runs smallit did not fit my nine year oldest face it also has a strong chemical smell
so far so good i watched the cats on our cameras turn away from where i sprayed this product the only problem is you need to spray it about every other day i hope this continues to work or the next stop for the cats is the humane league
great product would buy again
fits better than the original on my arm
kind of bulky it does the job
i was soso with this product  i was thinking it was ok if you wanted to spend the money  then i fell  a stupid fall no need to explain  with 60 as my next birthday i was in some severe pain  i thoughtcopper calf compression sleeveswhy  well i totally wiped out my right calfnot in the back but the front  i fell duh  i am now a convert  there is nothing greater than copper sleeves  i now have elbow and hand gloves  this company rocks it cool
really liked this as did everyone who smelled it wish the bottle would have been a little bigger and the shower gel didnt smell very long
one of the finest whey isolate protein powders available  fantastic for the lactose intolerant  flavors that are some of the best i have ever had  this one is for the chocolate  best chocolate ever
this is a great back brace  the only issue is that i bought it for my 80year old father and it is difficult for him to put it on himself  well constructed and comfortable even when pulled quite tight  definitely helps with posture
also i like that the days can be separated
it clean the way they say
bought this to help with bruising after surgery and i think it worked a bit but i didnt use it more than a week or so and i also used ice so im not sure
put it in and it fits fine around my car seat  i dont think any cartruck seat will have a problem if it is a bucket seat i will test it out and adjust the review if i have any issues  so far it seems supportive  i like the fact that there is no memory foam so no odor  it came shipped in a big box so no issues with the quality of the product upon arrival  if i can figure out where i put my calcium everything would be greatupdateair freshner smell stuck to product and does not smell like lavender  returned
very disappointed would not hold liquid the opening kept popping open woke up two mornings with an empty brush would not recommend went back to an oxo brand brush with a screw on dispenser
this review process with amazon has changed you read reviews to a product that has nothing to do with the product your looking at
easy to breath in  very big  easier to talk in  washes well
pretty sweet and has the artificial taste of an orange starburst not really a flavor i want in a drink someone that doesnt mind artificially sweetened drinks may not find the flavor to be an issuewould highly recommend using cold water to drink this down because it helps cut the sickly sweetnessi took half a scoop midday which comes out to 125mg of caffeine about the strength of a cup of coffeei didnt feel too jittery anxious or crazy just a little more up and focused during my workoutso overall i didnt care too much for the flavor but i enjoy the effects so ill continue to use it and just drink it quickly haha
these lens wipes work really well and were very happy with them good price for so many of them
its really good i am using every day good for health
purchased this to add in a smoothie recipe  this is fantastic flavor and i am sure packed with major nutrients  i would definitely recommend to someone who makes smoothies all of the time  i put a teaspoon in blender with frozen cherries banana orange juice and it was spectacular  will purchase again
solves a common problem almost everyone who has ever used an ace bandage for more than a day or two has lost some if not all the clips and dropping a clip onto a hard floor and accidently stepping on it renders it useless so what do you do when you need to use that ace bandage but have too few or worse yet no clips at all ive tried using safety pins as an alternative when i have no clips but found that is really not a good solution as it does not hold the end of the bandage evenly this pack of 50 clips will last a long time and im glad that its a pack of 50 as they are not really durable so they have to be replaced fairly often like 34 days but they are a much better alternative than to safety pins and certainly buying another expensive ace bandage they also come in handy to use on a really wide ace bandage as the number of clips supplied by ace seems inadequate im glad i bought them
good product  buy them all the time
this item really should not be sold here as it is temperature sensitive and needs to be shipped with an ice pack during the warm months who knows what the temps are in the amazon warehouses i would say to stick with buying this from your local practitioner because after it has been subjected to the heat it probably is no longer good at all or less strength at best waste of money to buy a probiotic that no longer works
these are super soft and nice i give lower rating because when a few hours they were flattened and hard i realize it will in time but expected it would still provide some cushion
to me there is nothing like a full mesh body puff it is the only thing i use in the shower outside of a back brush nevertheless these mitts have the best of two worlds the mesh is thin and sewn onto the glove the glove has two finger holes for the thumb depending on which side is being used if i want a sudsy wash i pull this on like a glove and use the mesh side if i want to exfoliate i turn it over and use the rough side it also has a loop for hangingit does not replace my favorite shower sponge but this comes close also these can be used to wash the dishes if one does not want to use them for the showerthe current price of 1398 comes to an expensive 699 per mitt
i do like this product but it only has one hot temperature and although it has buttons to adjust the temperature of the brush they dont do anything
so far the pills are fine and easy to take and thank you for the quick mailing them
my boyfriend needed a new clipper and cordless seemed the best option  i can help him and hed have a easier time cutting his hair  these clippers are amazin  trust me
i was pleasantly surprised how these pads helped easy pain on the balls of my feet when wearing heels i was skeptical but now im not recommended
very soft easy to put on there are strands of the yarn poking through the front so i dont know how well it will wear over time
bought this for my niece she loves it
these seemed to work well at first but they loose their effectiveness after a while dont work as well as they are supposed to
this machine is amazing it has many different attachments and gets you where you want to be great price too i was going to order elsewhere and they wanted like 150 and this is way less and comes with way more its strong and is well worth the buy
got this for my son for christmas  he loves it hes a welder in a machine shop and his body pays a price it arrived today and he tested it out at my urging with no real hope for it doing muchhes had other products in the past and nothing really gets into deep tissue and reverberates out and makes a difference for him to have any relief  i did his back for 10 mins with thisand he was smiling not to make his mom feel good but because something finally got his muscles to relax  the 2 heads on this are what i think do the trick for making it all happen  the various speeds and alternate attachments will be an added benefit in the long run  its easy to balance and he managed as well to do it but not as good as when someone else does it lol
i got these they were a great deal but i feel like they stink until you get used to them they are somewhat soft but not like id expect from tissue with lotion
it has the touch and strength of highend plastic cutlery labeled compostable in industrial facilities and that you should check locally as these do not exist in many communities it probably goes without saying that these are not suitable for backyard composting the bonus is that these are made from renewable sources
went to the dentist for a fitted plastic retainer for 150 and use this at night amazing whitening with zero gum or tooth pain crest white strips hurt my gums
useless the spring is bigger and coarser than other brands ive tried and didnt even epilate  i felt nothing pulling or epilating when i used it but did when i  immediately tried  my older wand from another company  i threw these 2 away  thankfully they were not expensive  ive learned bellabe is worth the extra money
when i was growing up my mother was always trying to sneak healthy ingredients into our food without us knowing spirulina powder is a much more subtle way of doing just that mixing it in with acidic sauces or dressings completely mask the flavor i add it to spaghetti and lasagna and no one suspects a thing great way to sneak in some iron and protein
its kind of hard to mess up basic dish gloves these are pretty standard gloves and they perform just as well as any others ive ever used the center of the palm has slightly textured area to improve your trip on wet dishes im allergic to latex and these did not cause any rash hives or redness and itching so they seem to actually be latex free
these eyeglass cases are very handy and cute  they fit in my purse really well  the order came quickly  i was pleased
love but a bit on the heavy side
these masks are super cute and comfortable the stretchy band could be just a hair larger or even adjustable but other then that they are great i love there is a pocket for the gel pack i get migraines often so these are so helpful
great for cake pops
my rocking santa is a whimsical addition to my window sill i enjoy seeing him rocking
the last time i ever smelled smelling salts was when i was a kid and another kid in the neighborhood had a bottle of them for some reason  we all smelled it and i havent forgotten how strong it smelled  these westside barbell smelling salts are just as strong  however this time i used the technique i learned in chemistry class in college which was not to stick my nose right over the flask beaker or whatever container but to hold it out from my face and waft the air over it with my hand towards my snout  these are very good smelling salts
1st day had a headache and jaws were clinched  waited a few days because i wanted focus and memory and tried with 12 of a capsule and stayed on that dose for a week without any headache or clinched jaw side effects  after a week went to 1 full capsule and love the results  i have so much energy drive motivation focus and ability to remember  i really think that at 67 i have lost a lot of my 34mind34  with optimind i am back like i was in my 20s  if you think it is expensive call them and order 6 bottles at a time it gets the cost down to 25 a bottle  my husband who usually just laughs at my supplements tried one he takes one daily now  both of us love what it does for our mind and energy  after 3 weeks on them thought i probably should take a day and rest well i did rest after cleaning out the garage cleaning my car inside and out two hours of  shopping and coming home to fix dinner  before optimind i would open the garage door look at the mess and close the door  it all seemed like too big of a job most supplements are hype not optimind  not sure why it didnt work for the people that rated it anything less than a 5 unless they are some of the few people that still have their 34minds34 intact  ill gladly give up other things to afford optimind  besides with optimind i save money from not paying others to do what i was too tired to do or couldnt focus or think clearly enough to do
arrived on time strength equipment to others of same strength narrow rimless lens perfect for reading  watching tv at same time
i finally found the readers that do not look like readers  i have been looking for this specific design for well over a year the packing is lovely  a glass zippered case with wipe cloth looks exactly like in picture  i love these and will order extra pair
used it for less than two months and it dieddo not buy
bought the 2 pack one for my 94 year old grandma and another for my nephews only used it with my grandma but i know my nephews will get a kick out of it too i used to have them when i was young my grandma and i both enjoyed them keep in mind the measurements theyre pretty small
lovely aroma it smells also like cologne its really strong but i got used to it after one day many happy compliments from anyone that has gotten into my car
these are a great solution for lifes little inconsistencies  very comfortable and discreet i would recommend this product
we been using it since 2016 the germ guardian gg1000 7 pluggable small air purifier  and it works  we use it in the bathroom never had a problem with it
some of them fit and are a really neat concept but all of them are basically cut different sizes and shapes i would rather have something tighter fitting to use a device all of the finger lengths are random a stretchy fabric would be helpful even a 5050 cotton blend
this is an excellent hair styling tool my hair is difficult to have lasting curlswaves but with this my hair style lasts for at least two daysi definitely recommend this onei give it two big thumbs up
this was an inexpensive piece to roll cones but honestly i found this to be difficult to use  its really hard to fill after rolling paper around it  it becomes a frustrating situation to the point where i roll cones by hand quicker than using this tool
seemed to really help my adrenal fatigue
cute small boxes the color pops they came very well packaged so none came in bent
no better than drugstore hot water bottle
im sorry to say that my bottle arrives busted and therefor i couldnt really use it i sopped up some of the loose liquid and worked it into a stone floor i knew exactly what i was planning to use this on so i got straight to it i just have one spot in my late 30s early 40s sears kit home that has an unsealed rough stone floor i have been wanting to find something that could clean that floor nothing ever describes what i have so i have been reticent to buy anything so i havent used anything when i saw that this product can be used on pavers bricks sidewalks etc i figured that was much closer to what i have in terms of porosity so here i am with a busted bottle and just a rags worth of product and i dab it onto one spot it really seems promising this isnt a case of oh i can use anything and i certainly cant use a power washer hm maybe a steamer but yeh i need a cleaner this could be it but i dont have enough to work with i am highly considering just buying another bottle but concerned about another broken bottle personally i think the price point is reasonable hence why i never rate on price if i do buy another bottle currently have one sitting in my cart i will be back to update
i figured id try the vanilla since i do like a couple of other flavors but this flavor is awful it doesnt even taste like vanilla
the container are only half filled and its not smooth but it seem to work on the itchy bites i used it on flea bites
i bought these for giving my baked goods to friends they are just the right size sturdy and even more beautiful in person than in the photos instead of light pink ribbons shown in the ad mine are a hot pink which makes the boxes pop to life the thank you cards are a lovely ecru color and are packaged in clear resealable plastic 2 packages of 6 the cards have matching envelopes and are the quality you would expect to find in high end boutiques this set really deserves 10 stars they can be used for so many thingstrinkets birthdays valentines day wedding showers the boxes are the perfect size and the price is very affordable for such luxury thank you amazon for this great set
the case was over all a buy it holds my mlg gunnars fine and is a nice coated leather the only issue that i would say it has is that it is kind of flimsy when opening however the magnets hold when the case is closed
neem oil is great for hair and skin it helps strengthen strands and improves elasticity it encourages hair growth and can prevent unnecessary shedding it is also good for fighting wrinkles the capsules are filled with oil you can easily puncture them with a thumbtack or sewing needle and add them to either hair or skin products another great use is to add some to your favorite clay mask to make it dry down slower i think this is a great buythanks so much for reading this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
these were hideous i tried to pawn them off and no one likes them it ended up being a food we tricked people to eat as a joke
for the price point this is an excellent cuticle nipper the edge is shard and precise comparable in quality to a 20 nipper
these are nice paper towels both with looks and function theyre thicker than any ive used and much more absorbent too they have perforations and theyre easy to tear off one but the paper towels themselves arent easily torn ive been quite pleased with them
i love camu camu for an extra vitamin c boost  i sprinkle it very lightly into shakes as such potent vitamin c has laxative powers  so start small  yay for organic
took all stains out off clothes then other brands
folks these earplugs pose a risk of getting stuck deep inside your ear i see from the reviews im not the only onei only wore these a couple of times one of them got stuck in my ear canal these are silicone and extremely small but dont have stemshandles like other other silicone earplugs to prevent them from adhering deep inside your ear canal if my rn friend had not been able to extract the earplug i wouldve had to go to urgent care or the er getting something like this stuck in your ear could potentially damage your hearingi urge you to buy other earplugs potentially with stemshandles youre trying to protect your hearing  not risk it
most of us know that maca is a superfood well this is amped up superfood from peru that aids the body in healing boosting the immune system and filled with amino acids that are fuel for out bodies there is no taste to it so i put a tsp in my smoothies along with maca and a warrior blend plant based protein powder that i know will give me all i need as i cant eat due to dental surgery
i was really excited to get this for my husband but the power button does not work it only turns on if i push the speed button but since that turns it on i cant change the speed if my husband tries to put any pressure on it lay his neck on it it just shuts off very disappointed
nice thick nail files
i need co to repond to this question why was label saying 50 knotweed placed over the original that says 20  which is it
husband loves this warm and cozy item  should have had one in the beginning
this spotlight toothpaste says its vegan and claims to rebuild enamel but i showed this to my dentist and she was skeptical she recommends sensodyne which has much stronger ingredients to fight tooth decay and eroding enamel i suspected as much  i didnt like the texture of this toothpaste and though it does have fluoride thank goodness i dont feel the same sensation of cleanliness i get with colgate total or sensodyne it feels very mild and there is no foaming action there are many obscure toothpastes like these on the market that claim to be healthier but i have yet to find any equivalent to whats already working for me oh well
these were surprisingly great quality and easy to put together they scratched off perfectly and were a lot of fun for the guest at our bridal shower
great in a smoothie
replaced our sound machine that we had for many years  perfect white noise
sadly as cute as they are the scent didnt last more than a day i will use them all but i dont think i will return for more
i gave a five star for this product is great the taste is hard to get used too but i mix it in 100 grape juice and it is very good the juice is good for you plus the energy greens and i feel wonderful i am 73 yrs old and i can work rings around my husband and  kids i will continue to take the all day energy greens as long as i can afford it
these little nail buffers are not just for doing nails they are great for all sorts of projects  hobbies they are just like the larger foam sanding blocks that you can get at lowes or home depot but much smaller 375 x 1  so you can have very granular control however be warned they are pretty abrasive 60 grit on one side  100 on the other so not for fine sanding overall a great deal for this large pack of sanding blocks
best spray wax on the market by a longshot the durability of other spray on rinse off products doesnt even compare to this product have had this last 6 months after properly clay barring a vehicle perfect for wheels as well
water is so important for much health reasons the flavor is very concentrated so only 12 of dropper is needed in 810 ox of waterthis brand of flavors is delicious and pure my favorite is the coconut flavor and the pineapplecoconut

love the bleach tablets though expensive for only 40 they have helped with my asthma i cant breathe in the bleach fumes and this is a way of preventing it and they are easy to use and work
the carpet in my town home is 13 years old so it has seen better days it wasnt even new when i moved in and the management doesnt offer carpet cleaning anymore the old one did they also dont replace the carpets either unless you move outso naturally i want something to refreshand with all the bad things out there trying to find a nice good refreshener is a choreseeing this i thought  why not and i found out why notthe package is atrocious the product despite having a seal sprinkled out the seal wasnt easy to remove and more product flies outlets talk about scent  if you have a problem with strong scents  stay awaysince it is just my mother and i in the household we have no small kids or pets  we sprinkled this on the carpetit says to wait 15 minutes now we only sprinkled a small area but after 5 minutes we had to get rid of it so we vacuumed it upthat made it worse omg it smelled like old tuna cans and peppermint grosseffective i cannot believe any germ would stay around with this it did lighten the carpet but i had to toss the rest of this due to the scentit is definitely not worth the 999 it is currently listed as it isnt something i would get again or recommendnow i need to find out how to get the stench out

it cute the very clean very sharp
i cant blow out a candle through this mask so theyre decent for filtering theyre comfortable on my large head they stand off my face well so theyre comfortable even in the florida heat for long term wearing the nose bar blocks off enough air that i can get a fair seal and not too much fogging of my glasses plus i like the black better than white or blue ive worn several so far and not one has failed would recommend
had a glass shower and it works well to remove water from walls
these are great  i bought the unflavored balms and they have a perfectly natural neutral smell to them and zero taste  they keep my lips from getting chapped and go on smoothly  i would buy these again
i feel like this is the perfect contour pillow because it lowers your heads and provide perfect support to your neck i love the design of it i wake up feeling alot more active while using this pillow the only bad thing about this pillow is it has a very strong chemical smell it wont go away for a good 24 hours i would highly recommend if you order this particular pillow please dont sleep on the night it arrive let it air out for at least 2 dayshope this helps
not what i expected lining too light for me maybe for a jogger its fine but offers no no protection
i like this small dustpan and brush set and prefer to use it for our dining room table and my desk it helps remove the different crumbs or eraser bits more effectively than using a brush or sponge or my hand  it also is small enough to keep in a desk drawer and encourages me to tidy up
was not impressed with using this wasnt able to scrub things and have it remove the food
this is my favoite organic barley grass on the market its fresher its felt in a smoothie immediately its easy to use and its detoxing add some dulse while youre at it dulse flakes are cheap a banana 2 cups organic blueberries  3 oranges or 3 cups organic orange juice oh yum compliments of medical medium
this was a great party pack and a very good value for the money  would certainly order again for next year
this gel is terrific i inadvertently got a serious sunburn on my back i was at an outdoor function the sun must have been stronger than i realized because it penetrated my shirt probably the worst burn ive ever gotten this provided almost immediate relief the aloe is soothing and healing the menthol is cooling it does have a strong minty fragrance almost like a supercharged mouthwash i wish it was either unscented or lighter but the bottom line is it provides pain relief quickly and stimulates healing great stuff
comfortable and easy care
they work okay but my ear canals are super sensitive to the pressure which makes them hard to wear during sleep which is why i bought him
my cousin told me about this since my wife is taking miralax via drs orders to help her she started these about 2 weeks ago dropped the miralax and the results are great seems to be all natural she had to cut it down to half because it was working too well so far she is very happy with it other than the taste if you like figs and dates its a bit like that taste maybe little more sour and it sticks to your teeth she takes it at supper and has fruit or dessert after ti cover the taste ive tried it and do not really mind the taste other that it definitely sticks to your teeth if youre having going to the bathroom issues its definitely worth a try
these make great gifts for the jewelry lover who loves to travel
leaves pattern on food tears too easy
this oil smells like perfume it is a fragrance oil or blend not an essential oil theres no such thing as vanilla essential oil and there is no evidence whatsoever that this is any type of certified organic anything real organic actual essential oils have to be certified in the world of vanilla there are vanilla absolutes vanilla extract vanilla flavoring and vanilla fragrance oils or blends please do your research before purchasing this product this is a vanilla fragrance oil or blend that is not meant to go into a diffuser the price is also an indicator that this is not a true vanilla absolute which is what would be used in a diffuser or in soaps vanilla absolutes are expensive these are cheap and they smell cheap they do not smell anything like vanilla at all they smell like perfume not a good perfume and not a vanilla perfume i would not recommend whatever kind of oils these are at all
a little expensive but very good
this has been doing a great job at keeping my toilets clean my only complaint is that it has a bromine smell to it which reminds me of a public restroom at a swimming pool not a bad smell but definitely noticeable the time savings is worth it to me nothing an air freshener cant mask anyway
i do a lot of research before buying or trying products and its been a while since ive had a product that made me so happy  i think this is a great value productwhen i first started working with a personal trainer a few years ago one of the first things he made me buy was a foam roller34why34  i asked34so you can work out knots in your muscles  trust me youll want it34so i ordered one of those giant long big blue foam rollers that they have in gyms  it was cumbersome but it was effective  i didnt realize how tight my muscles were until i rolled on these rollers and let the weight of my body press against the roller  it was so good but so painful  and as much as i liked using it i hated storing it  i was living in a loft at the time and that thing was really unsightlythen i saw this 3 in 1 roller and was really excited to try it  the 3 in 1 roller has basically 3 rollers that stack neatly inside one another  theres the outer roller most similar to what i had before a gear shaped roller for more targeted pressure points and a rolling massage stick  its shorter but im still able to fit both legs on the roller  it also cost the same as my giant long blue tube roller  i like that its compact enough to hide from sight when not in use  i like the firmness of the large roller and small roller and the whole kit feels very sturdy and well constructed  the only slightly annoying thing is that the massage stick fits very snug into the gear roller so it takes a lot of effort to pull out and i worry whether the handle might break over time  better that than too loose and constantly falling out i guessfoam rolling works based on the idea that pressure applied to certain body parts helps to work out knots and relieve pain  until i started using foam rollers i didnt realize how many knots i had in my body  i do stretches regularly but you still dont get it all outthere are a number of great roller positions you can use  the ones i find most effective are for my quads and hamstring  you prop your roller onto your hamstrings or quads and hold a low plank with the weight centred over the roller  hold position for a few seconds at a time where you feel pain  discomfort and slowly roll up and down every part of your legs  the same concept works with calves and glutes  just roll slowly onto the roller putting as much weight as you can on the point of contact between the roller and your bodymy back and neck are often sore so ill lie on my back with the large roller tucked under my lower back and then arch backwards  with the gear roller i like propping it under my neck and pushing down on the pain pressure points  ive also run the massage stick up and down sore spots on my neck and along my shouldersoverall there are lots of uses and plenty of exercises you can look up online  its a great way to work out muscle knots and relieve soreness and tightness from exercise  it also loosens your muscles and prevents tearing  i received a review sample of this roller for my honest opinion and i wouldnt hesitate to purchase another if i were to misplace this one
grainy does not dissolve  its like sand in the bottom of a cup
just like the product from so many years ago great
srsly  im sure the buckets would be great if they were useable find a local dealer so this doesnt happen to you
i couldnt get this to spray nicely it started to spray in a stream not a mist
it works well and its aroma is for me quite pleasant follow the directions and your shoes will revive at least mine did
no complaints and no smell
as a fulltime caregiver of a person suffering the symptoms of alzheimers ive been struggling with finding good products for her dual incontinence issues  after finding a great adult diaper that holds her through the night weve noticed that the diapers have an unpleasant smell to them worth a bit of odor if i dont have to do laundry of the complete bedding 12x per day  my sister works as a medical assistant and she told me that this is what all the medical assistants keep at their desks to eliminate odors whenever an exam room needs it  i ordered this product as well as another one by a different manufacturer  hands down this is the far superiior product same as used at the hospital  while they both worked on the odor this one only takes 12 sprays in the room and the odors disappear and the best part is the small fragrance you smell once you spray goes away and it just smells fresh  i cannot recommend this product enough
my boy donut couldnt go a day without ferretone every ferret loves it
i like the price 62
i am so disappointed when i opened the package i saw these cute little purple sachets i wanted to put them in drawers and in my closet they are just that a cute sachet there is no scent whatsoever absolutely none
the ingredients in this tend to be difficult to notice as the effects arent really immediate but over time they are noticeable and offer a fantastic boost cordyceps has many benefits along with lions mane i really enjoy the full assortment in this blend and have made sure its added to my continuous use list of supplements
these are great although for tight spaces they will break off in your teeth and you have to be adventurous to get them out but otherwise they do the job they are intended to do
the brush fits perfect on my clarisonic the main reason i bought the brushes however i noticed a very strong stench coming from the brush after about 3 washes very disappointed i guess you do pay for what you get
very big bigger than i thought it does hold a lot of oils but some of my bottles are bigger than doterra so the bigger bottles take up more space and the next area is not available therefore cutting down on the number of oils in the case i am also curious how the foam holds up or breaks down when oils get on it is there a replacement for the foam insert the case is sturdy and i appreciate the handle makes it a lot easier than the cardboard box i had them in
not a bad pillow worth a try
this is a really nice size balloon  we didnt have any helium handy so we just filled it with air  inflates easy and held the air overnight so no issues there  great for kids birthday parties  i checked with a local store and they will fill the balloon for use for a nominal charge they said 199 same as if we bought the balloon at the store  great fun balloon
the item fit way too big and the item could not be returned to seller one hot mess

there are four black lanyards in this package the loop is too small to get my head through if i extend the pushbutton adjuster to the very end so that there is no loop meaning the inclusion of the mask on the ends will create the loop it is still too small also i cannot get any of the clasps to open to attach the masks i squeezed and squeezed and they barely budged this is complete garbage and that is where i put thisin the trash
it works
i dont know why people were complaining about set up i set my scale on a hard floor and it took me all of 10 seconds to connect it and then it told me to weigh myself it was absolutely easythe sleek design is so attractive the bottom of the scale is covered in a bubble look and it really does look futuristic this connected nicely to my fitbit and my fitness pal infact i weighed myself and it auto uploaded without me touching a button so that was niceim really glad i invested the money for this scale it seems to be accurate seeing as how i was just weighed at the doctors office 1 week ago and have lost a few lbs off that number which i am trying to do so as far as accuracy goes this seems to be right on keyi need to keep it hidden from my kids though because it says not to be used by anyone under 10 and the look is just too temptingthe display is nice it recognizes you by the account you set up and calls you by your initials you can also set up multiple users i am really happy with this purchase  so far update may 6 2014  got on the scale this morning and it read one weight  which i thought was impossible  so i got back on  it was 4 lbs down  huh  got on again 2 lbs up  got on again  12 lbs down  this scale is messed up and i am returning it  i know my body fluctuates but not like this and not in a 5 min time frame  the scale integrates nicely with mfp but make sure you watch it for inconsistencies mine is a white one  and i originally really liked it  however ive weighed myself only a handful of times since i got it and it fluctuates like mad
nice to have the different sizes it does crumble a pill with a heavy coating but you cant stop that the blade could be a little stronger
buy it great natural energy
i own and have been using straight razors for years i figured i would try a shavette for those times when i dont feel or have the time to strop or touch up the edge on the standard straight edge i bought two of them to see which one i would like both are the 34push type34this one is all coated metal and is heavier than my standard straights even heavier than my spartacus str8s but the main reason i am writing this review is how even the blade sits in this unit with this unit the blade fits perfectly even in the holder the heavier metal really holds the blade in place beautifully tight and perfectly exposed the other shavette i got was the cut throat with a multi colored wood handle from ebay for 15the handle was nice but the blade holder metal was quite a bit thinner and the edge of the blade was not evenly exposed that is because the two metal edges where the blade comes through are not even one edge is higher than the other and not parallel from one side to the other as the metal is thin i tried to bend the two edges so they would line up better no luck once metal is bent it is hardened summary this matte slide out is a higher quality unit with quality control that is necessary for the blade to be exposed evenly  fun to shave with and convenient
i bought these to wear when i take my contacts out  fyi they are a little wide  i am a girl and i think they are meant for big headed boys    all the same i love the style  just wish they were a little bit tighter at the temples  the appear to be good quality and i dont see any distortion in the lens
this beet root powder smells like dirt and the taste is very strong and not good  ive tried mixing it with other flavors but havent been able to mask the bad flavor  further  even though ive ingested it anyway  ive noticed no results as far as increased energy or anything else  will not purchase this ever again
received it the other day  wore it last night so many problems with it i have very sensitive skin  particularly the chin section created a rash on my chin  no matter what i did it would slip up over my mouth the openings for the ears were not even close to where my ears are it did keep my mouth closed because the chin material kept covering it but there was nothing there that i can rave about  waste of money  is now in the trash
great price for so many i love dreft use it on regular clothes not just the babies stuff it literally gets out most stains we have from wine to spaghetti sauce and everything kids can get into in between like slime and dirt
these storage containers are smaller than i expected but they still work well for bringing food to work or school in a lunch bag they work well for salads pasta rice and small quantities of other leftovers the lids fit securely but go on and off easily the containers are easy to clean since they are dishwasher safe on the top shelf this item comes with a total of thirty containers in six sets of five
great quality
i bought this for my granddaughter and my daughter gets stopped all the time asked where she got it  i fits her well and she looks darling in it
in theory i love this product however it really didnt work that well maybe its cuz i wear makeup but i feel like half the world words make up
bone marrow is a very good source of nutrition that most people no longer get me included  i didnt even know about the health benefits of bone marrow until a few short months ago  when i saw this supplement available for review i wanted to try it  i think its very good and very high quality  i just cant deal with taking 4 capsule of it each day  i will have to bust them open and pour the contents into soups or something  i have other forms of bone marrow supplements that i like better such as a thick gravy kind that is already seasoned and all i have to do is spoon it into a casserole meatloaf soup etc and stir it in before cooking it  and i have a bone marrow supplement thats chocolate flavored that i can mix up in a smoothie  all are good forms and if you have no trouble swallowing pills or capsules i think this would be a great choice
i was trying to find a basic sticker to put on my granddaughters books to say who they were from and when i do not know what i was thinking buying these they would be awesome for a invitation or something like that too fancy and pricey for a label my fault
product well described by seller construction is sound with no nails protruding hinge works well this essential oil box is exactly what i needed to house my eo bottles ranging from 5 to 15 ml would recommend the purchase of this box to a friend
not as good as extra strength thoughi normally use the extra strengthand after taking thesei did notice they were not as good
best bug repellent especially great on sensitive skin with a pleasant oder
not the beat quality they were different sizes and thickness
great protein bars great flavor
run smaller than ad photo but works
the first issue was that the soap didnt come out of the wand easily solved by poking a larger hole in the soap wand using a paring knife second issue was that even after creating a larger opening for soap to come out the sponge was too thickdense for the soap to saturate sufficiently again an easy fix  i simply used my paring knife to make a small slit in the center of the sponge at this point despite having to make these minor adjustments i was still ok with the product because hey this scrubber is always in my sink and i always have a knife that needs cleaning so despite the fact that a product should perform as intended without the need for alterations the literal 5second investment was worth it in a world where scotchbrite refills have apparently gone the way of the dodo but i digress the real issue  and this one is insurmountable  is that the flipping sponge pops off of the little bracket that attaches it to the wandeverysingletime honestly i hate stinky sponges that sit in and around sinks so much that i actually thought about purchasing some sort of waterproof glue to reattach the sponges to the bracketsbut i mean cmon anyway total pass on this one
perfect for what i needed great price as well  i even ordered a second one after receiving the first one  pill cutter and grinder are very easy to use  and the travel case is perfect for keeping extra meds i may need in my car
this gave me a swollen eye and ridiculous lashes that curled on themselves all the way back to my eyelidthe sticky rods tore my skin open there was a little piece of my skin stuck to the rod and a hole on my eyelid wtf removing the super sticky rods caused my lids to bruise all along the lashlinethen my eye swelled up either because of the trauma or because of product getting into the wound either way bad newseyes are delicate dont mess with thisno ingredients listed no brand to complain to this is imported from china with no consumer safety guarantees
i was very pleased with my order  i ordered this for a friend  my friend really liked the poster  my order arrived in a timely manner
the taste is good the ingredients are healthy and ketofriendly other than sucralose i have consumed bulletproof coffee regularly for years so i am used to this type of coffee one issue is the price which is currently 350 per cup if you have four cups per day that is 14 per day and this pack will only last five days you can make coffee at home add your own butter mct oil and collagen at a cost of 040  1 per cup where this product makes sense is when you are away from home such as in the office or while traveling for that use case this product is good spending 350 on a cup of coffee is too much thoughthe other issue is that this product is not ketofriendly since it has sucralose which will spike insulin the amount of sucralose in this is not disclosed
description was worded unclear product is of good quality and im assuming if i was pregnant would be helpful but for my situation was not applicable
wow cleaned my bbq so beautifully plus my two wood stoves and the bricks around them
this smells almost rotten like something in it has gone bad  i couldnt stand the smell so i threw it away and got a different brand
i thought maybe i goofed and these insoles were for a childs shoe  they are so narrow and smalli put my heel in and the front part barely comes to the ball of my foot  and so narrow that the edges are uncomfortable on the sides of my feetnot worth the effort to even peel and stick them into my shoe
this is a great pill container i have one and purchased another for a friend the look is very classy and great to throw in the suitcase or purse when traveling
love these  i am a nurse and my arms get cold but i am too hot with a full shirt  these r perfect  look really nice and well made  highly recommended
it is a strong astringent so is great for oral health tightening gums i dilute three drops in a teaspoon of water to swish and then dab a little on my deepest wrinkles it is reducing them a lot how funny it looks like blood and would stain but outside the dumb name it is great stuff
the jar is neutral in color and attractive but the best thing about it is that i dont have to strike repeatedly to get the matches to light the stickon paper is a surprisingly effective striking surface
great stuff for all stomach issues  works great on dogs as well healed my bulldogs stomach
i like using the heart rate monitor thats the only thing i liked its kinda bulky and only has time in military form the app sucks i didnt understand a thing on it just the settings that was the main reason why i didnt like it so i decided to just buy the new fitbit ulta im still keeping the morefit though because of the heart rate
glucosamine from viva labs is an excellent product with triple strength i am so happy i got this product at an excellent price of 299 and free shipping it is unbeatable try it and you will experience the difference
works well easy to setup very accurate use it with hoyer lift and sling to weigh wheelchair bound person that cant stand on a normal scale
i really really love it perfect  size and i love the color
discreet packaging padded envelope that makes it appear as toolsheads up if it gets hard to blow through its from overuse and it just needs to dry off
when i first got this gel i thought that there was no way it was going to work but it does and it is a large tube so you get your moneys worth i have spinal stenosis and the weather is changing which means that i have more pain than normal but this gel has eased my joint pain i recommend to everyone who suffers from arthritis joint pain stenosis or even fibromyalgia  i received this item either free or greatly discounted since i am a nation wide product tester and my testimony is true and unbiased
what i like about this gauze is that is is soft stretchy and goes on without much fuss unlike standard gauze which is not soft not stretchy and falls off while you are trying to wrap it and you cuss a lot as your wounds weep or worse bleed and you have to start all over again and then you just sit in a pile of crappy gauze crying in frustrationbut not this gauzealso very nicely priced
i should have read more reviews they dont come with instructions or ingredients or anything and look like someone took a larger pack and separated it into smaller ones manually previously wed gotten some from our dentist and the instructions were to chew one tablet she did  and it was terrible the taste almost made her throw up and then it stained her lips teeth tongue and our sink copious amounts of dye i did wash out the sink with soap eventually but i had to brush her teeth quite a bit to get the purple off and her tongue is still purple and she has purple spots on her face im now worried about an allergic reaction after reading the review where the child had breathing problems ill be watching her carefully tonight they did disclose plaque but for our needs they wont work 7 wasted very disappointed
i cannot use it its crammed into the case it came in and cannot be removed broke carry case to get i out i bought this for the carry casethe file is nice just the case is the issue
these gloves do exactly what theyre made to do protect your hands from dirt grime and water the gloves are comfortable however just a tad too big i have long fingers so the length is perfect but they are a little baggy no worries they still work well for washing dishes and general cleaning around the house be sure to note that only the teal gloves are flocked and the pink and white gloves are not im fine with either but that may cause an issue to others
back support
i like them so much that i got some for my kids and signif other  found that i really only need one per day though  great product
definitely dont drink it straight from the bottle burned my throat and it was sore for three days
i recently broke my left fibula and bought this to be able to put my shoes on and its one of the best amazon purchases i ever made i love how it is adjustable and it works perfectly then i twisted my right knee and had to get this back out now i keep it on a hook in a designated place because its that valuable to me now
do not play fetch with this as i can see it getting lodged in your dogs throat if caught wrongmy pups seem to enjoy chewing on this i have medium sized dogs they did however chew off a very small piece of this productmaking me reduce the stars any dig chew where the dog can easily chew off the product is not good as the dog will swallow it
just as pictured good quality
these lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck but they can only be hooked onto masks that have a very thin elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end the cord is sufficiently long and can be cinched tighter or looser around the neck if needed i felt it was roomy enough cinched partway downthe chains are colorful and work well the current price of 599 is excellent for this as it comes to 120 per lanyard i really like fun color of these chains however my absolute favorite mask chain is  which is more than 12 times the price but is also an eyeglass chain jewelry and a mask holder
i bought these for my daughter and her family i put their names in between the designs and it turned out so cute my son in law 2 granddaughters and my daughter wore their christmas hats all day on christmas day they loved them they are so different from the usual red christmas hats with the white trimming i had bought them another set but they liked these better i bought the lettering from amazon too so cute wish i knew how to take and photo and download to the section to add photos
this is something i have been adding to my smoothies and in that situation the flavor works fine i dont like the taste well enough to just mix with milk but in my vanilla yogurt frozen blackberries splash of apple juice smoothies it is just fineas far as pain relief i havent noticed any at all i have an autoimmune arthritis which the reason i tried this but havent had any reduction in pain this probably takes time to work like glucosamine does i intend to keep using it and will update
great bottles
this is much bigger than i thought it would be  it has held up pretty well
i love the colors and that we can store 4 batteries in each case and we can also attach them together i think this is a great buy if you need to take batteries with you or simply store them organized
i found method foaming body wash 2 years ago when i broke my wrist i had to use a plastic sleeve to shower and it was difficult to handle a bar of soap and washcloth with the other hand i read a suggestion about body wash and i found this in the grocery market the one i found was the green one and i really loved it  i cant find it anywhere now but found this orange one here on amazon the green was sold out but the orange was available i was happy to grab a couple of them because i dont know if or when ill see them again its really nice stuff
these worked great sturdy and inexpensive
ive only been taking these for a few days now  i have noticed that im not doing my usual afternoon snacking  just dont want anything in the afternoon anymorei do eat a light breakfast before i take the pillsit did take about 2 days before i started noticing my hunger going down a bitif you can easily swallow pills then youll have no problem with these  if you have a gag reflex then these might be a little problem  pills are a little bit in my opinionwill try to do an update in a month
i ordered several of these in different colors for review including the one in  and they are all junk and stick in place all had to be thrown outthis black one is as terrible a pill case as the other colors the door is difficult to open and the chamber was stuck on saturday and a half i cannot even use this not to mention if i could i would not be able to see the pills i threw this out avoid like the plague
sized for children or smaller adults durable for the price
these earplugs recommended by the wirecutter have a lot of potential  the design is functional and ascetically pleasing and there are several sizing options in both the rubber and foam tips which is great  im still working through the options to figure out what size is the best fit for my ears and i havent landed on the perfect solution yet but hopefully with all of the available options i should be able to find the right fit  given the variety im sure most people would be able to find an option that works well for their ears which is one of the nice benefits of this product over many of the competing options
this tens unit is by far the best i have terrible chronic pain and not much at all has helped me this helps me relax so much and gives me relief thank you so much for making this product i highly recommend it if you are looking for great quality and pain relief then this is your device
not just for kids i love these wont wipe my ass without them they are fragrance free and not harsh at all never have a problem with them flushing
these are too big to provide any compression ive also tried sbsox copper compression and roxofit all ordered based on their individual sizing recommendations for my 8 arches these by far fit the largest in size small they are designed more like the sbsox style which is longer and extends the length of the metatarsal region this is good for people with longer feet but these have a thick seem that looks like it would be uncomfortable too i ordered these because they came in flesh tone and had to return the copper compression flesh tone ones due to poor construction quality but i can not recommend these and they are going back immediately without me even trying to wear them to see if they are supportive
the locking mechanism gave way after first trip without it its just an expensive plastic bag i will not buy this again
very heavy i wouldnt wear these out of the house until i am able to keep them in for sure
very good price looks great  the round shape is of good size  vision is clear glasses look durable
this cavalier matches the one i have in real life  holds my glasses so i can find them easily its a good weight too it really is a cute art piece
packaged well great item for the price  arrived promptly
not bad but is slightly too low for me in lateral position the customer support seems helpful though and suggested to try two pillows on top of each other i will give it a try
use this in my bubble bars and it works great
the gel is really refreshing
i purchased these for the charcoal bristle brushes i received the package there are white bristle brushes and charcoal bristle brushes in the package they all have different letters but they dont tell you if the letters stand for the different softness levels of the brushes or what they represent the brushes loose their bristles after about the first 10 brushes so theyre definitely disposable i am keeping them for guests to use but not what i was hoping for
the smell is a bit weird however i am so fond of the fact that it is a silky lotion consistency and not a nasty stinging oil  this product is great but you may wish to wash your hands after using it  or add a medicinal therapeutic grade quality organic essential oil fragrance to it in order to mask the scent  over all though i highly recommend the product it works fast
i like these containers and they did not leak when i filled them with my hippy sunblock brew  however only four stars because this set doesnt really screw back down
i didnt like the taste of this at all and ended up giving it away
nice on nose
i found these in my local grocers used them and fell in love i understand the negative reviews since in todays society faster and simpler is deemed better but i believe in working at least a little harder if you want the best results in any area of our lives the glue flap requires attention and care to close it properly and the results are excellent i just bought out one supplier here at amazon and ill be looking for more i love this quickasteam product and i thank the inventors and manufacturers who have made my dinnertimes much faster safer and more delicious
ive been watching a lot of kdramas lately and the characters often take these supplements in small pouches  i was interested in trying this calcium jelly supplement  the calcium supplement is expensive at around 2 per pouch but it is much tastier than the large calcium pills that i normally take  the supplement is a mix of jelly and fruit leather texture and has a sweet pomegranate taste  the supplement doesnt have sugar or water but it has a nice light burnt sugarcaramel and pomegranate taste
dont be afraid to switch hands if one eyes application gives you more trouble than the other

i wore these to work hoping they would provide my left ankle with the bracing it needs as i suffer from an old tendon tear that flares up when i do a great deal of walking andor when the weather is extremely hot or if there is a quick shift in the weather  i tore the tendon that runs along the outside of my left foot  and when i say tore i literally heard a crack when it tore  it was so loud and such a crisp sound i thought id broken a bone  anyway it took a very long time to heal and because it is a tendon it did not heal back the same as new  it hurts and feels as if it could give way when the weather is muggy hot and when ive walked quite a bit  i mention this because thats why i ordered this brace for my left ankle  and again i wore these to work and while they are like wearing compression socks which are better than nothing on my foot they have to bracing effect  i even had kinseology tape wrapped around that ankle as well  ah well  short compression socks with my toes free are fine
most ultra healthy foodstuffs do not taste good this powder is ok mainly because it blends in with whatever you choose to mix it with like tofu it is bland on its own but its fairly tasty when mixed with something else i appreciate the fact that its organic and nongmo but this is one of these superfood powders that best benefit those who dont eat enough fruits and vegetables i do so i dont feel im missing that much by not ingesting something with noni fruit in it its ok but i wouldnt order it again
and this wonderful stuff prevents rashes sores redness from her diaper undies i love that it has no petrol chemicals or other toxic garbage i thank god for the honest company
these are well flavored drops  i used it for vape juice flavoring and my husband enjoyed the flavor and had no complaints
i had high hopes for this product but alas i was dissatisfied i found it necessary to reapply the product every 4560 minutes i would not repurchase this product
this hibiclens hand pump took a ridiculously long time to arrive and the straw does not reach the bottom of the bottle while i was waiting for this to arrive i purchased two clear  pump dispenser bottles which arrived the following day they take up less space than a 32oz bottle cost less and are a more attractive option save your money
i nice love them
this has a very weird taste i like the chocolate and vanilla the company itself was great
seller is advertising product as easy to swallow they are not these capsules are almost an inch long and about 125 inches in circumference they are among the largest if not the largest capsules i have come across so i measured them many older people have trouble swallowing and these could very well be dangerous for them i have a smallish throat so i bought these believing the 34easy to swallow34 advertising which i find deceiving will not purchase again
marine collagen was better for me
i chose this because it is a dk combo and encapsulated in fat here is why   k helps you absorb the d and both d  k are fat soluble vitamins  for about a year now we have been using dk combos in our bulletproof coffee in the morning more fat for absorption  both my husband and i have had our d checked and we are both slightly over 100  with the present climate one wants to be over 75  if one has an autoimmune one wants to be as close to 100 without going over  when i first started last year i was tested at 41  which is normal but not high enough for certain things  that was considering i already took a standard d supplement and we were very much outdoorsy people  most people just do not not realize they are deficientso  all that said  i appreciate this product  we still use it in our coffee  it seems to work well and keeps out levels where we need  we have gotten our d checked about every 6 months  no regrets here
fantastic product  i have never had anything work faster or better
very good shisha first time trying fantasia love it especially the rainbow flavor
ive been through several nebulizers now this is the best so farcompletely silent works greati love it
i was looking a pair of calf compression sleeves for my running sessions and these ones are great id buy them again
this set of dental tools comes in a metal case and includes six different tools four of the six are scraping or pick tools one is a mirror and the other a large tweezers im not a dentist or hygienist and honestly i have no idea what to do with several of these tools including the tweezers but the scraping tools work very well for my intended purpose which is to clean my teeth between dentist visits i dont like the feel of plaque and tartar building up on my lower front teeth and with these tools i can gently remove some of it to keep my teeth feeling clean and healthy the tools are weighty made of quality stainless steel and for a nonprofessional like me are perfect especially given the low price
my dentist introduced me to this line of products some years back and i had been using the mouthwash and the oral irrigation rinse for use with my water pic ever since then but had never tried the breath spray or the toothpaste i also recently went on a vacation where i was not able to bring my mouthwash and i had really missed itthis was a wonderful way to get introduced to the other products in the line that i hadnt yet tried and to have some travel products available for the next time i go on vacation so that i dont have to do withoutthe packaging is excellent and seems very sturdy yet its easy to get into when i want to use and i really like the breath spray which seems to actually neutralize issues rather than just cover them up with a squirt of mint
dont go without it
this stuff works great on left on forever grease messes by the stove
i used crest for many many years  i was getting tired of it even though it is just toothpaste  i switched to colgate a few years ago and i find the taste is pleasant  the only issue is i think the tubes have really shrunk throughout the years
i bought this because i have arthritis in my right thumb and it hurts to use a regular fingernail clipper  i can effortlessly cup my nails  its such a relief  the only thing i didnt like is the size of the cutting mechanism  its a little large  its better suited  for clipping toenails than fingernails
i ordered this for my grandpa who moves around the house in his wheelchair this was great for transition in floor from hallway to kitchen as he had trouble moving on the threshold we liked it so much we are ordering another one for another area in the house
i used the whole bottle and didnt notice any change
i have owned many different pill cutters over the years and this is the best one ive ever used by far it is constructed of medicalgrade bpafree plastic and its stainlesssteel blade is thin and sharp this allows it to cut pills in half without turning them into crumbs and dust which happens all too often when such blades are too wide and too dullit is typical for pill cutters to have a vshape for holding pills of various sizes in place so that is not in itself a unique feature however what is a new feature to me at least is that this pill cutter provides a highly visible painted line running down the center of the v space this mark allows the user to accurately position pills which contain an indented break line in their center such that this break line is in alignment with the cutters blade this makes it additionally likely that this particular type of pill will be split cleanly in half with no wasted crumbsthis pill cutter is conveniently larger than any other pill cutter ive owned which are usually about 1inch x 25inch in size this one is 15inch x 35inch making it easier to handle for anyone who suffers from arthritisfinally as an extra little plus this handy device is surprisingly attractive due to its sleek design and the fact that it is a pleasing aqua colorall in all i find this to be an excellent product that i would not hesitate to recommend to family or friends
i got this for my toddler who sometimes have a hard time to self sooth  at bedtime this ball has a vibrating  press button that is removable it uses a battery it doesnt  come with one thou my baby is not fond of the vibration so i took it out we have been using it and he has been doing excellent  at bedtime i like iti will suggest  removing  the vibrating  button if you are not using it because  its heavy and if you have more than one kid using it as a play throw ball you dont want the vibrating  button  hitting  your kids its painful
anyone doing cancer therapy should drink this seriously check out their site online
did not fit the pedegg model i have the value and quality was great but sadly i had to return them
works okcould get the same product for cheaper price
this gat to be one of my favorites product for babies its easy to use and definitely gets the nasal passages open for baby i recommend it
i remembered this alcohol scent from when i was a kid our home was filled with extra stuff too much to fit in a medicine cabinet so this was on the 3 tier shelf just outside the bathroom this was a different alcohol with a great scent years later i found it again in a beauty supply store and still loved it and used it like i did regular alcohol id also apply to my underarms instead of deodorant when id be home to help keep me smelling fresh and feeling cool
just what i wanted
i purchased this as a gift for my daughtershe loves it and says it works great
maybe its just me but this makes a thick layer on the nails in one respect its good because i dont have to soak it off instead it peals off in one piece and doesnt last more than a day or two but since im not paying 6000 a pop to do my own nails i cant really complain you get what you pay for
this cushion is great and is made out of the same great material developed by purple for their purple bed i recommend their cushion as much as i recommend their bedthis cushion measures 1834x1634 it is perfect for smaller chairs in the kitchen or smaller computer chairs i personally am using mine in my car dodge durango for comfort i find that is is quite comfortable but i wish it was a little bit bigger i would recommend if you are using this for a bigger computer chair or vehicle seat get the cushion that is the next size up which would be the ultimate purple cushiondimensions are 1834x1634x234 inside of the included washable coverprosreally comfortable for 48 hours of sittingdoesnt smellincluded coverconskind of small made more for smaller chairs 12 a staradditional considerationstake a look at the purple bed and the other cushions they are great they also have a new kickstarter out for their purple pillow which i expect will also be greatoverall 455 stars 625 rounds up 605 rounds down 62 5 starsif you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and i will get back to you as soon as possible
these are made for the dallas cowboy fan but the star logo is a pretty design for a ziploc bag even if youre not a fan ziploc bags are so versatile  i use these to take snacks to work for freezing leftovers and as a disposable shake and bake bag just fill one with breadcrumbs and dump your eggsoaked pork chop or chicken leg shake then put the meat in the oven each bag is easy to seal and its hard to tear  the bags are neither too thick nor too thin which makes them ideal for storing food items overall im happy with it
this is very similar to every other collagen powder i have tried but it does have a hard time mixing in
easier to put on once on your feet get so hot i couldnt tolerate then and had to take them off a couple hours after putting them on
by far out of so many masks ive purchased the best mask ever i dont have an exceptionally large face but most others aside from the paper masks leaves my double chin  so obvious this tucks under goes high has the metal piece for the bridge of the nose and allows you to unfold as much or little as you want expensive but so worth it
ive bought others but this one fits hand better when applying vs those that feel like they are size of baseball mitt
took it once and made me very sick yuck and no returns
they work awesome doesnt pull on your nose hairs like some trimmers
great bath pillow never had any issues with suction cups like with previous pillows  its lasted for a few years and still going strong
i purchased 4 of these from amazon after i purchased one for our 4 month old at a boutique and our big kids fell in love with them and begged me to get them each one we have the pink purple tealgreen tealblue and the orangeyellow they are all so cute and feel so good also they work great for cradle cap
very little product not worth what i paid
i know pure coconut milk tends to clump but i would rather have clumping than have other ingredients included to prevent clumping my body doesnt like the starches added it adulterates the taste as well
i used it once and it worked fine i stored it outside in a storage bench and the next time i pulled it out the dustpan was completely warped and no longer usable what a waste it was brand new
no batteries to worry about
love these elderberry gummies whatever i can do to help my immune system during this pandemic is a plus the taste is pleasant vegetarian and gmo free is also a plus
too super long for it to arrive  i guess because it came directly from china  the case itself is ok  its not a solid hard case  it has the strength of lets say a shoe box that has been covered with material
keeping screens glasses and face shields is a never ending chorethese wipes do a through job without leaving streaks or filmso nice not to have to go back and try to polish again
very nice little organizer a bit bigger than i needed since i dont wear a lot of jewelry but will help me make sure my jewelry doesnt get lost in the bottom of my bag when i travel
this stuff is hot folks we were used to the regular green stuff and the max freeze this promixhas a lot of menthol in it my physical therapist recommended cutting it with some good lotion we did and it works great you can make 2 tubes out of one if you can stand it right out of the tube you are much tougher than we are lol
hard to tell if its actually working but from ask appearances its keeping my bathroom air clean of germs and mold spores it at least does a decent job of eliminating odors i think and its a comforting presence to know its always whirring away
great product for the price works great
tonight i will be using it again before i go to bed the very first time i used it i could hear my neck crackalackin i have such bad neck issues that i get bad headaches and dizziness i am hoping this solves both issues otherwise i will need to go to the doctor on the dizziness issue
these are a great option if youre a paleo fan and trying to eat only whole and natural foods are they like a candy bar like most 34healthy34 protein barsno definitely not and this wouldnt be for you i find the flavor good they satisfy my hunger for a few hours and they are great to have on hand for when you need a high protein snack and need something quick as they suggest you really should put them in the microwave for 10 secs before eating that makes all the difference they are a bit greasy when you first open the package which is a little odd to me but i just overlook it and dig in the texture is pretty hard unless you heat them up a bit the chocolate was my favorite but all 3 flavors are good the mint is pretty minty so if youre not a fan you likely wont enjoy it
been using these for all three of my kids for months now definitely recommend great product and super fast shipping
great scale but must be on a hard floor
love this product mixes easily and taste great  metabogreens is powerpacked with fruitsveggies spicesherbs and gives me the energy i thought id lostthanks biotrust
great product and quality purchased as gift they loved them love the colored tips
these jspa non binding socks are very soft and have no rough seams i have a neurovascular problem that causes pain and swelling in my feet and legs wearing regular socks often makes my feet hot causing the issue to worsen they are nice and thick and feel very cushy but dont make my feet sweat ive found that bamboo is much kinder and more breathable than cotton these socks dont cause indentations on my legs and feet after wearing them and being on my feet for several hours they are well made good quality socks and are as they claim i would definitely recommend them
normally i dislike anything that has a strong odor whether it be detergent fabric softener or dryer sheets  but these have a different sort of fragrance to them which isnt all that offensive and theyve left my clothing with a fragrance that isnt strong  i would buy these again
oil of oregano is a very potent antiviral and antibacterial  ive got oregano oil in a liquid bottle and in softgels  i cant tolerate the liquid unless its diluted because its so hot  these little tubes of oregano oil are convenient and taste good but you only get 50mg of oregano oil per tube  one softgel of oregano oil usually delivers about 150mg  if you dont want that much then these tubes are good alternative  i found that though they taste good getting all the oil out of the tube was impossible  theres always an amount left in the bottom
wish they had something like this years ago when our dog had spine problems  spent a lot of money taking her in for red light therapy sessions back theni saw this therapy belt and had to get it  i know what red light therapy does and how much it helps the body repair itself or increase circulationthis therapy belt is so easy to use  comes with velcro strips so i can have it on my belly around my shoulder or on my back  longer velcro strip for larger areas  smaller strip for going around elbows knees or anklesi like that it has an automatic 20 minute shut down timer  this way i know im getting the maximum benefit from this therapy belt but not over doing it  it is comfortable to have on so its easy to forget i do have it on and runningim doing this twice a day as recommended  i want to see if this will help with my lower back pain  i know itll take some time for me to notice any changes in my pain levelthis is so great to have  and to be able to use it on my dogs too  what a bonus that isive seen first hand how much red light therapy can help both humans and dogs  and im excited to keep trying this and to always have it on hand to use after surgeries too for faster healing
i cant say enough good things about this product ive never been able to stick to a workout routine this long not only do you feel hydrated before your workout but it helps with stamina and performance  it is cheaper on the beachbody website but if you have amazon prime its exactly the same price with beachbodys shipping cost plus you get it in two days with prime so i chose to order it here
my only complaint is these dont scrub off hard dried foods of wipe tables and counters but other than that these are great
the item was used one time and then it stopped working  it would not turn on so in the trash it went
the adhesion of the pads is very strong and will have to be removed using water if its too strong  the smell is not offensive  will make nice gifts as well
i dont recommend this product at all
this is an excellent product one hundred percent nonirritating to the skin cleans and rinses off thoroughly very gentle and mild however it is too expensive
easy to use and can also serve as a back scratcher
that the wipes are thick and not thin
cute for girls who loves playing saxophones
good product
i use fix tape often and this brand is not the best  it does not have a great adhesive  i perfer anchor brand
gave it a 3 because i havent tried it yet  gave it a three because the blue ring around the middle was plastic wheni thought it would be soft and flexible product  believe i will enjoy it though but i only use it on trips which i havebeen taking lately
the frames are heavier than expected the nose pieces dig into the sides of my can only where for a short amount of time
yes its a little pricey but it smells great  i think it cleans well and i love that there is also stain spray and sticks as well as softener
i have a dog and live in an area with high pollen  ive had these for 3 years and replaced the bulbs periodically in my house my allergies are not an issue i have 3 of these in the areas of the house that are most occupied  living room and bedrooms  the noise doesnt stop me from sleeping  its white noise  i knew there was an issue when one of them started making louder noises i replaced the bulb and the noise was gone these imo are effective  i also have one at work i brought these from my town home that had smaller rooms  im now in a house with bigger rooms  still seems to work well my mother bought these to reduce the smell of perm in her shop it minimizes it
these wipes are barely suitable for use they are tiny and dry they barely remove dirt i guess you get what you pay for
it seemed to work pretty well for the first year the batteries had to be replaced after 1 year give or take a few days so i was happy about that but one very disconcerting thing i noticed was that it would give me a different weight when it was moved to different areas of the floor which i then knew i wouldnt buy it again but then i started to notice inconsistencies between what my scale said and what my doctors office scale and even what my sisters bathroom scale weighed me i also used it to monitor the weight of a 13 yr old cat which is even more important to me than keeping track of my own weight now after less than only 2 years and its stopped working altogether which is completely unacceptable
ill first begin by saying that probably a good thing i didnt like this product therefore it didnt end up using it i say this because i would have ended up scarring the heck out of my face had i used it even onceheres what i did like about this productthe case the case was truly beautiful it was as if it were from i dont know the 40s or the 50s when they used to make things really well and a truly was beautifulthe price point for around 8 i thought that there was a lot within the set as far as various implements so therefore i thought insofar as money wise you got good bang for your buck as a consumerhere is what i did not like about this setextraordinarily extremely and exceptionally dangerous when im telling you these things are surgically sharp im telling you these tools are surgically sharp  you could so easily hurt yourself and certainly scar your skin using any of these tools and i would not recommend it for the removal of blackheads or relief of pimples  no one perhaps not even a trained professional could wield these tools in the safe mannerlastly one of the implements that i managed to pull out of course i stabbed myself in the process but thats beside the point the head of this tool fell off immediately when i pulled it out i looked everywhere on the floor for it couldnt find out where fell to this day havent found it cuz i thought to myself maybe id glue it back but even still a brand new item should not be falling off like that regardless if if youre easily able to glue it back on or not so thats why i say that it has the illusion of being high quality but the reality it really wasnt the highest quality producti suppose because of the beauty of it it could be a gift  but im telling you that it is so dangerous that i wouldnt recommend it to anybody and i certainly wouldnt buy it again
product does a pretty good job and they are much cheaper than custom havent found the perfect product but this one is better than most
this is a great little straightener if you understand that it is not intended to be your everyday straightener i bought it for camping i charged it in texas and i used it 7 days later in a colorado national park it still had a full charge but after using it for 15 minutes it was at 50 charge it says it heats up to 205c but it definitely does not get that hot i have fine straight hair already and this does the job for me but it will take at least twice the time as my regular babyliss i think someone with coarse curly or super long hair would be frustrated the plates are only two inches long i also plan to put it in my car for those times i want to freshen my hair after work or after working out it comes with a usb charging cord so i can charge it in my car overall it is a very good purchase if you use it for traveling or small touch ups
really helpful
this is a great natural product to help boost immunity i was constantly getting sick and needing bout after bout of antibiotics when a friend recommended immuplex to me i admit that it took several months before i noticed a real difference but once it kicked in it works like nothing else i rarely get sick and if i do im able to get over it much faster than before give it a try be patient and it will work
have you ever tried to get a tiny screw put back into your glasses only to find you cant  dont have the right tools  that was me when i tried to put a screw back into my mothers glasses  this kit has the right tools that i neededthis kit appears to me to be a great variety of anything i may ever need to fix eyeglasses  i have tried to show pics of the various pages that show the contentsthis kit just might be a lifesaver in the future  i am happy to have it
looks nice and works great on my metal door
i like these types of facial cleansing devices  i have 3 of them now and really like using them to exfoliate dead skin cells off my face  this one is gentle works well  i dont know how long it will hold a charge but my other two that are very similar hold a charge for a long time  i dont use any electronic facial devices except for this one and i think it does a good job at gently loosening up dead skin cells
the size is not 32 gallon more like 24 gallon will not fit any of my 4 small bathroombedroom trash cans the first bag tore in half when i tried to pull it off the roll the second split down the side when i tried to put it in a small 3 gallon trash can i will not buy them nor would i recommend them at any price
good solution and inexpensive
very handy for getting to those areas old age makes it hard to reach
no complaints about this turmeric powder the aroma when opening the bag was very rich the taste was also excellent and not at all muted as some turmerics ive used i use this mainly with rice or rice substitutes such as wheat berries couscous and the like and both the taste and the strong yellow color make for a tasty dishi like that while it is priced similar to a bulk item it comes in three fairly small 4 oz bags that allows for cost savings by buying in bulk but the smaller packages help maintain the freshness until its ready to be usedfresh tasty and a good value hits all the right marks
this eye mask is very comfortable and unlike my previous mask it genuinely blocks all of the light out my other one is made of contoured foam like this one but the inner padded design around the nose area is what makes the difference that is what prevents light from peaking in from the middle of the mask great design reasonable price
this a great little pack of sanding blocks  i also use this to sand cardstock for card making  but do love them to buff and smooth nails before adding polish
this product is really great and the price is excellent for the amount of mg per cap
i took off one star due to the cotton wrapping around each earplug it was very hard to get off it took a while for just one  i just found out why  it was very hot yesterday i opened one this morning only 70 in here now and the cotton came right off i added a star back on to 5  the cotton is not a problem  i think the reason noted in packaging for the cotton was not to use plastic more earth friendly however there was no need to wrap these in anything  i use macks they come open in a row they are a different material but same could have been done with these  i finally unwrapped one and it fit and molded into my ear nicely
super thick layers that really dont lie flat against your face found this mask to be fairly uncomfortable and always choose another over it
love these little drops  the taste is delightful and they work when i have occasional gas
oh gosh oh gee oh mymy sister was just saying they got her husband a foot massager at one of the membership club stores and that they felt it was a waste of money this one isnt even though i got it at a discount in exchange for a fair unbiased honest review i am amazed by this  i have never had a foot massage like this  it has a bunch of functions air pressure makes the massage harder or milder start out low and there is also a function that gives you the option of high and low levels of heat  there is also a kneading massage and a shiatsu massage as well as an air pressure massage and yes there is a major difference with the shiatsu massage hitting all sorts of areas between and around the areas that the kneading massage hits there is a timer and an auto function that cycles through other functions but that does not seem to include the shiatsu massage this is really really pink  it is also very high tech with glowing lights at the front the first thing i actually noted was how heavy it is the handle in the top of the box is really helpful the drawing says the covers in the foot areas are detachable but i didnt see how to detach them so suggestions would be welcomei dont want to wreck my new toy  or maybe it will be in another review  ive had it turned off for 10 minutes now and can still feel a difference in my feet and lower legs
my grandmother used to buy these and they really work and dont smell like the thing youre trying to cover up and food like most other sprays do  i dont want to smell something yummy and bathroom smells mixed together its disturbing thats why i like this stuff it does a good job of masking the smell and not being gross i have yet to get tired of it either  not sickly sweet or too floral it is a strong smell but not overpowering  very well balanced
this stuff actually works i use it to spray my gym sneakers and it neutralizes the scent it has very little scent itself too
i love music and as one of my favorite music professors always says live music is always better than dead musicjust in the past year and a half ive really started getting into the live concert scene let me rephrase that ive started getting into the live rock concert scene ive always been a frequent attendee of wind ensemble and orchestra concertsive also always have had a mild case of tinnitus or ringing in the ears this ringing is evidence of hearing damage and it irreversibleneedless to say going to rock concerts without hearing protection left me with a few nights of extraringing ears and almost certainly hearing damage as wellmore recently ive actually been experiencing perforations of my ear drum and even just this year a full burst because of all of this i decided to get my hands on a pair of ear plugsthe problem for me is that i cant just wear any old foam earplugs im a bit of an audiophile and those regular earplugs just make everything sound muffled which for me defeats a lot of the purpose of going to a live show in the first placethats where the downbeats come in they are a special type of ear plug that lets most of the sound profile in but cuts the volume to a safe level they advertise 18db noise reductionspoiler alert they really do work as advertised i wore them at a five hour metalcore concert this past weekend and im happy to report that i didnt have ringing ears after the show i also was able to hear all of the frequencies just quieter i could still feel the music and it wasnt quiet by any means but it was not a damaging loudnessone thing to note is that unfortunately these earplugs cut out conversation almost completely at a concert event conversations are hard at a concert event generally because of all the noise but these made it noticably harder to hear i found myself removing one plug if i wanted to talk to my friendsrelated to conversation these earplugs tend to make you talk even quiter than normal because of how they sit in your ear canal you end up hearing your voice pretty loud in your head so you talk quiter to other people with them in its really a minor inconvenience though considering that these save your hearing again you can just remove one when you feel the need to talk and that solves the problemthe downbeats fit pretty comfortably which is to say that i could wear them for the whole five hours of the show to me they feel like inear headphones you definitely notice a pressure in the ear canal but its not terribly unpleasant that means a lot from me because i despise in ear headphones because i find them incredibly uncomfortableluckily even though these earplugs sit very similar in the ear to inear headphones they stay in much better one of my biggest fears in getting fancy earplugs was that they would fall out while i danced jumped headbanged and otherwise moshed at the show i am happy to report that these earplugs stayed in very well and i never once had a problem with them slipping out or feeling loose these are earplugs that i would recommend for metal hardcore rock punk etc showsthe downbeats also dont stick out from the ear very far which is nice because you dont have to worry about catching a bump from the crowd and shoving the earplug too deep into the ear damaging the ear drum rock shows get intense this also means that the downbeats are pretty inconspicuous so you dont have to worry about everyone in the crowd knowing youre wearing earplugsi didnt have any problems removing the downbeats from my ears after the show although i have read reviews that said people did have some trouble with this the included carrying case is also a really convenient storage system for when you take the plugs out which is always a bonus its made of metal and could definitely take a beating although i didnt subject it to oneoverall these are highly recommended by me i liked everything about the product and i look forward to taking them to more shows in the future but even if you choose not to get this product or if it doesnt work for you wear earplugs to concerts people
this is the best stain remover ever
does the job removes the lint
when your physical therapist only gives you one sleeve per week this product is well worth the money so you can change your sleeve whenever you want to you can also snip a much smaller hole for your thumb so it stays on and lasts longer  after surgery on each thumb i needed to be in a brace for several months i love that i can make them the length i want  you can wash them but they come out all raveledjust cut yourself a new sleeve
perfect fit with my okley radar the rubber is a bit less soft than okleys original but it works perfectly very happy 10 years after buying my okleys is like having bought a new one
i have used styling products my whole life but only started using a flat iron a few years ago  i like that one and yet thought there might be something better especially since ive been using the flat iron for both straightening and light waves of latei love the sleek all black look of this iron  its a little smallerslimmer than my old one and it has a nice long swivel cord  it heats up superquickly as promised and the auto shutoff is a nice feature  unfortunately the coloring of the temperature display makes it very difficult to read the numbers especially as i am getting ready in the morning without my reading glasses  note you will have to press both the power button and the temp button at the same time to switch the temperature reading from c to ffor straightening my hair i found that the iron generally performed well  i didnt really see any different between the floating plates of this iron and my old iron but still the iron worked well for my fine hair  i had more trouble using this iron to create waves  the sleek black case is aesthetically pleasing but has no real tractiongrip making it hard to twirl the iron for curling  although there are small grips at the end of the iron these arent tapered and dont work well at all  adding to the challenge is that the plates go all the way to the end so when gripping the tips and trying to turn the iron i burned myself several timesif you plan to use this iron for straightening only it may work for you but if you are looking for a more versatile styling product i would not recommend this iron
great bottles perfect for making recipes to use for the whole family the dark color helps to ensure those oils sensitive to direct light are protected roller heads snap in and work great
came doa currently talking to them on a replacement
good item
used to line up my undercut  works like a dream  it cuts close and does not bite the skin  i also use on my brothers hair and he wants to steal it  nope get your own
i have loved this for years but the stores quit carrying itthey also changed the wrapper from black to white so i did not recognize it when it was aroundits fat free and quite delicious not like any other i have triedi came here looking for this because it really is my favorite and was thrilled to be able to stock up the six bottles arrived quickly and were carefully packed and doubleboxed
this product smells wonderful oddly as you can see the label claims it to be unscented and the listing claims it to be scented i believe it might be mislabeled but it doesnt matter because this product is very good you spritz it on to the stain and work it into the fabric after letting it sit for a couple of minutes run water through the fabric or blot with a wet clothi found that with most stains i had to do that twice but on the good side its clear that this is safe for a lot of hand washables as long as you are gentle and dont rub the stain too hardive had those big commercial brands of stain removers make things worse by fading the area that you spray them in that was not the case with this product it might not be as effective but its not going to damage your clothes if you have something delicate andor your clothes are a huge investment invest in this product as wellanother plus is that the 2 oz spray is good for travelso this might be a product that you need or another one might be best for you hopefully this review has helped you to decide
my father has macular degeneration this vitamin doesnt seem to help that much but then this supplement is meant as a preventive measure and is less effective once you have a deteriorating condition given that most of us are on our computer screens or cell phones for more than 10 hours a day i notice that i have more floaters when i dont take this vitamin its easy to swallow and best taken with food over the long term i dont know how effective it is but taking lutein for your eyes certainly cant hurt and im glad it works on my floaters
35 gallon white bucket  lid  durable 90 mil all purpose pail  food grade  contains no bpa plastic pack of 1 needed one for around the house it is nice and sturdy not to big nor to small for general use
i do not see the point of these brush straighteners they do not do the job like a proper flat one
used it daily for a month and saw no results i would add that this is oil so it makes your face look weird oily i wouldnt bother with it
this will fit large heads i have a 2375 head and this has plenty of stretch and adjustability it can easily go larger than my head measurementsthe soft foam cups are comfortable the exact fit will vary i find they block out all the light and unless i am resting my head in such a way to push on them there is very little light that will sneak through im a side sleeperthe soft foam cups allow the eyes to breathe lashes dont get smashed eye creams likely stay in placealthough stretchy and adjustable it is hard for me to find that sweet spot where it isnt too snug that it creates creases come morning nor too loose that it doesnt fall off migrate away from my eyes i found the snug fit worked better as it kept the mask from rotating in the night and off my eyes but i wake with indents i cant have thatother aspect that has troubled me is that sometimes it gets caught in my hair the spot that has the adjustment hardware is prone to snagging my hairso i go back to my old trust stand by which is a tube of material it looks like a headband and it continues to be my most favorite sleep mask of all time if it rotates it doesnt matter because it is a tube so i am always covered  i have been using nightly since i got it 6 months agowwwamazoncomdpb07rjqgv61this one by cyraneme is a close second though comfort quality adjustability and the fact that it can actually fit large heads are all positives in my opinion the rotation and the indents and hair snag is variable depends on if i can find that sweet spot for fit i definitely have tried other sleep masks that i never used ever again this i will use it is still at my bed side
im a small guy at 165lbs so it took some breaking in for this cushion to finally give my hamstrings some reliefbut now i cant drive without it if youre a truck driver and youre looking for a cushion this is the one you want to get as all others wont cover the dimensions of the factory truck seat
i wear these overnight with some foot cream and they do an amazing job of softening rough heels
i recently had gum surgery so having the opportunity to test this toothpaste came at the right time this toothpaste has a very nice refreshing taste and cleans the teeth it is kind of a yellowish color gel  it tastes fresh but is mild so it doesnt burn or sting the gums as some toothpastes do  it is the perfect tooth product to use after dental surgery but it is really a pleasant toothpaste to use especially if you have sensitive gums  highly recommend

please dont waste your money on this it doesnt work
i honestly cannot say i have really used it to vouch that its sturdy on any actual use but i can say that when i received it i inspected it thoroughly and i found it to be very sturdy the snap on the outside of the case snaps very securely  doesnt pop open wthe slightest touch the size is perfect especially for a 4 compartment sleeve ive always found that either the individual compartments are really small or really big if im gonna be out for the day i will take the sleeve for that day in my bag  bc of the bright colors i dont have to rummage through my bag to find it impressive bc my bag is always full of a bunch of junk i also have times where i will be gone for several days so i will take the whole case  it fits in my bag wno problem even wall of my junk in itso im really happy wit for 2 reasons 1 the bright colors have made my life so much easier to find wout having to take everything out of my bag2 i really like the fact that there is an outer case that snaps securely so i dont worry about dropping it  all the individual sleeves popping open  then have to spend 15 minutes on trying to find every single pill which usually involves moving all of my furniture bc my floor is hardwood so i dont even have carpet to help it stay relatively in the same area where i dropped them
i had read that lavender was a natural deterrent to moths we had been experiencing a moth problem in our older condo we had just moved into it seems to be working and we love the fragrance of lavender this product is far more preferable to mothballs

the arlo cameras i purchased about 3 years ago are notorious for consuming battery life ive purchased many different brands of batteries since becoming an owner of arlo cameras and the energizer cr123a have had the absolute worst performance in a pack of 50 not one set lasted more than 6 days range 36 days compare this to disposable tenergy batteries which consistently lasted an average of 25 months and titanium batteries which lasted an average of 7 weeks ive also purchased a number of brands of rechargeable batteries which last anywhere from 4 days to 2 weeks before requiring a recharge this may have been just this particular package but im unlikely to try energizer again
i used this for like an hour today alone on different spots it isnt too rough or too slow well the slowest speed it a tad slow so i went with medium speed my neck and upper back feel so nice right now it is pretty light weight so you can carry it around in your car and it comes with a car adapter too which is neat the heat really is not warm at all i can tell it is there but only if i walk away and come back with it on it didnt do much though but i really like this and will definitely be using it a tonupdate please be careful how you use it do not really lean on it too hard i actually got bruised twice using it i still use it because it does feel good just have to be careful how i use it lol
as expected

these are pretty good pillboxes the lids are really secure and they have a decent amount of space they work great but theres one problem once you put the pills in them the only way to get them back out is to completely dump the box upside down i have skinny fingers and i still cant get them out and of course dumping it means that i drop pills more times than not its a design flaw for sure but the product still does a great job otherwise
this is a nice blend of essential oils for aromatherapy in a rollon tube the directions say to apply a small amount to the temples and behind the ears the inside or outside of the wrists or just inhale deeply i used this several times already and love the fragrance but dislike that the aroma wears off in less than 30 minutesit is made in the usa i am not sure where the ingredients are from the ingredients are pure sweet orange bergamot lavender and cedarwood essential oil in a base of fractional coconut oilthe tube does not say this is vegan even though the amazon site says thatif this lasted longer i would have rated this 4 or 5 stars
i  like this but handle needs to be 4 inches  longer
ive been taking a coq10 supplement for the last several years mainly because its very good for heart health  these gelcaps are big but not too hard to swallow and only one per day is the dosage  im not a coq10 expert but as far as i can tell these are good quality and i have no reservations in taking them

i occasionally get migraines and they last all day and dont go away for anything its miserable and nothing ive tried makes it any better i got this ice roller and it helps with the pain and throbbing so i can at least eat something and get on with my day the rolling part comes off so you can put that in the freezer and leave the handle out theres a notch on both sides of the circle that make it easy to pull off the handle and you dont scratch up the roller its easy enough to put it back on and get rolling
it works  easy to apply doesnt damage fabric  disposable is very convenient
no complaints at all about this silicone scar sheets the material is nicely durable and peels off the backing without issue it adheres very well i use this on the back of my hand and it stays put for the whole day without a problem despite the good adhesion it is not painful to remove and it leaves no residue behindthe size is well suited to small areas so that you dont need to waste any in trimming the cost per inch or foot is quite good since this comes in a 120 inch 10 foot roll it stores well  the roll i received in january 2022 has an expiration date of september 2024im not sure of the country of manufacture it is distributed by a french company but it doesnt specifically state where it is madeno complaints its a good quality silicone sheet that works well and is a good value pricewise five stars

great product use for my bunnys litter box
this is great that it has so many different shaped wells for meds  i think my pills were just too small and over 50 of them ended up being crushed  it will probably work perfectly on larger pills
its an expensive toothpaste i was interested because i watched a videoblog of a redheaded american girl in japan saying what theyve got that we dont  and one of the things was toothpaste like this because it fills in holes or somethinganyway i use it and i have no holes in my teeth since i started using it 3 weeks ago
the shampoo is very good the lid is a bit shaky as im sure other reviews probably state but the shampoo is very good it gets right into your scalp and works so well on all that annoying dandruff my scalp is very dry and upset with pretty much any type of weather all year round currently its mad at the sun and the end of summer weather i used this and after three uses if felt and looked quite a bit better i still have dandruff but its an ongoing battle and this shampoo is really helping in the fighti would recommend giving this a shot if you are having some issues it does help the lid is not the best made and it can leak a little but its still worth it just be careful with the lid

my work requires a lot of hand washing and hand wringing but i need an accurate watch not connected to my arm that i can check often this is marvelous the watch hangs from the lanyard when i need to measure time or tucks into my shirt pocket when i do not the watch is accurate and seems rugged enough to last
nice small massager  sometimes it hits a little too hard for my tastes but i just adjust my body and it works well  i like the option to have heat or not  it also has a stretchy strap that can be added to your chair  i have mine wrapped around a sturdy pillow and put it behind me on the sofa
terrible product ive tried to use it several timesevery time its completely messed up my nails the fingers are too long and bulky great ideabut dont bother if you have small hands
i have ordered these supplements several times  they always come quickly and are a very easily absorbed calcium with other trace minerals
i have found these to be really great at taking advantage of all the health benefits of coconut oil i am not a huge coconut oil fan taste wise but these are just fine and i can take them no problem i do find at three pills a time that it is a bit much to take especially with the pills being big i noticed a little bit of an energy boost so far but thats about it i just really like that i can safety take it while breastfeeding and it can still help me lose the baby weight
works as expected
this is a small pack of lozenges with a lot of zinc which is a proven ingredient for speeding ones recovery from flus and colds the price is somewhat high for the amount you get but it seems to work overall its ok but i still prefer airborne which is a better value
the picture of the product is completely misleading this looks like a gold and orangish red and it is not in actuality you are getting orange and a very dark red i was going to use this for a tiger face palette because the white often can be a problem in the orange yellow and white palette dont know what i will use this for i love the quality of the paints by this company so i will find a use for them
i got this flavored sparkling water with the dragon fruit flavor before i drank it it was nicely chilled sadly this did not help the overall experience i know it has a lot of good for you ingredients but sadly i couldnt stand this beverage at allit says zero calories zero sweetener zero carbs zero sugar but sadly i have to say horrible flavorto me this is a complete miss i struggled drinking one can of this and now i have 11 more in my fridge i wish this would have been better now i wish i would have gotten the variety pack to see if any of the other flavors would have been better but i didnt
my husband has chronic dry eyes he loves these wipes says nothing he has used helps as much
you use more elbow grease to get things clean then the actual product cleans may as well use a lemon and salt for all the scrubbing that you have to do
long and sturdy brush thats easy to clean works great and quality looks long lasting
works really well was surprised at how easy they cut my nails
i purchased over 20 pairs of these  for my various shoes to reduce my plantar fasciitis pain they never stick permanently but they work well for me however these arch supports look and feel nicer i particularly love the heartshaped design i also tried similar arches  but now i am liking this betterthere are two pairs in this package it is perfect for a tall arch like mine and they feel very comfortable in my sneakers they do have an adhesive backing but i do not expect them to stick forever so far they provide me with good support i might purchase these in the future over my dr scholls or the other ones i just tried they are all good to me
as long as i have to use a cane it might as well be pretty  and this cane is pretty as well as affordable  i love it
i love method products we were always huge tide fans but i tried method once and had to make the switch  great at getting out stains even if you forget to pretreat and seems like it leaves clothes looking 34newer34 less pilling of the fabric even when something is washed frequenyly  very nice subtle fragrance  bottles take up almost no space on the shelf  easy to dispense
taste good quite costly but dairy free which i needed

perfect for sunburn itchy or dry skin
this is very small  now i put this in my bedroom as i wanted to see if it would bother me at night and whether or not it would work to clean the air  i do have sinus issues and for some reason at night my nose will clog up and then ill get up blow my nose lay back down breathe easy for a while then clog up again  i am assuming i have some dust or other allergen in the air thats bothering me  after plugging this in and setting it where i wanted on the table next to my bed the sound is very quiet and for several nights in a row while using this air purifier i did find that my nose didnt clog up nor did i have to get up to blow my nose during the night  does that mean this machine is working  i would have to say yes since it is the only thing that changed in my room for those nights  i will try it in the kitchen the next time i burn something and create some lingering smoke in the room  im very curious to see if it works like their video shows  based on its use in my bedroom i would say this air purifier works very well
the other reviews about a medicinal metallic smell were right i should have listened  im not a fan of this one  would not put in my drink  its okay for defusing  just doesnt smell right
purchased this chair from the buyer and after a few months it began fading to now a  year later the chair has completely lost its color  upon further research and seeing other sellers offer warranties for the chair i contacted this seller only to send a very rude email stating for me to  wash chair with soap and water  the chair is not worth what you are paying  especially when other sellers offer warranties  please do yourself a favor and dont purchase this chair from this seller  find another who will back up there product with warranty

i tried nervine tonic after watching a video from a notable herbal company which touted the products effectiveness  i cannot deny that the product worked as a relaxant and sleep aid  however i did find that my sleep was almost too deep and i had trouble waking up  because of this i would use with caution and be extremely diligent with dosage
i have reviewed before  i was totally disappointed as this did not work on my glasses  one side or another kept sliding off
i stand all day at work and so got these to go in a pair of dressier shoes that i have to wear occasionally my feet are slightly fatigued after standing on these all day but its significantly better than the shoes by themselves would recommend
stopped working after 1 month

these are very cute and were sent very quickly yes they do have big tags that can be removed in a few minutes from the whole set  get over it  yes mine were patterned in the horizontal instead of the vertical  not an issue for me in a hair scrunchie  oh and they fit my averagesized woman wrist easily  i get compliments whenever i wear one and am doing the good fairtrade thing

the cloths comes off the holder too much trouble to use
i love these theyre great i use it on sore muscles  onmmy face every day and night works very well  is very effective i love that it has 2 to chose from
im only giving it four stars instead of five because all the pills from both bottles fit into one so its kind of a waste of bottles but this is a great supplement no garlic taste afterward and they go down like a breeze

i took this product to my physical therapist she tried to put it on and had great difficulty it did not fit it does not go low enough to support the back as well as pull the shoulders back one person alone would have difficulty my therapist does not recommend this product nor do i i returned the product the feedback i received from the seller said they are made to not go lower as people have big belliesmy therapist said she does not recommend any type of device as they are too difficult for the user to put on especially one with pain
the product does last longer and is stronger than the original formula
i think this mix did give me a little extra energy the other day when i had two tennis practices nearly back to back  i have tried this mix several times and though i havent noticed a jolt in energy i didnt get overly fatigued either especially while playing in the hot sun  it mixes well with plain water though it seems to settle out a little bit if left to sit in the glass for a while  the flavor is not all that good  it has a strong almost bitter flavor that i dont really care for  i have since started mixing this with another electrolyte mix that has a sweeter and more pleasant flavor  i like the combination and it really keeps my electrolyte level up when sweating and exercising in the heat
very disappointed these were the first pair of shears for me as i am a nursing student  these could barely cut through two layers of gauze
noisy and ineffective all it did was pull at my poor cats butt furs and make him real mad the clipper guard was too long to even touch his hairs and the product came with no other sizes
i lift a lot both at the gym and at work this gives me great back support i like the fact that its adjustable so when i need more or less support i can adjust as needed i had this on while sitting as well and it helped me sit upright  proper posture im sure if i continue wearing it for the great  back brave it is i might see my waist shrink as well but the sole reason i bought this was for my back i was fortunate enough to purchase this item at a discounted price in return for my honest opinion
maintains sharpnessreasonable price
i have not yet been able to figure out how to have the light come on at the time that i want it to i have been through the poor instruction book that came with it but cant figure out how to program the  thing to work the display light is a bit too bright for when the lights are off and the nature sounds are annoying i think you need to keep looking if you are looking for a lamp that slowly lights up in the am
this pain relief cream from the appropriately named dr paine didnt work that well for me there is a slight menthol scent and the lotion is absorbed quickly without leaving much residue which is a good thing however it seems ineffective for strong back pain for some reason i associate strong smelling creams with higher potency  since this one is mild it doesnt seem to have much impact the positive thing is that you can apply the cream and go out without someone noticing a strong scent however i prefer ben gay for providing stronger pain relief this one is just meh
im new to wood repair kits but our contractor suggested using this sort of kit to hide small cracks and scratches  depending on the depth of the scratch i used the wax crayon first and then the marker to cover the color  i used this on our older scratched furniture and on the wood accents on our window sills  not too difficult although it takes some time to get used to the materials  it did help make scratches less visible so the kit was worth it for us
it works great i thought it would be horrible quality bc its so cheap but its actually great not too rough on the skin and very smallcompact make sure to charge before you use
the glasses arrived in 10 days from china to the west coast well packed in perfect condition they included a sturdy trim little black zippered case and a microfiber cleaning clothi bought these after reading an article about ways to increase energy apparently looking at electronic screens exposes you to a blue light that tends to keep you in awake modewhich means itll be difficult to sleep when you want to an hour or so later yellow or orange tinted lenses block the blue light decreasing eye strain and allowing you to fall asleep more naturallyeven if you tend to be eyeing those screens right up until bedtime like i dothey seem to work and the magnification is fine im buying another pair for work
this broth is not going to be salty or flavorful enough for most peoplemixing a scoop into any big bowl of soup however adds a boost of healthy benefitsan added plus is that many ingredients are organic such as the spices and flavormaking my own bone broth is a process that takes forever and every minute of that process means that my dogs are whining because they know something good is cooking its easier on everyone when you can just take a scoop and mix it into hot water or soupim in my sixties and always get comments on how youthful my skin looks for my age part of it is the serums and moisturizers but a big part of it is taking collagen prior to using this i used the amy myers md chicken broth im more than satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of both
there is no surprise toy the only toy are the 3 egg toys its not actually toys inside of the bath bombs though our nephew was extremely let down to find this out
i was very excited for these to arrive as ive been looking for an affordable back massage tool when i opened the package i was so disappointed at what i actually received the tools looked as if they were put together halfhazardlythe legs of the massager were uneven for some reason they were all slightly different lengths so i couldnt even use it effectively the wood coating was also messy and not smooth at all there were globs and bubbles of dried coating on the wooden surfacei know this was a relatively inexpensive massager but i cant even enjoy at least one use so in my opinion i would certainly recommend spending a little more for a better quality product
really great size because there are 4 sections  even if you take lots caps there is so much room
this scale is perfecti ordered and received it almost faster than if i purchased at a king size pharmacy or some suchinexpensive with fast deliveryless spent than if l had to drive to purchaseand the best part is the product is accurate and well made buy oneyou will be pleased
small size makes it easy to store in purse or desk drawer works well
sneak those crazy beet nutrients into your yogurt or curry and fool even yourself and never waste another calorie with useless seconds of chewing aplus nice beety flavor too

my white vehicle had road tar in several areas this product was great removed all the tar after consistent pressure with a microfiber towel highly recommended
re the orange permanent deafmaker ear plugs aka lets go to the er at 5am plugs i put the orange plugs in and went to sleepat 4am i woke up with pain in my left ear i remove the right plug and try to remove the left plug but the clear plastic nib comes out and leaves the plug in my earfor the next hour i try to pull the plug out but i cant its painful and im worried i need to go to an emergency room without the clear plastic nib its impossible to grab onto i try tweezers but i cant get a gripat 5am i wake up my neighbor and ask them for help he tries the tweezers but it doesnt work we decide to gently insert a wooden toothpick into the hole where the clear plastic nib used to be and after about 30 minutes of very careful jiggling we get it outi crymy neighbor consoles me we go to bed i cant sleep my adrenaline has been activated i normally wake up at 9am so i lost 5 hours of sleep that nightthis is dangerous and should never be sold to consumers re the gummy silicone earplugs these are the most usable but they worry me they arent effective unless the gummy part extends into the ear canal which youre not supposed to do based on the directions but if you do this it forms a vacuum seal and does pretty good at keeping sound outthe issue is that if you so much as tap your ear youll feel it on your ear drums because of the seal you have to be very very very careful when you pull these out or youll rupture your eardrumsif you put them in like youre supposed to just covering the outside of the ear canal they let almost all of the sound in still they cant be used safely in my opinion and i recommend not using them in an unsafe way just to get them to work i was desperate and so i did it the unsafe way but dont do what i did re the other earplugs the grey bombshaped ear plugs were not effective at all for me they sat in my ear and let all the sound in still they have clear plastic fins on them to pull them out and although mine didnt break like the orange earplugs did i would still be afraid of them being a safety hazard if they did breakthe blue christmastree shaped earplugs seem the safest they are all one piece of rubber and so it seems like a very low risk of breaking and you can safely insert them and they seem to work the only issue is theyre not really meant to block sound so much as reduce volume so i can still hear snoring construction work etc plus they have a long piece that sticks out and prevents you from putting your ears on your pillow comfortably if you sleep on your back or you dont use them for sleeping they would be fine id recommend this pair to you if you just need to reduce noise and not block it out completely and dont sleep on your side quick summary except for the blue christmas tree shaped earplugs i would recommend you just throw these ear plugs in the trash so you dont hurt yourself
there arent quite as many decorations included in this pack as expected but its perfect for decorating a smaller room or entranceway i didnt have any issues with defective balloons etc the mylar balloons were a hit with the kidsid definitely recommend this for any halloween party or for halloween night
uncomfortable but better hold than pro version
this product was priced very well but isnt top quality that being said what you do get is a nice cheap way to incorporate cupping into your massage practice you get quite a bit in size options so thats very helpful and they do maintain good suction the only thing i dont like is that over time the plastic cups show signs of being brittle and some have cracked they did last me quite a while for being so cheap so i cant complain i wasnt looking for a big investment so for the price it was worth it to me and i use it as my practice set i did enjoy the cupping procedure and the pump handle really lets you control the strength of the suction quite well so if youd like to try out cupping but dont want to invest in an expensive kit this one is the one for you the cupping technique has helped me with my shoulder pain as it really breaks up adhesions and gives more blood flow to the area i place the cup on a sore spot and suction the skin about half way up the cup and let it stay for a few minutes like that another technique is to put massage oil on the area of your skin first then suction it a little less than half way and then slide the cup around youtube has some great tutorials
heres the thingthese will not last you like a regular sponge so i had to get over that factheres what they willliamson do  theyll get in the tight spots clean the crappy chrome around your faucets better than anything in the market with less effor they get into nooks and crannies its their thing also good on mirrors  i keep them in the bathrooms and kitchen stainless steel rims etc look like new now

bought for my wifei have not heard her say any thing negative about it so i guess she is happy
good ingredients but hard to stay put on the gum ends up just a sawdust mouth experience where you have to spit it all out and rinse  hmm wish they made this in a gel form or paste or something other than powdered herbs
its as thick as the name brand and about the cost as you would pay at a box store but slightly less expensive then the name brand you can buy here
i actually bought this just for the blades i have a callus shaver but to buy the blades by themselves cost more than this set i gave the shaver to a friend with a blade installed she is pleased with it
i really liked it i gave it to my family member for them when they buy their new home
im on my second box of this  it makes the fermented vegetables have a much better flavor than run of the mill fermented veggies  i use the recipe recommended adding juiced celery and also add some himalayan salt  super tasty
greater magnification but shorter depth of field wouldnt work for my computer use so i returned them
comes in handy
work great for my husband  very well made
cinnamon mouthwash is a must in our household  my husband loved cinnamon listerene but that is no longer sold  so i found this  he actually preferred the lavoris  he said it has great flavor not too much alcohol just right
this swag is pretty but it is not as pictured the picture is showing purple and some pink  what i received is nice and full but it is all purple i might get more silk flowers to add to it because the one color is boring to me i put it on my front door
highly recommend great taste and great buy
had this unit for over a year now and its very quiteoriginally bought this to try to eliminate the cigarette odors that would come from downstairs neighbors who enjoy smoking on their porch on hot summer nights when youve your window open it worked okay wouldnt eliminate all but it definitely cut the odors downsince then weve moved to a smaller apartment and this unit is now by the cats litter box again though it cuts down on the odors it doesnt eliminate it all together actually feed your kitties those cat grass helps much more
i personally had one and sent to mom another one i didnt see any benefits from it myself i didnt feel it doing anything about the pain at all it was soothing to massage into my body and it doesnt have an offensive smell but as for ending pain not helpful mom said it was okay and it worked ok for her but she hasnt asked me to get her another one so i think it is not a completely fail but it is not worth it to get again
these tasty and nutritious bars are worth the price they are filling there is no chocolate in them just carob they do have mik and peanut butter however
these are excellent boxes for presenting gifts in  they are made of good white cardboard that have a nice sheen and a good texture  they are very easy to fold into a box and no instructions are necessary  just fold on the creases and slide the tabs into the slots on the bottom  i wouldnt put a particularly heavy object in them since the tabs and slots are all that keep the bottom intact  these boxes make a perfect cube shape
very poor quality
i apologize for not saying so sooner my fibromyalgia has good days and bad it is also extremely hot down here so i try not to be on amazon too long because i spent too much money lol but truly it is a beautifully crafted piece i use t for head piece during full moon rites but i do love it i plan to take a peek around your shop soon ty
exceeded my expectations i bought this for camping and travel we were able to put three large duffle bags air mattresses blankets and sleeping bags in it  everything stayed dry that left room for camping supplies in my toyota highlander and five passengers i used ratchet tie downs in addition to the ties included  put a rag under each ratchet to insure no rubbing  i also put tarps in the bottom of my hitch haul to insure that the hitch haul bolts did not wear holes in the bag  worked perfectly
very inaccurate readings do not buy waste of money
these pads are super thick and high quality they dont leak heavy duty i wish they were larger and less expensivei use them as dog pads for 2 small dogs not sure how they hold up for bed protection for people but they are the best quality ive ever gotten
my girlfriend used it on a burnt pot and it did a good job after seeing the results i wanted to get it for myself in case i need it
i bought these socks as gifts for nurses day they were awesome
i am a big believer in aromatherapy so i decided to try this one out  it smells amazing and it has helped me relax into a deep sleep  its very convenient to just spray it on my sheets before bedtime  i will definitely order again soon
bright colors
i struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water and ive never found other flavored waters or flavored drops to be enjoyable as you can always taste an overly sweet fake flavor i received a bottle of coconut water drops as part of a birthday gift and i became obsessed with just a squeeze or two of these infusion drops i can drink bottle after bottle of water and it fits into my new zerosugar lifestyle the only downside is the pricea bottle of water infusion drops lasts me less than two weeks so its pricey to keep up with my obsession though the fact that these drops make my water so yummy that i avoid soda probably makes it worth it
these are a decent option if you are looking for a reusable period product they are easy to use and clean but i do find them a bit bulky i like that the inner lining is black so i dont have to worry about stains
it does have an easy to read dial works better for me than digital as i am handicap and its difficult for me to step up straight on there course the only thing i dont really care for is my weight as it says what i really am lol
easy to make
this avcoo 4 channel tens unit for pain relief is not for me i got this for upper back pain the caution part says where my pain is could cause rhythm disturbances which could be lethalthe box comes with a muscle stimulator machine it has 12 electrode pads it also comes with cables a drawstring bag and instructionsi will not be recommending this avcoo 4 channel tens unit for pain relief to family and friends
quality product  just as advertised  works perfectly  will buy from here again
great tissues for cold and allergy seasons
just like my grandmother use to use
i hung them up at my friends surprise party as decorations and they were super cute very decently priced so i was very happy with my purchase
i had a cross made of silver and it was completely black from tarnishing i follow the directions and dip it in the solution for just a few seconds when it came out i wiped it and wonderful great product highly recommend
i always  try to buy this brand of tissue
works great and very well made
some people just cant sleep with total silence i can my wife cannot and we have a hard time finding something that we can both accept she wants the tv on it keeps me awake i like soft music it keeps her awake this tabiger white noise machine has so many options we found something that works for both of us the sound of waves gently lapping on the shore if you dont like that theres air conditioner train sounds rain frogs crickets a crackling fire birds soft piano music instrumental lullaby and more even just simple white noise the quality of the sound is very good and the multimode night light is a nice touch if you need sound to sleep soundly i recommend this device five stars
product was supposed to include 4 rubber feet mine only came with one
my favorite paper towel  very absorbent and i love that it feels like cloth
the socks are very well made and provide a lot of compression at first wearing maybe a little too much but after wearing them a few  times they are very supportive and not quiet as tight
shipping r  l carriers 626262top notch i was very concerned about this after reading some of the reviews here use the tracking number provided by amazon on the r  l carriers website my chair arrived 5 days early relax they do call you the day before and a signature is required i tipped the driver 20 to wheel the palletpackage into my garage for the night he came at 700pm  treat the man nice and hell probably do the same for you  just dont expect him to bring it into your house hes really not suppose to go further than the edge of your driveway where you put your trash canssetup the driver gave me some awesome advice leave the chair in the box when you bring it in the house yes believe it or not by doing it this way i was able to get this 244 pound beast inside all by myself  the secret is to slide the box where it is possible and 34walk34 the box where it is not for my 4 step porch i laid down a plywood sheet for a temporary ramp the shipping straps made excellent handles and your chair will have protection all the way to your mancave try it  you can always resort to cutting the box open if it doesnt work outassembly again some reviews had me nervous no sweat take your time 34eyeballing34 it the 34nonremovable34 retainer clips were already installed on the postsnot suppose to be but they were to solve the chinese puzzle gently insert a small flat blade screwdriver in the very middle twist slightly slip the clipretainer off the post gently it may take you 3 hands 5 minutes or both these are suppose to be oneshot retainers and they will break easilythere were no spares next get the leg assembly as close as possible connect the 3 colorcoded pneumatic hoses and 1 electrical connection first moistenlube the air connection fittings it will help slip the leg assembly support rings on the posts one at a time then reinstall the retainer clips the ac power and controller cables easily connect on the bottom back of the chair youre now ready for lift offthe ride holy smokes no buyer remorse here  this thing will have you smiling  heaven on your back and kinky on your ass another reviewer put it perfectly 34it works your butt over like a greek34 warning do not use more than 20 minutes 5 minutes in one specific area yes you will be tempted to ride all day but like a hot tub be sensible and dont over do it enjoy
when you cant get in the shower and want to feel refreshed or just clean these are really good to have around thick enough that you wont easily drive your fingers through the material but thin enough to be usable ok scent useful cloths
i had recommended sleeves like these for my boyfriend to offer ankle support and compression i own other types of sleeves like these that help me with my plantar fasciitis nevertheless he tried these and says they are very very comfortable he likes them as socks but says they do not offer any support or compression i tried them on and they are too big on me i got size 1315 and he takes a 13 shoe so these were the right size for himhe personally does not understand why they are open toe and neither do i nevertheless he likes them for other reasons other than what they are advertised for to him these are five stars for comfort but they do not hold up to the support claims therefore look elsewhere for ankle support
i looked endlessly for brushes that had a cleaning tip particularly one that worked well this is the answer  the cottonlime top gets everything clean  love these brushes
i loved the swarovski crystals  it was fun to have so much bling on my ears  the adhesive didnt stick well in areas on a ridge  also on each ear one of the crystals moved to the point of revealing the gold pellet underneath  i didnt mind they still looked pretty  be aware that some people such as myself react poorly to gold  i wont be able to use these for myself again and the crystal styles currently only come with gold plated pellets
worked great
works real good
this laptop table works great
why take a product that is so simple to use and complicate it so much i followed the directions and could not get it to heat up it might work great but i dont have the patience to figure it out so am returning it
this appears to be the right sponge for my wand but is isnt i bought these in november and having run out of the sponges i had i reached int the cupboard and grabbed a  new sponge wow im i disappointed  it doesnt fit my wand the shape of the sponge is correct but the base is wrong its way past 30 days so i cant return them maybe i can find a new wand but really what a pain be careful check the base not only the sponge
ok to use with adult supervision in case kids wanted to step on fragile cause glass
this does nothing to make foundation smoother if anything it makes it look like i have tried to put makeup on with a plastic bag
i love this stuff  im not sure of its health benefits but it has great flavor and is a healthier alternative than a lot of other additives to water
let me just start from the beginning first the packaging for this is super cute and totally is what drew me to this energy supplement the packaging draws you in and the name itself totally makes you want to see what this is then you read cherry bomb and i was totally intrigued and it sounds like it would be an awesome flavor this stuff ticked all my boxes on looks and drawing me inhowever when i opened it and smelled what was in this nope nope oh heck to the nope nope i have to be completely honest i cant even tell you what it smelled like because its not something ive ever smelled yeah tells you exactly what it is huh i know its driving me crazy too because its this strong striking scent that you think you know but then when you think about it you really have no idea then i tried it worst mistake ever its like battery acid meets stomach bile except id rather drink that the worst part is while i was very hesitant to even try this after smelling it i was like ive tried things that smelled horrible tried it and honestly it was awesome however me being dumb and super thirsty i ended up downing half a bottle before wanting to rip my tongue out its messed up because it started out totally fine until you stop drinking and then the smell turns into the taste my tongue is still mad at me and i dont blame it i still have remnants of the smell and then it reminds me of the taste and i spit up a bit yeah its gross its more than gross seriously dont buy this stuff and being someone that drinks zero sugar drinks and sugarfree stuff its not this being sugarfreeon another note i wish everything came with the little scoops that glytch uses its a scoop and funnel in one and is totally genius so at least i got a super awesome scoop out of this horrid stuff
what a lovely presentation to give as a giftthat said i eat almost 100  vegan and not looking to lose weight as thissays it will keep you fullbut im looking for eating healthymct oil is healthy for your body and i use it for my salads with allot of seasoningsthere is not any taste to thismost people use this in there coffee which i do not drink andin there tea  although i do drink tea but i have not put this in itbut i do put this in a smoothie when im in a rush and dont havetime to eat  although i think smoothie are a waste as there is notany fiber left in a smoothie there so parredi do think this is pricey and is clear that it should becomes in a nice glass clear bottle that looks like  a bottle of vodka
these are the cheapest piece of crap you could by  the sleeve itself doesnt stay in place and the padding inside is a piece of itchy scratchy egg crate foam  there is no cover on the foam  i cannot believe this item has gotten such rave reviews  i will be posting a video to show you the quality or lack of it with this product  you are better off buying something else like futuro which is what i am using now for my ulnar nerve issues which have been bothering me both day and night  the futuro elbow support has been working great and i highly recommend it
i am very happy with this product i hate taking bulky vitamins and trying to remember how many to take this is a convienent and easy fit in my fast paced lifestyle it has no flavor and is a very fine powder this makes it easy to add to shakes yogurt or oatmeal the only thing i didnt like was the resealable bag it came in because it doesnt close well i just ended up putting the product in another container  this has been the best way for me to add these essential nutrients to my diet thank you
my hubby and i use the product to relaxand help with sleeping product works wellwell order again
this is the third time i have bought this product the sticks that were in the bottle were no longer working the sticks in the pouch did work but that meant 100 sticks did not on opening
seems to be working and i am not having the jitters or clenching my teeth i like the fact you can step off and not crash
i use this to make magnesium oil  i add 1 part water to 12 part flakes ex 1 oz water to 12 oz flakes if you want it stronger use 1 to 1 ex 1 oz distilled water to 1 oz flakes best to store in a spray bottle can also be used as a deodorant
very cheesy and crunchy the biggest problem is that i couldnt stop eating once i started
it arrived on time nice product clean smell
good stuff  as advertised
before you buy fan australian bush flower essence for this kind of a price do shop around
i got this to replace a plastic sterilite stool i used to get into my very high bed  the plastic stool had cracked and was unsafe this stool is heavy duty sturdy and stable it came fully assembled in an extra thick cardboard box it has crossbars between the legs to give more strength it has a nonslip surface on the step and does not slide on the floor  im glad i spent the extra money and got this stool that i expect will last a lifetime
works best on clean glasses slick packaging
when i pulled this out of the box i initially was caught off guard by how old school and basic this hair dryer looks but when i used it it completely changed my opinion this hairdryer blows but in a good way it dried my hair really fast way faster than my old hairdryer its windtunnellevel airflow and the high heat setting is super hot maybe even too hot sometimes its also lightweight and easy to handle i hope this lasts for a long time
a single tablet is plenty for a cup of coffeei think these are a bit sweeter than the same size splenda tabletsthis is great for home or an office desk drawerthe cylinder container is the diameter of a us quarteri have reordered two more 1200 tablet containers  i  take them with me when i travel
great holds well and makes a shower possibleinjury makes it impossible for me to reach very high and i was able to put this at the correct height for my use
i have allergies to long haired dogs and evergreens this is a natural allergy medicine that works wonders i have been dog sitting at my friends house who has a long haired dog and nettle has made it possible to still breathe thank you natures way
for when i am craving dark chocolate and raspberry  this one has good flavor high protein and less carbs  beware about eating more than one a day though  unless you are wanting a cleansing with cramps
this seems to be a wellformulated probiotic for women i have been taking it for about a week and i think that it has been helping me along with the other digestive enzymes pre and postbiotics that i take its hard to quantify exactly how much but it does seem to help with my digestion issues that come with post viral inflammation
the only way to buy them in bulk
ill start by saying that the pair of jade facial tools i received do indeed match the online product photos the gua sha scraper is a significantly darker shade of green than the lighter bright green hue of the accompanying roller im not sure why anyone would intentionally choose a set of paired tools that differ so drastically in color but at least theyve been accurately represented in the listingwhile the scraper is smoothly polished and comfortable to use and hold the dualended roller is rather noisy unlike most other jade rollers currently available this roller doesnt have the clear silicone plugs present inside each drilled cylinder so all rolling motions produce a clunking sound as the stones bump up against the metal bars of the triangleshaped hardware the stones are nicely polished and attractive otherwise and each end of the roller still provides adequate pressure but the overall functionality leaves a little to be desired since a silent rolling mechanism hasnt been ensuredat a current list price of 495 this is by far the cheapest jade facial set ive come across so it might be great for new users who are looking to test drive a pair of these tools before possibly selecting a slightly more expensive version but the visual impact of the widely different color shades is definitely distracting
this is a nice denture bath  good quality and comes in three pieces  the lid the inside basket and the outer bin  the lid comes off easy so its easy to access the basket  it just lifts out of the bin  i ordered the standard size and i was a little concerned it would be too small but nope  both my upper and lower dentures fit nicely
didnt work  i have a more textured curly hair type and this did nothing for me my regular flat iron does a better job at straightening and curling my ends maybe its more for naturally straight hair idk
life extension products have always been slightly over priced for the last 3233 years that i have purchased them but product works for my needs and you get what you pay for
its significantly louder than my other tool foot scrubber electric foot file callus remover hard skin remover pedicure tools for cracked heels and dead skin with 3 roller heads white by bompowon first try i thought it didnt powerup but you have to hold the power button down until it powers upi like that it comes with 3 heads to suit different issueswaterproof safe to use in the bath or shower i am shouting with happiness because this is the best ever so much better than all the manual toolsthe only negative is it doesnt come with a adapter for the wall only a usb charging cord also because it has different attachments a small cloth bag would have been wonderful to keep it all together
when i had surgery a few months ago i was unable to put my pillows over my head as id grown accustomed to doing i have a cpap machine with nose cushion mask and i used the pillows to hold that in place while blocking the light overnight but that surgery meant i couldnt use the pillows  i had to sleep on my back and propped a bit for two months so i got a night mask and have slept all the better ever since when my wife saw the difference in me she started to sleep with a mask as well  the darker night has made sleep deeper and more recuperativewe each have a mask we love the same gotten on amazon but we wanted a back up for her so she could wash that one from time to time i saw this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade and decided to give it a try ill admit  she thought i was off base with the wrap around design  it would not fit or it would be too hot or but she gave it a try she loves it1 this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade wraps around the full head i have a larger head wearing a lgxl baseball hat she does not  hers is much smaller this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade fits both of our heads comfortably2 i have not slept in this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade but i did try it on with my cpap nose cushion mask  it does not sit right i can get it closed and all the way around my head but i use it and the purpose is so as to block out all light with the cpap on there is a large gap at the base of the mask where it goes over the nose piece unlike other masks i have i cannot recommend this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade for someone with this type of cpap3 the materials are excellent this is a soft and luxurious wrap that feels cool and soft making for a very comfortable experience my wife did end up taking it off about halfway through the night feeling it heated her head too much to be fair she has the same issue with pillows but not with masks that have only the eyes covered with a strap around i had it on only for a brief time i felt i could go longer than my wife but again needing the cpap i am unable to use it4 what we both like is that there is a softening of sound with it on we use a sound machine to keep nighttime sounds drowned out but this adds to that  my wife really felt it helped her sleep a little more blocking out additional sound5 the velcro is easy onoff and it is well attached to the wrap keeping one from worrying itll detach  its secure6 looks nice for the ladies this has a nice feminine look  my wife says soas of this writing my wife loves it  as do i though it doesnt allow me to use it  and will use it often she does take it off it gets hot  but thats something that she feels is a personal thing in the end shes happy to have it and happy to recommend this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade mask
i am almost 50 and have noticed my focus and concentration on the decline i noticed a tremendous difference on the 2 dose 2 dayi was able to stay focused on a project for over 10 overs with distractioni am beginning to feel like my younger self
have no issues with them holding
the mask is soft but there was some color transfer onto my pillows  i cant explain why this happened  also the plastic adjustment clasp on the elastic band can gouge the side of my head  there must be better sleep mask options out there
wow im so happy about finding this product  i hope amazon continues to sell it  recently i had shingles and then got contact dermatitis  allergy so im trying the  free of  this one cleans as the ultra stain release original does just no fragrance tide and amazon come through again
very nice looking and seems sturdy
its a nice bunch of stuff  packed in a box for the money  it is worth  it very nice selection  of stones
these are nice for using on your face but they do not hold enough soap to clean larger parts of the body the two pads measure 3 x 25 and have soft silicone bristles that felt great on my face you squirt a little liquid soap on these and rub it on a wet face and the soap suds up nicely and cleans well the only problem is that soap can get on the other side and make the pad slippery to hold i just grasp the knob between two fingers rather than sticking my fingers in the pocket and then i can keep a pretty good gripthere is also a scrubber that has a sponge inside you can squirt soap on the sunny face then squeeze the sponge to create a fine white foam from the soap these bristles are a little bit firmer than the pads but they are still very nice feeling on the face the reverse side has thicker stiffer silicone bristles the sponge is pretty easy to squeeze and pull out of the hole it dries quickly when removed the scrubber is a nice size to easily hold and squeeze while using it is 2 inches tall by 2 inches wide
we use this to get my moms wheelchair from our kitchen into the sunroom  it works great  very sturdy
this is the best stuff for removing thermal compoundgrease much better than using rubbing alcohol
i think every household needs cleaning gloves these have the same quality as playtex they are latexfree so you dont have to worry if you have allergies there are different colors so you can color code according to task this is a great buythanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
just probably me but i didnt like smell i gave it to friend i want a real pine smell
it does seem to whiten your teeth  it is in powder form which does take a bit of getting used to  i dip my dampened tooth brush into the powder and brush my teeth  its black  so you really get all the edges cleaned getting out all the residual cleaner  it seems to be a natural alternative to chemical laden products
i held off on buying 13 cottons because i figured it couldnt be good for vaping its amazon cotton and its cheap but dont let that deter you i tried many different brands including cotton bacon prime cloud 9 wotofo cotton goose cotton etc etc this cotton keeps up with the best and has become a favorite of mine it has very little break in time lasts a long time and the flavor on it is as good as the best cottons  dont hesitate you wont be disappointed i sure wasnt
i recently scavenged a pair of these nose pieces from another pair of glasses and this order of 10 pair dshape screwon or clickon silicone nose pads 15 mm 10 pair d shape 15mm screw on was placed just after the change out  these are soft but still firm and will first be used to replace the scavenged pair and then be a reserve for future nose piece problems  i anticipate it to happen as my daughters parrots have chewed two off now  im ready for the next assault
sometimes this works against my nighttime leg cramps and sometimes it doesnt but i still like to have it on hand
really terrible product  has no power at all  waste of money
well built but dimensions are just enough off to limit use
i read tons of descriptions and reviews before i decided to give this product a try its been a while since ive had a pedicure my feet are in love the foot file did a pretty good job of removing rough skin without harm works much faster than a pumas stone i did my husbands feet and he likes a result too
pros this set contains just about every size cleaning brush you could possibly need to clean your combs razors and trimmers theyre incredibly easy to clean too cons i cannot think of anything negative to say about this kit love it
i cannot get these to work  not a good idea for me
broke faster than we could get them to work
ok these are great so far takes forever to arrive or at least feels like when cant see  light and comfortable to wear for long periods
easy to use not bad flavor at all the easier it is to use the more i can take it i have reordered i cant really tell if it works i just keep taking a variety of joint relieve products to maintain flexibility without the pain of arthritis hopefully this and all products for arthritis relief work
nearly every time ive ever purchased rubber  gloves they have either been far too big or too small  the ones in this set absolutely could not fit any betterfrom the fit in the fingers to across the palm and back of the hand to up the arm  these gloves are exactly the right size for methere are 4 pairs of gloves in this set  two sets of gloves that are unlined that feel just like a second skin  providing the ultimate in dexterity while still protecting your hands  and the other two pairs of gloves are flocked with a cotton liner making them not only easier to get on and take off but softer and providing some protection from hot dish wateron both types of gloves the tips of the fingers are reinforced giving extra durability yet still allowing for excellent dexterity and range of motion  the texture on the palm and finger pads aides in being able to grip and hold anything you are working on without any issuethe forearm protection 65  giving the ability to reach down into liquids without the liquid flooding the glove  the total length of the glove is 126these gloves are constructed from pvc polyvinyl chloride and are thus latex free making them excellent for those with a latex allergyi have really put these gloves to the test with the unlined gloves i have worked outside scrubbing metal cabinets with wire brushes and chemicals and have yet to wear through a single pair  i have used the lined gloves as ive cleaned my grill and scoured countless dirty pansthese are the best rubber gloves i have ever seen  i definitely recommend these to those looking for excellent long lasting rubber gloves to protect your hands  this is an outstanding buy
this washin helped restore the water repellency of my favorite nylon shell im not giving it 5 stars because it didnt make the shell totally repellent but maybe thats asking too much it did a very good job doesnt smell or leave a residue and doesnt appear to affect the breathability of the fabric
i am so very upset this product not only took out the ugly dark coffee stains but it ruined the beautiful shiny finish on the inside of my vintage coffee pot if you have a vintage coffee pot do not buy this it will ruin it
fits great looks nice and great price
sounds good not bose quality but good for the price battery lasts for a few nights sleep
i have problems with calloused heels and so i need to do some exfoliation from time to time  ive used the batterypowered emjoi for years but i got tired of replacing the batteries  this one is more convenient more powerful and fasterwarning  be careful  this can very easily grind too much skin off the feet and create a wound  it is best to go easy
so far so good with these capsules ive had no bad side effects and some good so that works well they seem to do wonders for the hair and skin they are said to have antibiotic type effects as well which is always a plus these are rich in antioxidants and the capsules are vegetarian since you are supposed to take one capsule twice a day this is only a one month supply so thats something to consider when deciding if you are going to start a regimen that includes this exact brand of neem seed oil supplement its a good supplement to use and seems to work so it may be worth it
here are some key points in my overall experience smell of the broccoli was stronger than the taste lol so dont be deterred by the smell lol easy way to add some veggies to your diet perfect for putting in smoothies or add to juice i love that this product is organic nongmo and no fillers i wouldve liked to know if this product is raw or cooked and also how much of the powder is one daily serving of veggies overall good experience but hoping they add the above info which i would find very valuable
used it once then tossed it did not curl my lashes
excellent flavor and i know from previous use of a different flavor that these work quite well for my upsets
great tasting way to get vitamin c
have used for years always feel scrubbed clean and easily reaches your back they never mildew or tear replace every 36 months
cleans the air in my car beautifully leaves it freah
this product works perfectly  it does exactly what it says it will do  and its an amazing price  i would recommend this to anyone  i have one for most of my rooms but plan to get two more so that all rooms have it
this is exactly as described  i was nervous it would not be the size described but it is a large size to fit any bulky or thick items for storage  very sturdy construction and the window is a plus
great to clean and sanitize wounds
would recommend these mask over all others i have purchased over the past few years i can chew gum and talk while wearing these mask with no problem
havent used it a great deal yet but i like the idea of a bug guard in lotion form  it is exactly as described  arrived promptly
these are what i was looking for and do what i needed them to do  i am happy with them
frankly we like this product it does not leak all the soap out as the 3m product did and it cleans the dishes just fine the problem is that the sponge head comes loose from the plastic base that holds it on the handle the first one came off in about a week or so and now the second one has done the same the seller is willing to send me a new set and have me return the old set but unfortunately the ups store here is not a regular store and i would need to go 90 miles to a fullservice ups store i will see what alternatives the seller and amazon offer frankly this is a bummer since the product is head and shoulders better than our previous 3m ones if only it would stay glued together
ive been on a mission to try out as many nutrition bars as i can find looking for a combination of good health good taste and reasonable cost after trying virtually all the flavors of a couple dozen different brands these came in second to   the kit bars are a bit more expensive with no subscribe and save option but are healthy tasty and not too sweetwe also like larabars and kind bars but find both too sweetthinkthin crunch have more sodium and less sugar and are soso in tastekashi bars are the cheapest at 50 apiece and the almond flax version are the least sweetmy recent least favorite are coconut simply whey bars with a fairly yucky taste
a little in my morning coffee does the trick
this package contained two household chore gloves one with the cotton lining one without a lining theyre of the large size i usually wear womens large size and these fit well they were easy to pull on and off including the one that did not have cotton lining on the inside they fit close enough and are flexible enough that i could do chores that require some dexterity the gloves cover your hand wrist and part of the lower arm im very pleased with these as i usually have trouble finding gloves that fit well are easy to get on and dont provoke my latex allergy
good price easy to use provides a deep clean for my appliances
replaced original perfect fit the only down fall is that the adjustment stem adjustment pins are not the same as original  no reason why made it work anyway
held up well even in the wind
great product and have used it for years
worked as described
this cleansing brush system is excellent first it comes with a beautiful carrying case it has a huge body brush second it has a blending brush for getting facial creams well blended into your skin which means you you less cream and it is fully absorbed third it comes with a facial brush for deep cleaning your face fourth it comes with a pumice stone as well all this plus its battery operated you really dont need to buy separate gadgets save money and be completely satisfied with this system it truly is a wonderful system and i highly recommend it i bought this with a discount but would gladly pay full price for one for my daughter in a heartbeat
i got this for my father who is advanced in age his feet ache continuously blue emu is the first foot salve that gave him relief he loves this stuff
in my opinion serves the purpose as well as 150 name brand
been using these for almost 3 weeks daily am time and i find myself having more energy for whatever im doing work walkrunningbicycling etc i like the fact that its only two tablets per dosage its also very helpful in removing a lot of water they get to retain in the body which causes bloating excess wateryou can take 2 tablets 13 times perday i find for myself since im high energy and active that 1 time per day works find out whats best for you no crash effect and you feel alert
the bulb gives light which is not as yellowish as standard soft white bulbs improving the readability of written text the bulbs themselves are very compact slightly shorter than a standand incandescent bulb turn on time is less than half a secondthe two bulbs come in a container made of thin cardboard that offers little protection both the original shipment and the replacement shipment each had a broken bulb the bulbs do contain small amounts of mercury which is toxic they probably should be  ordered separately so as to lessen the chance of them being damaged by other items in the shipment and prevent mercury contamination of the other items
barely measured out to 16 nowhere near the 17 as advertised washing element has already starting separating cheap
it seemed like it made it harder to breathe not easier  i returned
this eyelash curler was already charged but failed to get hot after 10 min of being on after trying it on my eyelashes as i pressed on it the plastic cracked i can not recommend shipping was okay
we love the original oreck carpet cleaner  we have purchased different off brand cleaners and they do not work as well as the original oreck
i just received this item and it wont even turn on such a pain to have to return do not waste your money
item was securely packaged and sealed  i use this fragrance in my diffuser to enhance lavender and orange  the smell is nice and as expected
does the job well
love these colors
i bought this squeegee for our shower tiles and glass door it works very well the angle of the handle is adjustable and an extension handle can be installed i bought a handle adapter through amazon so that a short screw on handle can be attached it came with two replacement blades and works very well makes quick work of getting the water off shower tiles and glass
this is the only form of iodine that i can take  not only that years ago i was treated for lyme disease  my heavy metals were tested and my lead and mercury were off the chart  while at an amazing clinic i was also treated with chelation therapy to reduce my heavy metals  by the time i left my lead and mercury were about 12 of what they had been but were still way too high  i came home bought an iv pkg from a local dr but they made me wait 4 months before i could start chelation therapy again  during that time i was taking 57 of these a day to help with my energy  i had read that this can remove heavy metals but how effectively  when the dr finally had time to see me 4 months later and they tested me for heavy metals they were all but gone  this stuff had pulled the rest of them out of my system  the 1000 i paid just had to be used for the occasional vitamin c iv because no one ever refunds money  now the thing about heavy metals is that they can get into every cell so you clean out the blood and other stores will be released  meaning it might take years and years to completely remove all of the heavy metals depending upon how long you had mercury in your mouth how much or how long you were exposed to other things if you are using it for anything other than as an iodine source you might want to have your heavy metals tested to check your progress  i have not had my heavy metals tested in years but this product helps to give me energy and helps me to feel good so i continue to take 35 per day  they are staples in my ever shrinking supplement list
no instructions adjustments very limited do not appear durable uncomfortable do not aid in movement
omg this scent is heavenly bought it once to test if i liked the scent buying three more now if youre buying this brand they usually have free shipping on purchases of 50 the shipping can be expensive so stocking up every few months can save you some  instead of buying one every once in a while
they were exactly what i needed for close sewing work and made all the difference in being able to see to thread the needle
works great
good for the price
next best thing to jets  easy to use and relaxing effect  when rinsing i just hang it vertically on the shower to dry
will take the matte finish off paint though walls and leave shiny spots will slowly remove the shiny surface of tiles but i think it says that on the box still a great tool for when nothing else will work
pretty good still a little chafing when im doing longer runs of 10 miles marathon coming up so i need something for the sports bra area that holds up
i used this when i had walking pneumonia i was still sick for 2 months while using this maybe it works better as a preventative instead of after you are sick
stronger than my old dollar store readers i needed new magnifiers for crafts my old ones got chewed by my puppy i decided to try stronger ones these do the trick and are stronger than what i needed like the fashionable colors i might take a pair to work and keep on my desk this is very handy to have spares i have super high powered ones that only work for jewelry inspection but not very useful the 500 is good for hand work and miniatures
great cases
my family follows a low carb diet these low carb snack bars are quite satisfying i was full for a good couple of hours after eating one they are surprisingly soft and chewable i expected them to be hard and dry but they arent i would rate the taste as in between a 3 and a 4 theyre definitely palatable ive had some bars that ive literally had to force myself to eat i found it easy to eat these youre not going to mistake them for candy or treats these would be easy to keep in your bag or take on the go
the brush is baby soft it does the job but not quite what i had hoped
i used to put a warm washcloth on my face prior to doing extractions its messy and inconvenient and the cloth is only at the right temperature for a short timei like this unit because it delivers the steam that helps open the pore prior to extraction and if that wasnt enough it even includes some extraction toolsso far so good
i bring these with me whenever i travel i recently got back from namibia and botswana cant even tell you how many times i found myself in a bathroom with no soap or in a location with no soap and sink after handling animals or about to eat a mealtheyre so easy to use just be sure that you only use one sheet per hand washing two is too many and youll be stuck trying to get all the extra soap off of your hands
after seeing this oil suggested to remove scars acne fine lines and wrinkles on pinterest i decided to by some and give it a try for myself and it actually met up to my expectations  my skin has not looked better in years
great moisturizer  i  look better already  usually cheaper on ebay though
latest update jan 2018 after 23 years of trying to keep the little feet on the scale from leaving black streaks on the bathroom floor i gave up and threw this scale away  cleaning the feet did not work coating the feet with clear nail polish worked only for a time attaching felt covers on the feet also only worked temporarily  amazing  so relieved to be rid of the bloody thingupdate i removed one star after using this scale for about a year now  the scale rests on little square rubber feet and these little bits of rubber leave black streaks on my tiled bathroom floor every single time i move the scale on the floor  its like the rubber feet are made of soot  i tried cleaning them but no amount of cleaning prevents the feet from leaving black streaks  i finally painted over the feet with clear nail polish top coat  that worked for a while but the top coat apparently wears off after a while  ive had to repaint the rubber feet after a few months  awfulthis is the best bathroom scale i have owned  ever  it is sleek in design easy to read with the bright bluelit background  most importantly it is accurate  my old scale used to give a differenr reading each time i got on it even if it was seconds apart  also this scale uses regular  batteries instead of the hardtofind led batteries the old scale used  i have only had this scale for about 2 weeks but i am really glad  i made the switch  if you are looking for an easytoread accurate scale i recommend this one
this has truly saved my life i use this twice a day to clean my eyes and eyelids and it truly has been a lifesaver i was struggling terrifically with dry eye syndrome until my doctors advice nurse suggested i try this i cant live without it
the cart is well made with long handle for easy movement i only give it 4 stars because the wheels are not tough enough for daily  city use i had to change the wheels with lawn mower replacement wheels and now nothing can stop in my everyday use why arent more being sold
so far so good charges my batteries so i always have back up
its alright didnt notice anything but tingling i got this stuff the bustboosting solution and so far ive seen awesome results thought id share
each mint is about 7mg of caffeine but it feels much more powerful than that im not sure which flavor i like more they are all very good
i have these on my amazon subscriptionwhen it comes to supplements sometimes even top brands are adulterated independent studies have shown that often what you think you are getting isnt what youre gettingamazon says these are tested and since ive had very good luck with most amazon branded products i trust them
just what i desired great smell
too hard missing the softer outer layer my chiropractor told me to buy this one but this is cheaper than the one he has its missing the outer roll totally unusable for me
i like that the straws come individually wrapped since i probably wont be drinking boba tea on a daily basis and these will end up getting thrown and knocked around in a kitchen drawer perfect size for bubble tea pearls
these gloves work really well and they are an extremely timesaving efficient means to dust both mini blinds and knickknacksthis product is a pair of gloves and i wear both at the same time one on each hand to dust a handy plus is that once one side of the gloves gets too dusty you can switch the gloves to opposite hands in order to reverse the gloves so that you are dusting with a clean side in order to continue dusting and get twice as much use out of the gloves before washing themyou can throw these gloves into the washer on cold gentle cycle but you need to air dry them i have so far washed them by hand in order to make them last longerhighly recommended
this higher dose will provide me with twice as much omega 3 than my previously used brand i am glad i was able to find this extra strength supplement im looking forward to seeing how this extra strength dosage will affect me highly recommended
i like this item because i can carry one packet or all of them  the only difficulty can be opening the packet  if your hands are stiff i would not buy this item because the handles you use to open the packet are small
i like many others was a little taken back when i opened the bottle to see that there was a baggie inside holding the vitamins that was oddthe pills themselves are banded together just like in the description so that wasnt a big deal for me i havent noticed a difference but i have had no side effects either there is no bad after taste and they are easy to swallow
its okay but dries out easy
i have read a lot about magnesium deficiency and its a real conundrum people die of heart attacks from it but most forms of magnesium cant be taken in high enough doses to quickly build magnesium levels without causing diarrhea i have experimented with taking different amounts of this product and have had no problem with abdominal cramping or diarrhea this is one of the few breakthroughs in the world of supplements
used once so far and worked well
xxl is barely large enough im 67 but even so it does physically encourage my back and shoulders toward proper alignmenti had concerns about the smell vender reached out to me and explained that it will dissipate the dissipation may take longer if its left in a colder environment such as my garage in winter
what fun my daughter and granddaughters are in roller derby so they can go a little crazy with their hair for bouts this is nice quality hair chalk with vivid colorsa virtual palette thats unbeatable
these are really cute just sturdy enough to stuff not so tough the kids cant get into them
wouldnt wear it
to be fair i have a very old ace bandage that i was replacing so newer ones may have already improved over the years regardless this is a nice package of 4 wraps with 2 clips each and at least 2 extra included which was a nice touch seeing as how those always tend to bendbreak at the teeth or get lost altogether the material had a good feel and a really nice stretch to it vs my older one so long as these hold up through a few uses i would definitely purchase them again if they do not hold up reasonably well ill update this review
compared to other products like this ive read many reviews and compared many products i havent fully tested and used this product yet but i have high hopes in that it will help i have a few weeks before i can really test how well this works in addition to other detox methods and changes in my diet and exercise routines i took a chance on this product and hopefully it will helpupdate 1013i wanted this product to work in fact i got the second bottle for free and took the pills for 2 weeks straight so i had really high hopes that it would work i just tested myself before my real test tomorrow and my results are positive after having not smoked for over 2 weeks and then using these pills for the last 2 weeks straight the bottle claims to work within a week and it hasnt worked for me for 2 weeks of use just disappointed that i wasted my time and money taking 6 pills a day for 2 weeks guess im going with my last resort which was an additional detox drink before my real test hopefully that will work dont bother with this if it doesnt work for me in 2 weeks i cant understand how some people got results in 1 such a let down
no complaints at all about these probiotics the potency is very good with each capsule providing 25 billion cfus the recommended dosage is 2 caps per day for a total of 50 billion cfus the strain diversity is excellent with a total of 14 strains the strains are identified but the specific concentration of each is not it also includes a small amount 5mg per capsule of a prebiotic fos to help with probiotic establishment the bottle i received in may 2021 has an expiration date of july 2022it hits the mark for both potency and strain diversity and the price for a 60 capsule bottle is quite reasonable performance has been very good for me and ive not had any stomach issues such as gas or bloating when taking them before a meal very pleased and a solid 5 stars
these are very nice essential oil rollons you get a total of 4 different blends in this little relaxation kits the tranquility  blend is a mix of vetiver cedarwood and chamomile it is a very nice woodsy aroma that smells great the piece out blend is a mi of lavender orange and bergamot probably my favorite it is a beautiful blend that is just perfect to apply before you head to bed tension is a blend that contains peppermint and wintergreen and to be honest i am not a huge fan to that one mostly because i am rather sensitive to mind ache is the last one and contains arnica and frankincense to help with inflammation bruising and sprains that one smells a bit rougher but it is supposed to help with inflammation and does seem to help maybe a little bitthat one is applied directly to the affected area while tension is applied best to the temples since it helps with headaches a little bit the other two can be applied to the temples or pulse points to distribute their effects these are easy to apply and use their scents are pretty mild and sadly do fade fairly quickly all considering i like that they come in these easy little applicator rollons that are easy to bring along really all in all nice little set that also makes for a good gift
this supplement has a lot of very good ingredients the dosage per day is two pills they dont have a horrible smell butthese are so big  i have trouble swallowing pills at all and the big ones are a struggle if they even go downi looked at the ingredients list everything is good but honestly id buy this supplement if they just put the bottom half of the list in them the top half can be had in so many multi vitamins that already exist no need to duplicate those when it is the bottom of the list id be interested in the most the subsequent pill could then be smaller as welloverall not bad but not worth it for a onemonth supply that mostly duplicates a decent multivitamin
calsules were easy to swallow and no bad taste to the capsules
works but loses shape quickly
not sure if this is working but it is plugged in next to the bed i guess it is mental the big one we got for the room works for sure
this is easy to adjust and fits pretty well it definitely helps my posture immensely they even sent a resistance band and link to exercises which was nice
i love derma nu products in general and i have used many of their items this toner is no exception to their quality products first of all it smells divine a very soft natural rose smellnot in the old fashioned sense but soft and natural it is more like a fresh blossom on the vine it is very gentle to the skin and works well to cleanse as well as tone the skin when just sprayed lightly over your skini would highly recommend this toner especially if you have dry or sensitive skin its really a perfect toner for these skin types i have used everything from high end to drug store and i have found derma nu products to be among the very best available and they are also very affordable here on amazon i hope this helps if this review is helpful to you please click yes so it can be helpful to others as well thank you so much for reading
my honeys 40th birthday is coming up and i cant wait to put this on the roller for his birthday  the images on it are vibrant and easily visible just like pictured here  its going to be great and a funny start to his day
i like keeping these in the office for those mid afternoon hunger cravings
i have reordered this and also ordered other products from this company great quality
beautiful color and sweet scented soap  i love the horse in motion that they captured in making this
nice bag for walker mother in law loves it well made
we bought these and a couple other types by far these are the best in others the inner lining was too lose after the first wash to breath easily these are very soft material but also thick enough to wear for the pandemic my son is a smaller 6 year old and its a tiny bit lose by his cheeks but otherwise fits well
i originally gave this a 3 star review because i thought it was too heavy  and i ordered a buckwheat  rice wrap  although this is heavier than the other one  the reality is that compariatively they are very close i guess when shoulders are sore they are more sensitive  i find myself reaching for this one because of the capelike design  it distributes the heat where i need it  im giving it 5 stars although if there was a 45 option id probably pick that  i wish there was a way to have the contents shift around less maybe some internal sections if that would work with also needing to shift the beads around when nuking them to distribute the heat  not sure if the physics of that but if a couple strategically placed compartments were possible that would improve this  i think the fill to internal space ratio is very good so dont add more beads i like to nap with this and dont like to nap with the buckwheat one because it is too thick and wont flatten outbelow is original for referencevery very heavy  this is much heavier than i realized even though i read the other comments  its really too heavy for me  im going to keep it as it is as advertised at least i think so i didnt think it held heat as long as they said but i only nuked it for the 1 minute  i will use it sometimes but will need to be careful with it and only use it for short period of time because of the amount of compression the weight puts on my shoulder  im using it because of an issue in an arm that is affecting shoulders and i want my lymph fluid to flow freely  i am going to need to purchase something else lighter  maybe the buckwheat filled warmer like i was originally looking for
liked this powder  it is as described  arrived on time
terrible i have size 12 feet these inserts were at least 4 sizes to small they were also paper thin spend the extra money for odoreaters or comparable
this product is amazing for cleaning the boat it gets off any pesky spots and makes getting those tough spots clean a breeze we will never use anything else
the mountain falls ultra sunscreen is a very affordable alternative to the big name brand sunscreens the first thing i noticed about this sunscreen is that the scent is pretty mild it does have the typical smell that goes along with products containing sunscreen but its not very strong at all in fact its barely noticeable when you first open the lid of it it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and doesnt leave any greasiness behind it seems to do a good job of protecting as long as you remember to reapply it regularly  every year i cringe at the prices of sunscreen out there this is a noncringe worthy comparable product
perfect for our at home tanning bed in our cleveland browns basement
my wife said it smells like 34old man34  not a great fragrance and rather strong  but good at preventing body odor
they do the trick
it makes good shakes and love the fact i can put my pills and protein powder in their too shaker is super useful good size and you can bring in it everything you need for your before and after workout the word can wash of the bottle
i am very impressed with the quality of these bags  they are at the same level as hallmark and for a much lower price  several of the bags have a 3 dimensional aspect to them  they have a nice ribbon handle and attached gift tag as well
removes all kinds of organic stains good for cradle to old age i dont mean the product is organic just that it removes non chemical stains
these are wonderful trash bags  they have a rubbery feel to them and are very stretchy  they easily fit over our standard size kitchen garbage can with no fighting necessary to get it stretched over the top rims  they dont come with wire ties and arent designed with flaps to tie so if you over fill it you really have to mash the trash down to get enough bag to tie together or buy some wire ties separately
i was really glad it was already assembled im glad i got the wood instead of the plastic it is well made and should last for a long time i thought it would take a while for my body to adjust to the positioning of the legs but to my surprise it worked just like the said it would im thinking about purchasing one for my mom the real trial will come if i have problems going im glad i got it
does the job its supposed to do good purchase  wish the handle was a little bit longer
great product no complaints
i use this to teach patients how to do self mobs and send it home with them works great wide band and string claspe
this tool works amazingly  i am a diabetic  this works perfect to remove all the dried skin that can cause infections on my feet  the speed is very appropriate  easily cleaned  speed is very consistent with it being electrical which i prefer
terrific product at a great price  large spray bottle does a great job on all my glasses including my new titanium carbon glasses  received on time and very well packages
bought this from granddaughters baby shower registry this is what i used for all my childrens laundry many years ago so glad to see its still around   its perfect for babys delicate skin is hypoallergenic
love the variety  little large but good
i have been looking for a nicer and easier alternative for a travel toothbrush and this fits the bill it comes with an extra toothbrush head which makes it even more convenient for travel when it is both my husband and myself the silver case is a nice touch too there are alternate colors available if silver isnt your thing the bristles on the toothbrush are soft and gentle on the gums all you have to do is carefully fill the toothpaste area and you are done there is a small hole in the middle of the bristles that lets the toothpaste out i appreciate that there is a cleaning stick so i can remove any residual toothpaste if i am not going to use it for awhilei did receive this product for free but my reviews are always honest
very practical
savory chicken tasted awfuland to top it off product couldnt be returned  big ripoff
there are 12 individually wrapped smal bath bombs in this set the fragrances are orange lavender frankincense rosemary mint lemongrass vanilla seasalt kiwi rose coconut and papayai tried the papaya when it was first plunged into the water see video there was fizz and no suds before i could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later see photo also the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the packagesince i personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath i used this in a foot bath the water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bathin summary these bombs perform terribly are staining and are barely fragrant in the bath the current price of 1999 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to 167 per bath bomb which is about what i would expect to pay for bombs of this size however at that price i also expect these to perform and they do not these are super lackluster and an utter disappointment i am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars i doubt the other reviewers even tried this in the bath in the box they look impressive but if they had used at least one they most likely would not be so impressed
i got some of this at an online naturalorganic foods shop and unlike every other kind of untraditional noodle i have ever cooked my husband and son both ate this and liked it i had made pasta with garlic and cheese for me and they ate my snackits good the noodles are thin and the texture is nice they taste good and they take the flavor of the sauce you use but they dont become the flavor of the sauce the way say shiritaki noodles dofour servings to a bag and when they cook up theres a lot tons of fiber in these as well 11gserving i think
overall for 11 is okaywe didnt use the adhesive that comes with it because it was obvious it was not going to work so we use normal double side tape 3mmfaster and less complicated
i like the style of kf94 masks they fit my face the best and are comfortable for me to wear all day if necessary these masks are made in china they are individually wrapped in plastic bags which i prefer i keep backup masks in my car and bag and this way i know the masks are clean until i need to use onethese masks have smaller ear loops than other kf94 masks i have used for me the smaller ear loops are good  i have a petite face and the small ear loops help me get a tight fit over my cheeks and chin if you have a larger face the small ear loops might not be a positivethe masks have the expected nose clip but above the nose clip the masks have a vshaped cutout in theory the vshaped cutout should help the top of the mask fit better against the sides of your nose since its not a straight line like most masks but for me the sides of the cutout stand away from my nose so theyre right at the bottom of my view and i worry they are a spot for air to slide in and out of the mask since they arent tight against my face
helped with recent surgery works as expected
i first learned of dmso from our teenage sons college running coach  as an athlete who runs over 100 miles a week our kid was frequently dealing with pains and injuries from his workouts  when knee or ankle pain didnt ease up after a few days and serious injury had been ruled out by orthopedists the trainers would break out the dmsosince then ive used it on my own runninginjured knee occasionally when the pain becomes too bad  after applying the area remains wet and a bit sticky for about 2030 minutes remember to wash your hands thoroughly after rubbing it in  after this amount of time you can wipe off any excess that hasnt been absorbed by your body  during this time the area usually becomes warm a bit rosy and itchy  i also get a garlic taste in my mouth which is typical for most people  for those people who use it frequently their bodies can begin to emit a garliclike odor in their sweatdmso is a byproduct of paper making and is primarily used as an industrial solvent for herbicides fungicides antibiotics and plant hormones  its had experimental use orally as treatment for certain types of cancer  at this time it does not have the approval of the fda for use on humans other than as a specific physicianprescribed treatment for bladder disordercancer  it is fda approved for use on horses and dogs and is widely used in that industryits important to note that the face and neck are more sensitive to dmso and no higher concentrations than 50 should ever be applied there  also when applying dmso to your skin its important that the skin is totally clean dry and unbroken because dmso penetrates the body  as it penetrates dmso can carry any chemical that has a molecular weight of up to 1000 units right through the skin and into the body into the blood stream and even through the bloodbrain barrier it also leaves the skin more permeable than normal for a few hours there is a possibility that chemicals such as the dye from clothing in contact with dmsotreated skin could be accidentally passed through the skin and carried directly into the bodywhile i do generally experience pain relief when i use dmso i usually save it for when my knee is at its worst
quit working after a few months waste of money
so much more comfortable than the elastic bands that hurt my ears after a lwhile
nothing special the pennant flag banner is seethrough plastic and doesnt look as nice as whats in the picture
the instructions were a bit sparse about how to set the range of motion limits but i was able to figure it out in a minute or twoi ordered a medium im size 9 mens and it was too bigits actually quite uncomfortable to walk in as the sole is very thick and my specific injury did not allow for the range of motion that would have made this comfortable
this was from the second or third batch we purchased  they work so well and are actually so comfortable weve occasionally forgotten to take them off
i bought this because i have arthritis and my tailbone hurts after a short time in any chair i was hoping for pressure relief but this is so hard my backside hurts just the same also its very large i was hoping that a pillow large enough to cover any chair would be a plus but it has hard square sides that dig into my legs and its too high i find i cant sit all the way back in the chair and dont get any back support because of the size of this pillowim glad i tried out the pillow so now i can stop thinking about buying the bed now i have to figure out how to return this because it wasnt shipped from amazon and i didnt keep the outer box
hilarious  great paper too
excellent quality mesima from an excellent company bag comes full of product and is exceptional i plan to encapsule mine or use some as tea i have not yet run out of my other bag yet so i am taking that i am taking for my brain tumor and seizures and to help slow the  process of my brain cancer or perhaps cure it but as i have the type that always comes back is like to say that im probably going to be talking this and many other medicinal mushrooms for a while thank you for all your hard work for an amazing product
last summer we had a chance to travel to asia i bought this product for my kid to use while we travel over there it worked very good it prevented the kid from mosquito bite the smell was mild
great for travel everyday use of medicationswell made easy to use
45 bought these because all of the groomers were booked up for a long time after covid closings these arrived promptly within two days they worked well on my little dog it also came with extras scissors nail file great bargain
small leaves less mess but dont do it drive you get headbox instead of razor bumps
greatest pot holder ever  love the colors available
really are they kidding us okay i had to admit that i got taken by the commercial i never get taken well hardly ever captain corcoran liked to say by these things but i also have lots of quotscuff marksquot around the house on walls doors railings etc plus oven gunk that needs to be cleaned off its that second part that really made me try this since it talked about how great this works on stove tops and ovens yeah right the quoteraserquot is a flimsy spongelike material that does nothing and unlike even the cheapest sponge it does not hold up to even the most gentle rubbing on any surface you are supposed to wet it and then rub it on the stain or dirt or gunk however if you try that even on a slick wall it falls apart in your hands its like trying to clean your cars exterior with kleenex and even if you can rub it over a surface gently and keep it in one piece it has absolutely no ability to clean none you would do better to spit on your fingers and rub them on the surface and at least your fingers dont disintegrate and you dont have to feel really stupid to have fallen for this con by quotmr cleanquot and thrown money down the drain by the way never let this go down the drain since it clogs it i used to love the mr clean commercials as a little boy and had a neighbor who looked just like the bold mascot so when id go to the supermarket with my mom i always told her she should buy dome but my mom always laughed and told me that the product itself was totally useless yes everyone always listen to your mother stay away from this money wasting useless crap
ordered these crutches for my sistershe spent over 15000 for crutches that where less quality which broke in little timeshe is walking a little easier now and more they are comfortable for her armsthanks so much for not ripping people off with higher prices
love it but wish it had a suction to stick to the shower wall
didnt keep the smell at bay for long
been using for two weeks and havent got anything to report yet will update after 30 days
gets the job done but you have to use two at once to get any meaningful coverage  i rather the company just make half and give us bigger sizes
the lemon lime sport go electrolyte powder is very high in carbs36 of them in fact for athletes marathoners and long distance bikers this is an excellent choice to rehydrate and get that extra burst of energy from carbs for the rest of us who are not into sports it works darn well when you have the flu or some other illness that depletes your hydration and energy i generally will have my hubby get me powerade gatorade or any of the other replenishing brands when i am sick not eating and having gastric issues this could literally help you through the rough times same thing when you are out in the hot sun and need to keep hydrated i am keeping this handy as one of my go tos when i am having issues
the rolls are a bit smaller than you probably would expect but the tp is just fine
i like the creamy one better than the gel one  but  dmso use has kept me knee bracesupport free every day except for extreme hiking days for the past close to 2 months
i have a medium size and love it on the plane  my husband isnt as fond of it  but then he doesnt like neck ties either  i think it beats any pillow that wraps around your neck
my daughter loves this
i had hoped for the outfit to fit more nicely then it did but its ok however not as good as it looks but fair for the price
the worst razor i have ever tried this unit would not cut peach fuzz would never buy from this outfit again
i mostly got this because i wanted to remove the fuzz from my cheap but sturdy fleece leggings and none of the attachments did the trick  it worked well on my wool sweaters though so ill keep it but its not a miracle cure for every fuzz or pill
exactly like the stuff i bought from my physical therapists office works perfectly
ordered 60 count received 30 count should have ordered straight from granite supplements
i love journaling and i am a stickler for paper feel i was hoping the pages of this nicely bound hardcover journal would have a smoother and softer feel but it is more like sketchbook or book paper with a rough and scratchy feel its just okay but not my favorite if you found this review to be helpful at all please take a moment and click the button below to let amazon know thank you so much
theyre ok i probably wont be buying anymore they slide around and do not stay in place many many times i had to adjust the cloth in my underwear so for heavy days these would be a disaster as the mess would slide all around too the stains came out with washing though i did have to scrub and scrub right away
cheaply made within 2 days it fell off
didnt work on my teeth just made them sensitive
i was a little concerned when i first received this as the powder alone does smell kind of funky but i found that i was able to mix it in with my coffee or tea with no discernable tastesmell i like that this contains a lot more diverse types of collagen than more normal collagen powder i like that this product is sustainably sourced and i really like that this brand takes a holistic approach to skincare that includes supplements which i feel are so important ive been using a few of their products now for a couple of weeks and feel like i am receiving the benefit of their synergistic approach
i always sleep with a mask and ive had so many different stylesbrands this is by far the most comfortable mask ive ever used its soft and lightly padded which feels good on my eyes and it has a little material that blocks out 100 of the light if its adjusted right the best thing is the little metal buckle to adjust the strap isnt right behind my ear which most masks it is and it hurts when i sleep on my side this one is pain free and perfect im tempted to order a couple more as backup for the day when i wear this one out
these are worthless they dont fly at all and barely spin when an adult tries to make it spin so theres little chance for a child to have any kind of fun with these
because of health issues i have to be very conscious of getting enough protein and this product is great to use in many ways i have concocted a frozen mixture which i keep on hand at all timesthis protein boosts the grams and also boosts the flavoring my favorite
i like this twixflavored protein  the collagen powder in this protein product really does help with the granularity but it does mean that a blender rather than a fork or spoon is your mixing tool of choice  its very smooth when made and it has a good enough flavor on its own that you wont need to supplement your supplement drink with anything but like most chocolate products a little banana or peanut butter goes a long way towards making this more of a shake and less of a drinkno matter how you like it though i think youll find its good
this scale doesnt really work properly it doesnt lock on the weight when it is done i suppose i should send it back but its not worth the shipping money in order to get a new one
they slip around on nose pad quite big
very irritating to my scalp threw away
this is the best callus remover tool i have tried so far it comes with a box of 80 sanding pads and one pad can last several uses depending on what you have going on on the bottom of your feet i tried it for the first time last night and my feet have never been softer i have used chemical callus remover i have a giant foot rasp that removes dead skin i have the manual foot sanders you name it ive tried it  but this thing beats all of them my heels are currently just as soft as my toddlers feet and im 40 years old the place where i get my pedicures done uses this tool as well but they only use it on your feet for 5 seconds slap some lotion on and theyre done i used it on thick problem areas for quite some time with dry feet and it really got it all off it will stop if you press too hard but resumes as soon as you decrease that a little anyway money well spent
a great addition to almost any bakery mix especially good combined with capella popcorn
does just what it says it does love it gonna order another one right now
lots of fun
good fit
i had an expensive tens unit the dr prescribed via a medical supply company for years i wasnt sure how well this would measure up after that one finally gave up after years and years of use but this one is amazing and even better
these are durable for moderate use i use them for a variety of home use from cleaning to kitchen work the only time i ever have issues with them is if its my fault the sizing is perfect and what always works for me in other brands
daughter updated her room and these look great on her dresser
exactly as advertised  easy to use  works well
this is the fourth product like this that i have tried two of them did nothing one gave minimal positive results but this is amazing im into my second order and each time ive taken it it has worked as advertised i had to only give a five star rating but would like to give it a six because thats what its given mewill be buying more
i have tried many jojoba oils and this one is bar far the best  helped with discoloration on my arm  the packaging was very good and delivery was sooner than expected  have recommended this oil to my friends
eeasy to use tastes good and works great use it daily at work
i have been taking this religiously for more than a week and so far i have noticed that is may be the reason for my regularity being more reliable i cant speak towards the aiding with any weight loss as yet nor do i know what this products targeted time frame is for the price it truly does bring value towards aiding with my digestive system i would consider it an added bonus if i can shed a pound or two as well it has not caused me any new discomforts due to use so that is always a good thing no side effects for me as with all things everyones body make up is different so just because it works for some doesnt always guarantee the same results for all
ive used the pour on version of this for several years on my gas commercial type stove  this was after cleaning it by hand several times with everything else on the market and a straight razor blade to scrape off residue  then came carbon off  its miraculous  what used to take me hours now takes only minutes with some down time while it soaks  my most important hint involves use of water dont  water deactivates the chemicals so if you put it on a a wet surface or start playing with it with a wet sponge youve just stopped the cleaning power  found this the hard way  i used to have to find a restaurant supply shop to buy it but now that its available on amazon its a no brained five star all the way
this is so easy to use and great for keeping wet hair up and out of the way
these came beautifully packaged and would make a great gift send me some really  they are surprisingly large bath bombs and my bath felt really luxurious when using these  i have sensitive skin and had no issues probably the only downside was smelling great and having moisturized skin attracted some chiggers to my bare legs at the fair  lol seriously  they were jacuzzi safe no issues and i definitely plan to use more of these bath bombs in the future five stars all the way  treat yourself
i like the idea that its natural im able to stave off hunger with only 3 per day and im eating healthier
ive been taking these for a few weeks now the capsules are on the large size but easy to swallow with no odor they are vegan caps and are very cleanby that i mean that they are not full of preservatives they are made in the usa tooi see on the manufacturer page that its stated that the product is tested for quality  and i would like to see these nsf certified
works well my dad was pleased
great price perfect fit for all masks with filter inserts best tyle and materials for extra protection highly recommend
so easy and i love the catch basin that holds the remaining pill parts
this is great for those who can t bend over to put on shoes the telescopic handle is great and locks in place so it wont fold up on you until you want it to
this is the second keychain in this style i have owned i really prefer this one to my other this one is made of neoprene type fabric so it stretches better than the canvas type and puts less stress on the zipper it comes with 8 58 dram amber vials with orifice reducers and lids so you can fill them with your essential oils about 30 drops of oil fit into each bottle you can use smaller vials as well and i have found you can it a few even larger vials i have a few 012 oz amber bottles that fit in the four center slots youll want label stickers so you remember what you put in each bottle and those do not come with the keychain the pouch keeps the glass bottles safe and well protected i definitely recommend this keychain for having oils on the go
the three cuts start to tear away from each other after around 100200 swings additionally there isnt enough weight to properly keep the mat in placenext time im just going to spend the money on a larger heavier duty practice mat
smells yummy and i love the towel thank you
i really like this ill buy it again when the time comes
ok product for covering eyes kind of small though
nice nail files  they are really pretty  its kinda hard to tell which side is rough and which is fine  but they get the job done
passes the freeze test so far so good but only a blood test will tell me how it actually works stay tuned for the results
i use this product in everything from smoothies to oatmeal to pumpkin custard for extra protein i highly recommend the paleo egg white protein
i use dial soap because it does the best job of fighting odor particularly during the summer when its so hot and humid in the south  leaves me feeling clean and fresh rinses well nice fragrance  really like the mountain fresh fragrance but hard to find
they last longer them most cr123 batteries
everyone loves it i got it for my sons wheelchair everyone sees it and want to try it they all love itgrateful to get this one insurance is taking forever to get a new cushion this is very nice and affordable
works great for legs too
perfect size for travel
fairly good case sturdy seems to be put together well  needs a little more headroom above the bottles for reference books papers etc  i am always afraid my bottles will leak so do not use the handle  needs a handle to carry flat
i am a certified aromatherapist and i really enjoy exposing these companies that are selling fraudulent essential oils  first of all the price should give it away sandalwood is endangered now and in many countries you are strictly limited on harvest hence why its so priceythe smell is hideous to me it also failed the oil blot test i use to check essential oils from unknown brands  the danger in using these oils is that because they are not sandalwood you cant possible get the therapeutic benefits you would expect  many companies and now taking cheaper essential oils and combining them to smell like something else others are just using chemicals i dont know which category this falls into but it is not sandalwood essential oilwalk away
we do not have mosquitos here where i live but we do get bites from chiggers blister beetles black ants red ants gnats and spiders i am especially prone to chigger bites and  was hoping this product would help with them since the itching is almost unbearable  but it did not help at all with the chigger bites  it does however help the itching with other insect bites
i found this so hard for me to use maybe once i get use to it it is hard to get my hair into the chamber and hard to let my hair out
so far this is not working very well for me  the wrap itself appears well made is easy to put on and comfortable  the instructions are awful and it takes a bit of time to figure out how to use it  apparently the manufacturerdistributor is aware of this and sent me an email informing me if it didnt work they would replace it  so the question is what is it supposed to do  using the 34red34 setting for intensity and time and waiting for 15 minutes to warm up i could barely feel any heat only slight warmth not very therapeutic over the course of 30 minutes or so  maybe for the price thats about all one should expect  ill be shopping for a better one4118 update  after periodic use of the wrap i am changing my rating from two stars to four stars because after use i discovered the heat is adequate although it could be a little hotter  the major problem as noted by others is the control  it remains unclear how to keep the wrap in the warmest red mode and as another reviewer noted you have to keep checking to make sure it hasnt switched to cooler white or blue modes  i suspect there may be a way to eliminate this problem but with such poor documentation it is impossible so far to keep it working correctly  in summary this is a nice well made wrap that attaches to the knee well  if the cord was longer and the controls worked better this could be a very good wrap for applying heat to the knees4818 update  after continued use i am changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars  i have found that when tightly wrapped which is easy to do because of the softness flexibility and large velcro attachments using the red setting hottest it heats to a very comfortable temperature the setting controls could be improved or maybe better instructions should have been provided  this is what i am now doing  after pressing the large plastic square control button for a second or two colortemp is selected i press it when it lights red this is the hottest setting it also has two lower oneswhite and blue  after a few minutes the setting changes to a cooler white or blue color  i then repress the red and it stays at this settingtemp until i turn it off  it really works well provides a very comfortable warm pleasant temp and fits very well over the kneearea
first it caught my eyes because the price range is attractive but after use found out water leaks slowly from the side not sure if it is defect only from this particular product or in general otherwise the outlook is cute and we absolutely love it
these may work fine for you for me if i put a little too much tension on the strap attachment points they fold and release the mask
this works great guides on without tugging and the color isnt too dark i cannot find this in the store so happy to find it here
this product did not work on anything i tried it on
lets just sayit work for everything that magnesium is needed for it works especially since its in a higher dose form were already all so deficient in it might as well get a higher dose
frankly the price has kept me away from this purchase for years cant afford more than onebut put on the lamp we use the most what a wonderful difference for arthritic fingers  now we can turn lamp onoff without pain  so worth it
love this planter i put it outside and attached it to my fence with zip ties dill and potatoes are thriving even in the texas heat
this is a very nice for the  shaver that has multiple functions  the kit includes the following accessories1 rotary nose trimmer2 eyebrow trimmer  comb3 shaving head4 beard  sideburns trimmer  guard5 cleaning brushafter opening the box and reviewing the instructions i tested each of the available accessories  all work as expected  my husband tested the nose hair trimmer and said it was effective and easy on the nose  i was able to remove all of the pesky hairs on my chin using the shaver head and it was perfect  resulted in a smooth shave and no razor bumps  the eyebrow comb was easy to use and did the job  i definitely will use this when i am traveling as it is convenient and compact  this will also make a great gift for others  the heads are easy to remove  a counter clockwise twist and the accessories interchange  the unit does not come with a aa battery  only one battery is required  overall this shaver is a good buy  the shaver seems to be made of quality materials and is perfect for those annoying hairs that seem to appear as you get older
helps with a callus that i have cushion works well doesnt slip around either  easy to clean and very durable
i generally like to use my bento box and glass containers but i do like these amazon brand  solimo plastic food storage containers with lids the feel of the storage container is comparable to brand name containers the lid stays secure they are a decent size the plastic isnt bendy it can be reused a few times even though it does indicate that it is bpafree i do like to stay to a limit on reuse and the container seems durable enough for at least 5 reuses i should also add that i generally do not reheat in the container so if one reheats on a separate plate which i prefer it extends the use it is also has a pretty good price point in that it is around 90 cents per container it is worth a look if you like containers like this style
works better than any other motion sickness medication always take on cruises
these silk sleep masks are soft and stay on without being too tight i only use a sleep mask when traveling to help reduce light and to signal that i dont want to be disturbed  i find these sleep masks to effectively block out the light
i love this product it works so quickly and it does a good job of removing wrinkles from my clothing which i never iron
this set was adorable and perfect on my sister in law the jeweled safety pin for the sash was just the sprinkle on top so cute
this thing is horrible  i can get over the fact that it didnt fit my hair dryer  i had to cut it to get it over the dryer nozzle but the dang think kept blowing off my head  i had to sit the dryer on the arm of the chair so that i could hold the bonnet on  finally i gave up and tied a walmart bag around my head and cut a whole in for the dyer  i played with this thing for over 30 minutes  since i cut it i cant return it but very disappointed
i wear these at the gun range they do ok
nice lumbar support for my computer chair
good simple designgood price
since we installed provenza oil finished floors i wanted to ensure that they were maintained the way the manufacture recommended i use this product because that is what the manufacture recommends but it is extremely pricy in my book  the product separates quite a bit and yes i know you are supposed to shake it but at times i wish i had one of those paint can shaker machines to shake the product up  i get a good workout with all the shaking required  id like to find an alternative to the product
doesnt work this product didnt help to extract any blackheads i dont know if its because my face is too oily but honestly this stuff is as effective as you doing a diy egg white mask straight up no matter if i applied one layer or 5 it seemed as if it dried around my pores and it was so liquid and drippy it was basicall elmers glue with black food coloring that is what is smelled like and that is what it felt like save your money on this one folks
my ice strap is for my back  it came with these small thin packs that look like those kids popsicles most of them after about a years use busted  leaked these are much thicker  hold their freeze point muuuuch longer great buy
used them as cake dowels as recommended by sharon zambito they are so much easier to cut than wooden ones
put out a foggy cloud of albuterol  you can see by my picture the medicine flows quickly and fine fine misti put in 2 double a batteries and it was ready to go this will be so easy to take with me when i go on vacation this handheld little machine makes me happy the big nebulizer i have is such a pain to drag out and use i will probably never use it again this comes with a usb  cord so you can plug in if you dont have batteries
this is a fun way to curl your eyelashes just be careful
who doesnt love petroleum jelly its great for a number of things  this one works well doesnt have any smell which i like and is amazon brand great price on here i highly recommend
i bought these on a whim and took them as directed seemed to do the trick as far as a cleanse
great product soft
i have this a one star only because it didnt catch all my sweat and i must have a weirdly shaped head because it never stayed on i do think this a good concept just didnt work for me
these were the first led lamps ive ever purchasedwe have a ceiling fan in our family room and for some reason both filament bulbs and cfls were burning out quickly within 3 months in one of the four sockets this despite the fact that we dont use the fan all that much also this particular fixture gets a lot of use in our home the lights not the fan so if i could save energy on lighting this application struck me as an opportunity to achieve the greatest payback on the investmentthese bulbs have a small footprint not much bigger than a normal incandescent lamp this was important because they had to fit inside the diffuser globes like most led lamps they send most of the light out the top in a ceiling fixture with four sockets this behavior is not at all objectionable but might be a problem with a reading lamp or other singlebulb fixturethe four bulbs draw a lot less power yet throw noticeably more light than cfls with the same lumen rating in fact im getting a lot more light from these lamps than i expected toall led lamps are currently a little pricey but these are a good deal for what they are and they have held up well so far im very happy with them as long as they continue to function they should pay for themselves in a couple of yearsupdate feb 2014  in the last 8 months ive had no problems with these led lamps burning out ive never had that level of success with either filament lamps or with cfls in this ceiling fan fixture just the fact that i dont have to get out a 6foot step ladder every two months has me very happy with this product
comfortable to wear with sandals
two layers so it passes workplace requirements
very relaxing scent  plant therapy is a quality brand
grandson loves dinosaurs and the bath bombs make bath time more fun and he gets a dinosaur prize
i have high arches but have some shoes without any sort of support and so i find slipping in a support like this can help for long term wearing of super flat shoes the appeal of these for me is that due to my high arches and the fact that these come with height adjustment padded pieces i can be sure to create a level of fit and support that is good for my feet these are cut to fit and have additional padding pieces to make for better adjustment in fit feel and support they fit well in shoes sneakers boots and do well staying in place i will consider buying these again
these are nice makeup removal pads you get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution and of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads these makeup pads are very nice and work well the removal solution is very gentle probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredientsthey smell very good and i found are gentle enough to use around the eyes i had no issues removing foundation lipsticks are eye makeup all in all i am very happy with these the price is rather reasonable too at 12 for 70 of these pads i think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant but since these are gentle enough to use around the eyes they should be good for sensitive skin
i got this to use instead of a regular bulb nasal aspirator i thought i might have more luck with a different one this worked ok not very impressed with its ability to remove mucus from my daughters nose i feel like this wasnt much more effective than wiping her nose with a tissue because it doesnt go that much beyond the nostril
it works alright if you use alot of soap without alot of soap it can drag and pull on the skin it also doesnt make alot of bubbles which can matter to some people the eye hoke makes it much easier to hold onto as when you use alot of soap it gets very slippery
used them at band rehearsal  wow the sound was clear but at a reduced volume so many plugs muffle or modulate the sound to the point where the music is not listenable so far these help to reduce the ringing in your ears they also make a long stem version making it easier to remove this version in not detectable  very discrete go ahead protect your ears
its not the same i used to use scent went from soft and baby powder to almost kind of rank or weird  i feel like this is the new coke  they changed something that wasnt broken  i wont launder anything in it except bath towels and bathmats now  very disappointed as i thought it would give clothes the soft scent that it always gave my daughters clothes  im just going to stick with tide free and clear even tho i was hoping for a little soft scented aroma therapy on pillowcases and sheets
this stuff has been very helpful to me i use it on psoriasis when nothing else helps it calms the itch i also use it on my boxer who has skin issues and ear problems since i bought this ive only had her to the vet for an allergy shot once i will definitely buy it again
this works well with shoes that are a bit larger  if you use this with a fitted shoe  the pressure is worse on the area
this is a 8 ounce bag of powdered amla amalaki they included a 1 teaspoon plastic scoop in the resealable bag and suggest 1 scoop mixed into juice or smoothies ive been using 12 tsp a day in my smoothies using a different brand for over a year this amla powder was what i was expecting in terms of what it looks and tastes like its usda certified organic vegan glutenfree  nongmo im pleased with this product
i really like the saturix 11x16 prep  spill pads as they lay on a surface very flat i have tried household basics like paper towels cotton shop towels and brown paper rolls but they all have a flaw that makes then difficult to use when i am working with products like prepping a model for a very clean mold i cannot introduce lint as i would with cotton towels i have to be aware of chemical compatibilities and paper towels usually contain clay for extra absorbancy and make dust brown paper slides on the surface and does not always help with all spills i felt like i had to choose the lesser of evils these pads are exactly what i have been looking for but simply did not know what they were called i like the  polyethylene backing which can hold up against mild solvents like isopropyl alcohol i appreciate the company also features domestic contact information on the package this is a good sign that customer service for questions and issues are more likely to be addressed i hope my experience is helpful as you kindly will click the button below
bought these as a gift but was able to try them out i think that it was weird but worth trying out
nice light scent for a relaxing bath after work
i really like this eyelash curler of course i wouldnt suggest using any eyelash curler after you have started applying mascara  i use this first and my eyes look more open and mascara added makes my eyes pop
this was for a family member he asked for more so that must mean he is happy
was so excited to receive my eyelash curler in roségold and that the gribs fo not have holes like a scissor also size looked more comfortable than the larger curlersbut so very disappointed product came in cheap plastic box that was part bend when i eagerly unpacked my product i quickly realized that the high looking quality picture does not equal reality the material looks poorhas spots like dents on supposed high polished roségold look but far more important is that the actual curling area is completely crooked lopsided as a customer i dont want to have to fix my product to be able to use it on my eyes and be satisfied with dented plastic looking like material so very disappointed in addition this curler was  8  and not the cheaper curler that one can buy in a local supercenter in person for  276 and is of much higher quality and can actually be used properly again very disappointing frustrating and waste of time and money please see my pics
so to start i understand that isnt the most conventional use for the product but it really works the first picture is the start of my shingles flareup my dad typically uses this product for joint pain but he suggested that i use this on the shingles i got it quickly from amazon and slathered a thick layer of the gel onto the painful liquid filled blisters and bumps i will admit that upon application it burns and tingles but not so bad that its unbearable after a few days the blisters started to dry out a good thing for shingles because it means its healing and after about a week of application to the area the blisters dropped considerably in size and the bumps were almost completely gone i will admit as other have that the only drawback i could see is that it is very drying i noticed that the skin around the bumps and blisters got flakey and dried out i wanted this product to dry the blisters so just be wary if youre using it for pain relief etc
this did things to an old rug i thought not remotely possible  including not animal related spots  i extremely highly recommend
this weighted pencil holder is not a bad product the grip on it is large so if your kid is more comfortable with a bigger pencil to grip its got that covered the outer portion isnt squishy its sort of a sandy grip which isnt a bad thing either the trouble is that you need to attach this using a tiny allen wrench to tension the grip onto the pencil which means that you have to have the wrench out every time the pencil needs sharpening my boys mash their pencils into the paper resulting in many broken pencil tips the allen wrench never gets put away greatly increasing the likelihood that itll be lost there has to be a better way to make this grip adhere to the pencil but other than that its a great device for helping kids that need this kind of aidbe advisedthis listing was not for the kit i only purchase as per the listing the delux grip third from the top its a bit pricey for what you get and ive found a better option so you might want to see if you can find this locally so you can have a look at it before you buy
this product helped me to have bowel movements without my stomach cramping up
only bug spray we will use keeps the bugs off us in the deep woods
love these containerswill buy them again for sure
im a big shopper of silly cheap gadgets and this seemed too good to be true but i gotta say it works made wiping down and cleaning my microwave much easier after using it  would suggest for anyone whos like me and forgets to clean the microwave often and finds an inch thick worth of gunk to clean off
i use this so i can hear my iphone ring over all the equipment running in my shop works great can be turned up to a very loud ear piercing setting just what i needed
the beautiful aroma of roses stays on your mat faintly not overwhelming very easy to use spray on cloth wipe it down let it dry  all natural which i love and will not harm your mat  a great product for your cherished yoga mat  i would highly recommend this product
wow i like the colors and quality is good
no complaints about the formulation of this probiotic it hits the mark for both potency 25 billion cfus and strain diversity total of 10 strains 8 lactobacillus and 2 bifidobacterium stains the specific strains are listed on the bottle but not the specific concentration of eachit delivers the 25 billion cfus with a serving size of only 1 capsule 2 caps are the more common situation making this bottle of 30 caps a months supplythe downside is the price there are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same or sometimes better potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a months supplywhile the formulation is solid the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars average equally good options are available that are a much better value
this was useful when i had it gave me an effective way of straigtening my hair without burning my skin off lol heheh anyway now i just dont have as much of a problem with my hair being curly so i dont need this as much but i keep it in case i need to straighten my hair for an event or occasion bcs i dont want to go back to normal straighteners so glad this exists
they are comfortable and fit well and good price

the herbal infusions strength killed any odor on the pad also the remedy gave a cooling sensation i would love to exclusively use this brand
makes granite looks good and very smooth after cleaning
great product
i got these for my wife who said they cut like butter no jagged edges they cut smoothly and you barely have to press down on the lever youll never buy the cheapo cvs walmart ones againspending this much on nail clippers you would be crazy not to i dont think we got fake ones this is a high quality machine im already ordering the bigger one
not bad but i think being that my foot is small it rides up so i find myself pulling it down but when i do that it doesnt cover my fore toe but i will continue to use it because i need to see if it works better its only been 1 day so i will update later
i have trouble sleeping and magnesium seems to help this package of individually packaged doses makes it easy to consume magnesium in a liquid versus tablet or capsule form it has the potential to be more potent as it gets into your bloodstream more quickly i also like the taste a bit sweetwhile i appreciate the convenience of having each dose premeasured for me the doses come in these small plastic vials to get out the entire liquid i found myself biting down on the plastic vial itself as if it were candy and indeed these vials remind me of the candy soda pop vials that kids swilled by biting off the wax top and then drinking the sugary liquid inside its kind of wasteful but i cant deny theyre convenientgreat for travel but not great for the environment
i have about 4 different kinds of medicine and this is perfect before i bought this i would dig through my purse looking for different bottles but now i just look for my little grey box and everything is right there it has never come open on its own which is also a plus
great workout capris  there are a little thicker than expected and the material dries a little slower than other pairs i have in different brands but great for running  easy to move in these capris breathable material  there is a lot of stretch to these  if anyone is trying to figure out there proper size i am 51034 162 lbs waist 3234 hip 3934
you would think every pain relief cream is the same  i guess that is what i thought but i was wrong  in the beginning i would use bengay  you can get it at every store and it works  i like the smell of pain relief creams  the mentholy smell actually is relaxing in itself for me  bengay works for us  but then at the chiropractor i started using biofreeze  i guess i should back up a littlemy husband has scoliosis so his back always hurts  personally i have a neck injury including a spur a mid back injury from a car wreck so i have a lot of scar tissue under my shoulder blades  i have also just been diagnosed with arthritis in my foot  i probably have it in my knees and elsewhere going to a rhuemy in a few weeks  anywayi guess what i am trying to say we have pain  we are both pretty active dont like to take a lot of meds but like most do not like pain  who doesso biofreeze i like biofreeze you can get it in a big pump bottle  it is more of a gel and spreads okay it just seems like i have to use a lot  icyhot i had to buy that we were running out of biofreeze and the store didnt have bengay  icyhot is okay  it is hard to spread and it seems like you have to use a lot of productnow reliefor  i honestly like it  i had a chance to try it for a discount in exchange for an honest review  i am glad i did  i like the consistency  it is not a lotion not a gel  it is a light blue liquid cream and spreads so nicely  i used it on my husbands back and it it spreads around so easy  he said it didnt feel as hot34 as others he has tried but i had also just given him an alcoholic beverage and he was feeling pretty relaxed   mei tried it on my neck and shoulder knee and foot  i like it  it brought relief  it brought warmth  it was easy to put on and absorbed well and is non greasyi would like to look and see if they carry bigger sizes  i would buy this again  it is probably my favorite out of all the creams i have tried  really  so i recommend trying it and seeing for yourself
loved the product just dont think i will order that particular size again too big  the adhesion is fantasticmuch better than what came with the unit
husband likes these because the bristles are pretty stiff he likes a nice firm back scrubber  they seem to hold up  i will update should new info seem useful
feels nice and blocks the light fits a little close to the eyeballs  but i am using nightly and i like it
i bought this to try on nerve pain particularly sciatic nerve pain it has a nice creamy moisturizing feel and is easily blendedabsorbed by the skin not a bad product but in this application for this person it is not working to soothe the pain weve used it over several weeks and it isnt dulling the nerve pain as well as a soaking bath with magnesium salts does in this case tried it for muscular pain and it seems to do ok for the price for our needs i would buy magnesium salts and soak in the tub instead great shippingfulfillment of the order seller is great
thick and comfortable when they come out of the package  i use mine in a medical boot because it is so hot and the inserts are flat with no cushion and i doubled up after 2 days
just like going to the hygienist
im very happy with this spray cleaner  it smells great and not sticky  i would try other 34flavors34 when i run out of peppermint
excellent product give me a great workout have no regrets
for the price its good  one thing though  depending where i moved it on the kitchen floor or bathroom floor it was off consistently by 2 pounds up or down  which means its the floor not the scale  for example it would say 128 or 130 but nothing in between and not all over the place when i was weighed at the doctor office it was consistent
im never disappointed by this brand which makes great gua sha stones this pink rose quartz is well packaged and the stone is smooth and polished its great for using against your skin and a number of youtube videos show you how to do it its a nofrills package but the quality of the stone makes up for it
never seen a product dispense medicine like this turn knob and medicine comes out besides that it works  i use it for back pain and on the soles of my feet for neuropathy
these did help somewhat for dry eye but not enough for the price
along with the fact that these are wonderful at keeping the bloating away they capsule size is also medium so they are easy to swallow  some capsules are so huge i cannot take them but these are average size  great product
my bottle arrived without a lid pretty unhappy about that because now i cant carry it with me in my bag due to it possible getting the spray nozzle knocked off or broke or causing it to leak the product works but i dont understand how it could be shipped just thrown into a bubble mailer with no lid and nothing to keep it from leaking
doesnt smell like lemon essential oil at all to me smells very fake i think i should have been wary to buy such a large bottle for such an inexpensive price
i love the product and wish i could buy more
i didnt know how much dead skin i had until i used it so much dead skin came out and easily after a few minutes it was like i have new feeti didnt try the nail part completely yet but i did polish the nails and they came out great this is a great buy

vegetable glycerin used in food applications is usp grade or over 99 pure and has a sweet taste vegetable glycerin metabolizes differently than sugar and is used in low carbohydrate foods for sweetness and moisture unlike sugar glycerin does not contribute to tooth decaymany household products including lotions shampoo and toothpaste contain vegetable glycerin glycerin is added to these products because it is a humectant a substance that attracts moisture to the skin in the cosmetic world this has two practical applications first glycerin leaves your skin hydrated glycerin soap for example is popular for that very reason second for cosmetic products that deliver an active ingredient a humectant can increase the solubility of the active ingredient making it more easily absorbed by the skini personally use this glycerin to make my own soap i love iti also love the price i will be buying again and again
i heard of sea moss awhile ago and been searching for them in supermarket but no luck at all therefore i turned to amazon and surprisingly this particular brand has many 5 star reviews so i went ahead and bought thisit look genuine and promising from the packaging upon opening the bag i found bits and pieces of things that were confusing at first that was only a tiny bit of the sea moss i took out from the bagi did a little research and read all of the question and answers on the amazon page regarding this product the seller mentioned that this sea moss originate from indonesia previous edited from philippinesthe colorful threads and strings are plastic it is not surprising at all if these sea moss were farmed near textile factories these very thin plastic threads are made from melting of plastic and making them into fine threads and then into clothing the finer transparent plastic threads clings to the sea moss for their life it is almost impossible to get rid of every single piece you will see what i mean if you soak italso on the packaging itself located on the back states  34cal prop 65 warning34 this product contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harmthis indication is not pointing to sea moss causing cancer but the substance that is in the sea moss that comes from waste and heavily polluted areas i have am pointing out what is clearly stated i love sea moss but this particular brand contains dangerous chemicals that causes cancer it horrifies me even further because indonesia is no where near safe from the fukushima spill all of the area of the pacific ocean contain high level of radiation due to the spill sea plants are highly sensitive and will absorb these radiation thats why sea food from the pacific ocean are much cheaper compare to the atlanticas always do your research and watch out better safe than sorry
i love the fresh air smell
wonderful blocking mats thicker than usual and very sturdy  should last me many years  im very satisfied  they got here super fast too
i bought several of these to have our crew test them out and they are indeed the genuine article for a few dollars less than our regular supplier plus they come in a nice case once opened and unfurled i couldnt tell them apart from our first batch of authentic bandages  they are well manufactured and work exactly as they should in our numerous drills  when we need more for our trauma  first aid kits well be sure to stock these
i was surprised how well this cleaned  removed grease  from places i had trouble with before would love if it was a little larger still works wonders if you add a bit of cleaner or viviparous to sponge  if you have reactions to cleanser because of odor or chemicals this is a must have
i use this for keeping dust out of my nose when i change the catbox ive no idea how effective it is on a scientific level but it decreases the irritation a lot i preferred this to disposable masks since i have enough trash as it is
whats better than a piña colada a piña colada the packs a powerful protein punch i definitely give this drink mix five stars for flavor it doesnt taste at all like traditional whey protein powder it seriously does just taste like youre drinking a piña colada blend  it with some ice and coconut milk and you are good to go before ordering it i scoured the product information page but i couldnt find a list of ingredients listing the sweetener i am fairly particular about what sweeteners i use but decided to take a chance since i love piña colada even though i didnt see where the sweetener was listed i was disappointed when it arrived and saw that uses sucralose which tends to make me feel sick i will probably not be finishing this due to that fact despite the delicious flavor the ingredients list on the amazon page literally just says whey protein isolate this should definitely be updated so that people can make an informed decision about what theyre putting into their bodies if you dont mind sucralose this is a delicious protein powder for sure
great for travel
fits ok it feels a little big for me but to use it in the house i have no issues the shoes come with a shoelace that can be adjusted with a cord lock and that help with the size issue the battery its very easy to place the battery inside the shoe pocket and secured it with the zipper its comfortable yes a bit but still have the feeling the shoe is a little bit big for me how about the heat the heat did not felt that strong just enough to warm your feet i guess thats a good thing to avoid sweat in this type of shoe the material looks ok but is not waterproof at all thats what i mention about interior shoes the shoe feel soft in the inside and kinda wabbly in the back of the shoes in general i like this shoes to chill in the house but i wish the heat was a bit stronger
this is the best of the critter chasers i have tried here easier to install and seem to be louder extra star come with documentation for maintenance and battery replacement waiting to see how long the rechargeable batteries last this is my second purchase of this set
these must have come from a bad batch i bought these to replacer previously purchased refills that werent working the spray is coming out of the bottom of the head of the spray can and filling up the holder not spraying out into the air this is a manufacturing issue and poor quality control
feels very supporting on my foot
love these socksthey really work good  i ware them doing the day around the house
have tried several arch support brands  this one seems to be the only one that actually provides 4cm stablizing reinforcement to my high arches  have reoccuring plantar faciatis  these help stabilize my arches to help reduce pain  formed plastic eva doesnt deform when standingwalking to provide consistent support
product as stated
when my baby is congested i rub this on her feet and the next morning she is all better
doesnt clean try ounces ounces then the rest of bottle
very cumbersome to use didnt see any difference in curl a manual crimping curler works far better not sure why i was asked drying power and flavor
i have a quip toothbrush that i have used for travel for the last couple of years  i dont think it cleans that well it only has one speed but you can replace the battery easily  this sonic toothbrush will replace it completely  the hieie has 5 different modes and 3 speeds claims to run 30 days on one charge has a nice carrying case and really cleans my teeth  i can tell a big difference when i use it from my oralb toothbrush gums feel like they have been worked over and the teeth feel cleaner  cant wait for my next dentist appointment to see if it really helps as much as it feels like it doesone star off easy of use for no instructions in the package and that the charging base doesnt fit in the travel case  note that the charging base is tiny very easy to place  doesnt come with usb charging block does come with the usb cable  since everyone has too many usb charging blocks i dont see that as a negative
bulky and too thick
capella flavor drops gingerbread concentratefor  a flavoring it taste soso  has a slightly artificial under taste  nice smell i added to my coffee and food it sort of tastes like it has ginger in it but only semiconvincing weak flavor  not terrible but not good  bitter is not the problem  ginger tends to be a little bitter but the flavor is not balanced properly  will finish bottle because it not its awful but will not buy again
its ok i use it for my injuries in the shower i need something a little more rough this is nice to keep your skin soft with daily use i rinse off with cold water to prevent a rash but using anything with friction on the skin can cause irritation
i guess the only product i have in my history of teeth whitening is crest strips these do not truly compare to them these did not cling as well to my teeth as the crestdo i had to keep readjusting to assure they would stay in place as far as actual whitening i did see a slight improvement in the whiteness of my teeth the big plus here is that these are about 12 the price of crest so if you are looking to save some money these might be great for you
i love the premise of this vitamins to help you feel good during practice and contribute to keeping you fit and limber this line has such a wonderful array of products and this is no exception ive only been taking them for a few days but so far i like them a lot and recommend giving them a try
this is an okay straightener and curler i personally did not find it better than the one i have been using i think my granddaughter took it home with her and she has been using it just fine she has a thick head of hair but the strands are fine like mine so it is easy to work with our hair
actually daughter loves it
there are red lights around the entire inside of the collar and an infrared heat coil over the spine in the back segment of the collar its easy to open and slide around your neck which i tend to do from the front or side then rotate the collar into place and then shortpress the power button on the front outside of the collar to start it you can longpress to stop it at any time or shortpress to cycle through 3 heats levels the red lights appear to have only one intensity yes i wouldnt want them to dim even the lowest heat 1 is pretty toasty and im a gal who normally runs infrared as hot as it goes after about a minute its too hot to press directly against my neck but the collar design allows me to shift it slightly back and itll stay that way overall im pleased most red light devices dont allow good coverage of the neck but this one does
this is one time i should have paid attention to other buyers reviews  this is very unstable and words dont begin to describe how hard it was to put together  sadly since this was made in china the cost was too high because we all know that the product cost very little for the company to have made and the markup to the consumer is a sin
product description was wrong it said it was compatible with my brush but they werent
i loved how this made my skin feel after using no unexpected reactions from my sensitive skin
these were a literal life savor for my wedding when i was breaking them in beforehand my heels kept popping up if i wasnt careful but the day of i stuck these in and they where comfortable and kept my feet from popping out the entire night this also involved me hiking all over gardens and climbing hills and rocky paths i never once was concerned about losing a shoe and falling to my death if you need that little something to keep your heels in place get these they are perfect
i bought these for my husband he wears a mask as work and it was hurting his ears these did the trick he said its just what he needed
i like the mixture of ingredients incorporated into this product the dose for one capsule seems rather low so i have been taking two i tend to have a sensitive stomach when it comes to taking pills this formulation does not bother my stomach at all seems to be very gentle which helps in compliance in taking these every day i normally take a shot of acv in a glass of water and this is actually so much better the other ingredients are great additions to help boost the affect of acv i seem to be in more control of my appetite lately and i think that regular use of these pills have contributed to that even so taking acv every day is beneficial to health
just what i was looking for  the curling iron has several settings to control heat and time  it is easy to use and the curls last
checked out on the tester as fully charged
our chiropractor sells these pillows at her office and had encouraged me to try one after i was treated for neck pain resulting from a whiplash injury  this was over 10 years ago and its the only pillow i will use  i usually buy a 3 pack and replace my pillows in less than 2 years so this is an economical way to buy them  when i purchased my first 3 pack i had my husband try one and he liked it as well
one end is same as a people brush the other end is smaller but not thinner i use the small end  switched to my finger
these are delicious and so flavorful  i was expecting a vinegary hot sauce taste these are not like that at all they are great for dipping or adding flavor to anything
exactly what i asked for in a timely manner
these hair trimmers cut my hair very efficiently they gave my hair a smooth and even trim the motor proved very powerful and did not slow down at all with a great battery life and very sharp blades they surprisingly did not irritate my skin these professional trimmers are much better than most any that i have ever used they are a precision instrument and were well engineered great design and even better followthrough
good product but on silver jewelry use with caution  i suggest testing a small area first  dont leave silver jewelry immersed longer than a couple of seconds  love it for sterling silver chains  quickly dip in and out  i always rinse jewelry in water after dipping
i had to have a handyman help me put this in the trap underneath the kitchen sink i did notice that the sink drained faster and with less issues after having used the tablet  it was less convenient than using a powder version but it did work
its a little stiff
one of the best protein flavors i had the other ones are better but this one is still pretty good
this is a really nice unit for back pain  i was in a car accident a few years ago  ive bought tons of back braces over the years massage tools and other items to help back pain  id definitely put this in the top three of the items that have provided pain reliefits very easy to use  set the base up put the device on top of it  then just turn it on  i let it go on automatic mode and was happy with that  my wife like the heat too  said it felt really goodwe are very happy with this overall
this case is super attractive and holds a total 27 of my vitamin e 2000 iu capsules if i could remove the insert it would hold a few moreloves love the the design and that there is a different embossing on the top and bottom so i can tell which end is up love that it is small enough to be portable the clasp is super sturdy so it will not come undone in my pursedislikes i wish the insert were removablein summary this case is really sturdy and super attractive it will only hold a few horsesized pills but it is great for those who have smaller pills to carry also the clasp is very sturdy  the current price of 999 is competitive for this
i have been suffering a couple months with heel pain from plantar fasciitis  i thought id give these a try and wow i was surprised at how much they cut down on the pain  i wish they came in a tighter and thicker version
i like these well packaged as well
not as good as some of the others
it says no fish burps but ive been burping fish starting 30 minutes after i took it  i wont buy these again because their claims are just not true
this was a gift for my boyfriend and i was pleasantly surprised by the quality its super convenient for both home use and travel he mainly keeps it on his desk since thats usually where he is when its time to take his medication then when we go away he just throws it in a backpack or toiletry bag it takes up less space and looks nicer than those orange pharmacy bottles and he never has to wonder if the lid is on correctly either a small button on the front pops the lid right open and pressing it back into place automatically closes it securelythe interior is divided into two compartments they might be a bit small for extended trips but a single side can hold enough of his prescription to last several weeks so he generally uses the second side for something else when we travel the amount of pills this box holds obviously depends on their size but all of the medications we have at home fit well including large otc capsules and vitaminsoverall this pillbox seems wellmade and durable it has a nice weight to it and its easy to clean the image on top looks exactly as pictured except for a couple scuffs on the bottom its still in great condition and perfect working order after several months of consistent use my boyfriend isnt exactly careful with it so id say its held up splendidly i think it was well worth the price
scratched the heck out of me
first container contained black small particlesa like it was previously opened
these bars are amazing  low sugar  high protein  probiotics make you so full  sometimes i cant get through whole bar kids love this flavor too like this one better than almond one hard to find in stores  wish they sold them more places please carry through whole foods
good product  shipped quickly  thank you
this is just a flat iron with teeth  if you roll it on your hair it pulls and burns the hair that gets stuck  i do not recommend  its a waste of money  i am asking for my money back
moved a lot and did not feel helpful
using hemp products is a bit of a crap shoot because youre never quite sure if the product is going to have any effect on your condition  so im giving a cautious thumbs up for this because ive been using it with great success on an inflamed muscle in my leg  i didnt expect it to work this well i tried it because when i test a product i put it through all sorts of paceswhat i found was that within about 5 minutes of application the pain in my leg and backside had eased considerably  it didnt go away entirely that required the addition of some nsaids but it did make the discomfort manageable which is a blessing  when i tried this as a sleep aid it did nothing for me  results on a headache were mixed  i will say that some advice i was given  always look for hemp products that are co2 extracted  was good advice because i find such products to be acrosstheboards more effective than any otherswhat can i take away from these experiments mostly what i take from most such experiments we are all different and products like this which are created without set standards will inevitably vary so if this works for you for some conditions be glad use it you lucked out  if it doesnt hand it off to someone else who might have better luck and try something else
i love this product and its great for so many ailments its definitely an acquired taste and its not particularly cheap but i think every household should have it in their medicine cabinet
these bags are very strong and easy to see through im using them to move and store belongings they are easy to get off the roll i bought another box to have on hand
not sure yet because i just put them on
i have ms and am recovering from a multiply broken back  i think i can honestly doubt i would have survived even this well without these to get me through the day when i have to be in a car at home in bed after therapy and sitting for a few minutes in the sun for vitamin d
came on time very useful in keeping counter top clean nice to have everything that goes in the dishwasher
i believe turmeric is so good for your overall health these capsules include gingers which are also great
read many reviews all glowing and not one with my problem  while putting it on the top gasket the one with the hole consistently popped out of the blue ring  rats i was so looking forward to a first shower in nearly a week  im sure my wife was too  solution  easy i made sure boot gasket was properly seated on the lower ring an put a band of surgical cloth tape over the boot gasket  the carefully placed the top gasket centering it and press the top ring down all around now the gasket will not slip out and youre ready for your shower
great stuff works awesome on all baby kid and adult stains formula spit up baby food and leaky diapers works better than any other stain remover ive tried
very strong energy from this amazing
leave this product in your shower while the water is still running pour the oil onto your body and rub it in also pour some oil under your running bath water this is my absolute go to oil
really tasty and high quality product  highly recommend
i have been taking these daily for a month now and am pleased with the results good quality vitamin d3 at a fair price
needs reheating  kind of too chewy but delish to keep in emergency
arrived with one candle broken so returned the whole thing do not know about the longevity  it doesnt smell that great unlit but not sure if it would smell better once you light it
i used it for cleaning and it smells great and last long and cleans good
these are great and well made the material is sisal so its a little scratchy but considering youre using it to get clean its a plus similar to a loofa the bags hold up in the washer too i throw them in with my towels
works bit the lock for mouth piece jet doesnt snap well
totally happy with it met my needs and expectations
poor cleaner does not make me feel like the mat is clean after wiping down smells nice though
these are very nicely padded if you are like me and have a skinny arm then they are loose and do slip down but i prefer this to the really tight fit that cuts off circulation i have washed once to check durability air dry only and they are in great condition i am happy enough and would buy again
for the most part the unit functions well  however the instructions are written in what appear to be 00000000000000001 font size  in addition the writer obviously spoke very poor english and the instructions were not meant for this unit  not sure what moron thought this was a good idea but they have no business writing an instruction manual
i was quite surprised when i made my first smoothie using the smoothie blender bombs absolutely delicious very filling  for half the day definitely would buy again i purchased the peanut butter chocolate yummy
needed this for my 32 oz bottle of hibiclens
i have used kt tape and rock tape both are excellent but expensive i tried this brand but not again  i must be allergic to the adhesive it has torn my ankle up very itchy and irritated swollen and welts not happy
did not work at all a waste of money really i left it in a heel that annoyed me in one area to try and stretch it out and i had it there for days it did nothing
just what we needed
this goat milk bath was so luxurious i purchase the 2 piece sampler and used the lavendar  rose it doesnt have overwhelming aroma if youre concerned about clashing with your perfume my skin gets dried out in the winter and this soak made my skin so soft and moisturized afterwards that i didnt even have to apply lotion the product dissolves completely and the bath water turns milky which i think gives you the total spa experience love the five sisters products and look forward to trying any new items they might bring out
price is a little high
i appreciate that this noni fruit powder is certified organic and nongmo it appears that the only ingredient is the noni fruit the powder does not have a strong taste but i usually use it in a green drink or fruit smoothie it stirs in fine they include a small plastic 2 g serving scoop about a teaspoon in this 8 ounce sized package there are about 114 scoops so the powder will last for a while seems to be a good quality product
i suffered severe chronic constipation for 8 years going from dr to dr was diagnosed with lazy bowel disease and tried everything imaginable to find relief but found no cure after having read about it from this linkand tried it i have not been constipated since it took about a week of gradually increasing the dosage to take full effect but to me using this supplement has been like a medical miracle and i am very grateful lt3
i have sprayed my patio every day and the stray cat still comes and lays on it waiting for birds at my bird feeder  waste of money
i think this container of collagen is kind of pricey coming in at 3998 as of this review  ive reviewed other high quality collagens that cost less and were also flavorless  that said i think this is a good collagen product for collagens i and iii  it dissolves well in liquids and has no taste that i can detect  ive been taking collagen on a daily basis for about 8 months and have finally started to notice improvement in the skin on my arms and face  it takes a long time to see results so consistency is needed  my skin is a lot more flexible and plumper
feels flimsy and im afraid every time i step down on it
this is my favorite goto wild rice mixone time i couldnt find this brand in stock so i got the rice select rice blend instead  big mistake and big disappointment as the first ingredient in the rice select blend was texmati white rice
i do not know if has helped my joints or anything else people claim but it maintains my cholesterol better than the fish pills
these are really soft and easy to insert  much better than others ive used  at this price just buy em
im a really big fan of rez block essentially what happens is that when rez block is added to water the water is then able to trap a lot of the resin that would normally accumulate in the piece of glassware or end up in our lungsyou will want to change your water more frequently with rez block as it fairly quickly shows just how much gunk it is stopping
the girl loves bath bombs and is usually the only one who gets them this set i had her mom take with her and they get to share them they love them it is so nice to give a gift that someone absolutely loves
this is exactly what i need i need the extra protection against harsh chemicals in my work environment it goes on soft and does not feel heavy or greasy this size jar will last me quite a long time
loved these i searched everywhere for birthday decorations that were fun and modern and i bought several things from ling s everything arrived in great condition and quality i would definitely use this manufacturer again
im a protein powder nut i start off every day with a protein shake and i love trying new flavors and combinations of flavors to keep it from getting boring of all the proteins ive tried recently this and the oatmeal cookie version from the same brand have been some of my favorites flavor wise oh my word yum i thought it would be like nutela but it actually has a bit of a nutty flavor along with the chocolate which i really enjoyed i seriously love the taste it mixes smoothly and isnt gritty at all my only complaint is that its sweetened with sucralose id prefer something a little more natural like stevia or monk fruit but other than that its fantastic
bounty is about as good for a fraction of the price
this device is awesome it has allowed me to have mobility after footankle surgery it can also be easily moved out of the way for another driver to use the car normallyby the way i did not purchase it here i rented it directly from the seller which is a great option for those that only need it short term
this has a great flavor works well
too hot and being tied to the usb insane
works well for massaging lotion or whatever cream you want to use i find the roller isnt as easy or feel as comfortable while using it
this thermometer does not work took temperature today and it read 346 dont think that is right at sll
i have this coffee recommended by anthony williams and i want to share this with my mom and she she loves it and i have reordered this chicory coffee 3 times already and she cant get enough
these are wellmade mop heads the microfiber center had zero loose or puckered threads and the density of the microfiber was nicely dense for good pickup performance the fringe around the edge is stitched on well and also did not have any loose or pulled threads they fit and work well with many platform mops provided that the mop has velcro on the underside of the platform to grip the padthese work very well when dry mopping the microfiber picks up and holds an impressive amount of dust pet hair and other similar gunk the fringe around the edge makes it easy to clean right up to the baseboard or if used in the kitchen at the cabinet toe kick area it also helps ensure that the mop doesnt mar any chair legs or furniture if it gets bumped while moppingthe performance is not as good as a wet mop due to the fringe thats not a problem specific to these pads but occurs with any pad that has an outer fringe its certainly useable and effective as a wet mop but a nonfringe mop head usually performs betterthe set comes incased in a sealed plastic pouch which keeps them nice and clean during transit and can also be used to keep them clean in storagea very good mop head  five stars
fits my water furnace series 7 perfectly the merv 11 is great for the area i live in
this is a fantastic ice roller it is just heavy enough to have a terrific feel in your hand the weigh allows it to roll freely smoothly across whatever body part you are working it on it stays cold long enough to do its magic and its just plain wonderful that it came with a case storing it in the freezer is a breeze compared to other rollers that i have the case makes all the difference in the world the curve of the handle and the weight of the roller actually even made it a great roller for a back massage i highly recommend this little device
excellent product  i feel the benefits

coconut oil is often a solid at room temperature except during the hot months so i was glad to see this oil available for review  our house is kind of cold and it has remained a nice clear and easy to use liquid  its easy to pump out and apply  i cant say its the best moisturizer ive ever used because coconut oil is naturally a little dehydrating  i still like it though and have been using this oil everyday after showering  it does not smell like coconuts at all and has no scent that i can detect
this thing destroyed a pair of pants it also pulled places and added more pilling on a sweater
my husband is a diabetic and he has a lot of nerve pain in his feet because of this i purchased this for him to try because it is 100 pure natural and herbal he has been taking 2 capsules a day for a while now and he is starting to notice less burning and tingling in his feet  this is allowing him to finally get a full nights sleep before he was up walking the floor in pain for hours  hopefully with continued use his feet pain will go away all together i  received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review
my 11 year old daughter got this bath bomb in her christmas stocking and she loved it she has used other bath bombs in the past and they were a bit of a let down so we werent expecting much we were pleasantly surprised it dissolved great not too quickly with lots of fizz and the color was a vibrant teal blue just like in the pic but the best part of this bath bomb is the fragrance its called flower bomb and its described as smelling like primrose i was dreading the smell because the scent of artificial floral beauty products is usually pretty awful in my opinion this bomb smelled so pretty not too strong or overly sweet im super picky about smells and i loved it id definitely buy this particular bomb again and its likely that id try others made by da bomb oh and it came with the little flower eraser shown in the pic so cute
i loved this lip balm when i first started using it  after daily use for two months im having a terrible reaction  the lip balm causes irritation dry throbbing and cracking lips  there is also truth to the mold issue for this product  do your research  i have an unopened 5 pack that i plan to return asap  do yourself a favor and dont use im not sure how long it will take the negative affects to go away but ive thrown all of my used items away
they hold up well
i purchased this for my dad who has cancer and has issues standing in the shower this seat fits his tub perfectly and has different levels the seat can sit so it can go higher or lower depending on preference it has a soap holder too which is nice and a mesh bag its a must have for elderly or disabled people it makes showering much easier because you can sit instead of standing
these glasses are great overall with one painful exception the nose pads  the pads themselves are the thinnest ive ever seen on glasses and provide very little cushioning  to add to this flaw the pad arms arent able to support even the weight of the glasses and are always bending  when the arms and pads are properly positioned which is rare these glasses feel uncomfortable on your nose  they are always bending though and literally become little daggers cutting into the bridge of your nose
love this product  i noticed a huge difference in my skin after using it for a while
my feet thank you homedics
whether you believe in the power of chakras or not this black tourmaline pyramid is an attractive piece to display on your table it has the weight and heft of a paperweight so i dont see any reason why it cant be used as such it has a lot of sparkly stones on the inside with a crystal wrapped several times over with copper wire the bottom has a copper wire as well in a circle i dont know that much about chakras but just looking at this beautiful item makes me feel calmer
what a back saver
ordered this to help with removing old boat decals from 2010 what a waste of  figured at the price it should be fantastic lesson learned just because it cost five or six times more does not mean it works half as good as others also no refunds they do not stand by their product use acetone or goo be gone and save your money sure wish i did
i love these found them while traveling through ireland and now cannot use anything else
junk arrived doa
made very well helped with my pain
yes i really like this product
they work great theyre ear plugs i got tired of using balled up kleenex the only issue is the vibration noise of the cord traveling into the ear canal when it moves around while trying to study  i have used a pair of foam plugs from work that have a plastic cord and its quieteri like these tho i take the cord off to study for school doesnt matter as much if im doing yardwork or in a high noise environment
use this a few times a week on a bichon and it keeps her eyes bright and clean
nobody to blame but myself you get what you pay for  i used this thing for just a few minutes before it had to come off and hasnt been used since  save your money  get something that is fully functional

i think it takes a while to seefeel the effects my knees may be feeling a bit better rating may change as i use it longer
these are easy to swallow and supplement our probiotics has helped maintain a healthier feel for both of us these have helped maintain regularity as well as our overall energy levels the ingredients seem to be in line with todays more natural and organic solutions as with all things everyone should be mindful of your own unique digestive tolerances
i have not used it yet but it new and i should have no problems with it  it was a good buy  it really smells godd and it does work for the purpose it ws bought for
i love these reading glasses they are really comfortable and crystal clear i wasnt sure if id like the metal side or not but they havent been a problem at all
i have severe lower back issues this provides great support both in my car seat and my chair
i purchased this in july it is now october so i think that i have used it off and on long enough to give a reviewi say off and on because i am not the most dedicated person in the world when it comes to dieting and taking vitamins and supplements with that said i am very pleased with this product it does what it says blocks the fat and carbs that you eat with your meals  i warn you that you will see the results of that in your bathroom breaks in 812 hours you do become more 34regular34 thats how i know it is working i noticed that i do find myself adjusting my fat and carb intake depending on how often i have to go to the bathroom so in that respect the product is encouraging me to alter my eating habits the bottle is 60 capsules so if you take it diligently it should only last you about a month but as i said im not diligent so this bottle lasted me until now i took maybe two capsules a day maybe twice a week when i remember to  even then i saw the results  i have not lost much weight yet but i havent gained any either and it is encouraging to know that i can continue to use this as a constant reminder to cut back on the chips and ice cream notice i didnt say cut out chips and ice cream heehee
great for use on days you feel to loosen up after splurging on calories
larry uses this every night before bed it says it keeps his feet from burning so he can sleep thanks
im a busy mom of two small children which means im on my feet a lot pretty much all day when i actually get a few minutes to myself ive been really enjoying this foot massager it has variable speeds and pressure as well as heat that really help my feet feel relaxed i feel like its a little rough on my heels and i wish i could turn that part off once it gets uncomfortable but the disc that massages the arches and the balls of the feet feels good the part that goes over your feet inflates to squeeze your feet kind of like a blood pressure cuff and pushes your feet down onto the massager so you get a deep massage on the bottoms of your feet it comes in a nice box and would be a great gift
this is so easy to use and only takes a few minutes per batch very good quality colloidal silver produced i highly recommend this silver generator
great back support for upper and lower good quality durable comfortable
well i can honestly say these band aids dont work but they are good if you want to prevent itching the bite other than that they dont do anything they do stay stuck for a couple of days even after a couple showers i dont know if i will buy again
as of this review i dont know how much these clean wipes costs  i think they do a good job of cleaning and are about the same size as a full sized kleenex but much stronger and can be used multiple times  i think the idea is that they dont shed any fibers which is great for places where tiny fibers can interfere with sensitive equipment  electronics labs and the situations given on the product page
bought as a gift for my brother who rolls his own bagged tobacco he was only able to use it for 3 months before it broke
have heard iffy reviews about ordering oils on line absolutely not true in this case product arrived well protected and oil is amazing
love these bags theyre absolutely beautiful im obsessed with anything holo and had to grab them and im glad i did theyre well made resealable bags that are very thick could be great for storing candy snacks various herbs little parts the sky is the limit you can use a heat thing and seal the top up easily too these things are just amazing
does exactly what its supposed to do
easy to use and it really does squeeze all the dirty liquid from the pad so youre not mopping with a completely dirty pad
i purchased this repellent for my infant because it didnt have deet eww deet is smelly i absolutely hate seeing mosquito bites on her including her face i needed to get something gentle on her skin and face and as non smelly as possible this stuff actually seems to be working and has not caused any irritation when lightly used on her face we recently went for a walk in a different neighborhood from our own to escape the buggies and as soon as we got out of the car we were bombarded with mosquitoes i quickly applied the repellent on the baby first and you could see the mosquitoes flying around her and the stroller never landing on her skinsmells good and repels id say it works
i got the fitbit aria scale to pair with my fitbit charge and also link with myfitnesspal and in general just make my health journey a bit more streamline and i must admit it really does add value to that compared to my non wifi digital scale that i used for yearsthe design is sleek and sexy i got it in white and is not an eyesore in my bathroom the scale is very responsive and seems to be quite accurate on weight and body fat i love that it autosyncs to my fitbit and myfitnesspal apps so i dont need to worry about remember to manually enter it i also like the feature that it can recognize up to 8 people my bf uses it occasionally and it knows when it is me or him that steps in the scale overall it is certainly overpriced for what it is but if you can get over that i think its a fantastic and sleek fitness tool to have if i didnt usehave a fitbit charge i probably would not be able to justify purchasing this scale but if you do i think you will notice that it does add value to your fitness regimen
i think they are smaller than average deodorant tubes and the lids are a little loose but they work well
the colors are soft the paper absorbent and the overall feel is quality  really like this product and i believe you will too
recently someone sprayed our small office with a couple of squirts of the glade icy evergreen forest  it felt like christmas i was happy to find this spray available at amazon i also purchased the plugin scent warmers
anti fog effectiveness is marginal and my glasses are now constantly smudged cleaning them multiple times a day hoping to totally get rid of this stuff
my shibas love this toy and it can hold up to my pitbullsharpei mixs chewing  i love a toy that all 3 of my dogs can enjoy  im not sure the bristles are doing much cleaning since they seem to prefer chewing on the hard plastic but any chewing is better than none  highly recommend this toy for chewers of all sizes
and have loved it for years i keep this in the shower and when i am done before toweling dry i spray it all over esp on elbows knees  feet then i towel dry  sometimes ill spray a lil on my body when dry if im going for that soft sexy not too shiney look   awesome product highly recommend
i dont know why the description says theres four  i received a threepack of reading glasses with a prescription of 150 in the colors of blue red and brown all of them are in the wayfarer style with half of the stems being a seethrough plastic which is a cool stylistic touch each pair of glasses comes with a matching foam case which makes it easy to identify which is which the lenses are on the thin side but so far they seem durable i like the fact that there are three so that if i lose one i can use the other two as backups
i wear this ever night i was taking 5 or more sleeping pills with no luck by leaving this on i feel well rested there are nights i am awake while it is on but you will go in and out of conscienceness without recognizing the night goes by in minutes but this is due to restlessness
love this file hard to get in stores
my kid did not appreciate flavor
my hair needs to get a little longer and i think this tool will work great  my hair doesnt stay in it very well at its current length
he did not measure properly its too small but were using it
this product i take at night to help me relax and get a good night sleep it has also helped with leg cramps i love this product
loved the how well the cleaners worked but only like the lemon smell the lavender or whatever the purple bottle was had a horrible smell
tastes great and peps you up
this just works
these are thick and comfortable and fit well in my shoes these are wellmade
it works but doesnt shave very close  dissappointing
so i originally gave these earplugs a 1 star review i had used them as directed and they didnt stay in at all then some time later i couldnt find the ones i had been using instead another brand so i looked at the quies earplugs again and decided to try to make them worki took one earplug divided it into half kneaded each half to soften them up and pressed them over my ear canalsthey actually work better this way than the other brand as when split in half the wax core is exposed the cotton holds them in my ears better as they wick the moisture from my ears the other brand doesnt ive been using these ever since and will reorder when needed
love these  the colors are bright like i wanted
bought this for my husband not very palatable and ended up throwing away if it doesnt taste good its not going to be used no matter how good it might be for you
i take hot yoga and need a good mat cleaner that doesnt irritate my skin or make a room full of people escape from the smell this is it  moderate and mild aroma cleans well enough for general surface cleaning needs and the towel is washable with a decent washcloth size to it
glasses adhere for a few minutes but the eventually just get greasy and slide off more than usual
love this my son will not take the little citrus fruit flavored probiotics ive tried three different kinds he spits them out as soon as they hit his mouth these are individually packaged so its not a guessing game with how much to give i just sneak a packet into his morning bottle of milk and in ten minutes hes had his full serving of probiotics and prebiotics for the day its pretty cool especially with cold season coming upon us i want to get a head of the game and build his little immune system theyve worked wonders for me would definitely recommend them
legitimate product though cost is high
nice white mask but too big
are you kidding me wonderful product with great application thank you will refer clients to you
this stuff is the greatest
i needed a soupy toothpaste for my newfangled ultrasonic toothbrush this is basically like a mouthwash all liquid i like the dispenser and intend to make a liquidy toothpaste and put into this dispenser so basically i bought an 8 dispenser it was worth a shot but i would say save your money
exactly as expected each letter comes with two small hole punches for extra sturdiness and the string to wind through to create the banner all letters were present and the quality of the glitter card stock was good excellent value for the price shipped in packaging that kept the letters from bending
i guess i mean i didnt get sick on my trip abroad  12h plane rides included
cla is a secret ive used for years to control my weight and help me build and retain muscle this formulation is very potent the serving size is four capsules you can split this into two each with your two largest meals i highly recommend this productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
these restrict airflow so you wake up in the middle of the night with a headache cause you cant breathe
i cant complain about the product or the amount of time it took to get the items  the only thing that was a little concerning was how easily the protective seal came off the top of the bottle when i opened it  it was sealed but i suspect it was the glue used at the time of manufacturing  other than that the item was as described and delivered promptly  the price was also reasonable  i would buy from this seller again
i had 2 and in our house i noticed the moldmildew was gone in the 2 rooms i had them in yet some times the rest of the house had a old stale smell hard to explain so i purchased 2 more  i have 6 rooms total in my house and by adding these two units the house smells fresh  clean all the time  i have not had to replace any of the bulbs yet and ive had 2 for over a year  i am so pleased with this product
i was really looking forward to trying this product because it is vegan and organic but no matter what ingredients i add to it it makes my smoothies taste rancid im not sure if i got a bad product or not but regardless its not for me i have found other protein powders that are plant based that taste great or at least arent noticeable when combined with other ingredients this one even smells odd
if you want a good facial cleansing brush but dont want to spend 200 this is a good alternative the brush is compact and easy to hold it doesnt take up much space on a counter it also packs well for travel its cordless and rechargeable its a good skincare tool dont forget to clean your brush with antibacterial soap after each usethanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
these clippers are a strong sturdy and sharp but theyre a little tight to use i dont have a lot of strength in my hands
made well great value and shipping was speedy
im so glad i found these i know apple cider vinegar is good for you but i love the gummies much better easier for oral consumption  excellent detox
too soon to tell that its whitening but i find that its really great on killing the morning breath and great for use after meals especially lunch time at the office for those of you who do that sorta thing
much smaller than i expected and not very soft at all
yes  i bought this because it is kleenix  i knew it would be soft and especially absorbent  there is no fragrance  just simple softness  and  reason for absorbency  two ply
it works as described i recommend this product
super cute great as party favors for our daughters birthday party
these are not extra wide and they are not diabetic socks they were regular socks and amazon is not looking at these vendors close enough
excellent sturdy product i have only used it a couple of days so far but i definitely prefer the clips over other styles i had before with the loop attachments i will be ordering more in different styles highly recommend this seller
i do not like it this brand it comes on at barely a touch the cord is short and the speed is not what i am use too i will not buy it again or refer it i wish i could of sent it back
easy to attach smaller than i thought but it is still a good size it is very sturdy too
this sound machine comes with a total of 24 sounds it is packaged with an ac adapter the unit itself a cheat sheet circle and a regular instruction pamphletoperation is simple as per my video i just plugged it in and then pressed the light button for my choice of nightlight color i also pressed the sound playing button to start playing the sounds this button serves as the onoff button for the unit the nightlight feature has seven lights that can be cycled through with two variations of white light the timer feature goes from 15 30 60 90 and 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously there are three sound controls  naturelullaby white noise and fan there are 8 available sounds each for the white noise and fan and 16 nature sounds i particularly like the nature soundsthe current price of 2599  is what machines like this go for of course in the days of smart home speakers such as google home no such device is really needed as i can just ask my google home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine nevertheless for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves this does work know that there will never be more than 24 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds only a few of them will ever be playedi rated this unit three stars for several reasons first i prefer a battery operated unit correction to what i said in my video i do not like the idea that i have to be tethered to a power supply to operate this and want to be able to take it with me anywhere second the controls on top are very difficult to see see photo the printing needs to be a bright white so that it is visible to the operator third the unit is not as sleek as some other units i tried previouslyits tall and squat nevertheless this works as designed and it is a good machine but this is not my top pick
my kids love mario and these bandaids are too cute decent quality too must have for mario fans my kids are 7 and 2 and love them too expensive though
this matters or not dont waste your time but i wont have to match them make it look like theyre tall the matches but then not
these patches really do relieve the pain they can be cut to whatever size you needthey stick extremely well
i used this on an offwhite bench cushion we have in our home  the directions are clear and easy to follow  so far whenever weve gotten dirt or anything else on the cushion weve been able to just brush it off  there is no smell and its nontoxic
great quality and lovely colors  better than i expected for the price  does a great job on my nails and doesnt cause splitting like emery boards
ive been taking 3 tablespoons of this about every other day for about 2 months  there is no doubt it is the real deal  i do feel better but i personally have had unfavorable results  for one i was one of those people who gained weight very easily from taking it i dont know why  i wasnt underweight  i have also noticed that my cycle which has always been off since i was a teenager and had somewhat regulated after the birth of my daughter is now sporadic again  i went 40 days last cycle and now am at like day 46 and still no periodi will continue taking this and probably purchase again  it isnt  the macas team fault my body is reacting this way but my body is reacting and that means the powder is working  i will finish the bag and hope my body settles down  it might take awhile as i started this powder with a pretty big hormonal imbalance
all ingredients come packaged separately in a nice little clear box i followed directions exactly and the soup was delicious i am hoping it will knock this cold i have been fighting for the last week
i am always hoping to find something to curb my appetite  i did not notice any change while using these
and it makes it cute
a however a bit difficult to program
great keto product taste is good and adds a good balance to your day
these vials are very expensive the saline solution is ok the packaging is terrible  when the vial is opened the hole in the vial doesnt squirt directly down into the lens consistently causing a lot of wasted product  the vials do not stand vertically so they leak or become contaminated  i only bought this brand because scleralfil was backordered
i had previously left a 3 star review since i was able to get a smooth shave the first time i used it ive always had trouble shaving intimate areas because of razor burn and ingrown hairs i was very hesitant in purchasing this product because ive tried countless shavers epilators razors you name it  ive probably tried iti used this product one time and it was pretty cool that you use it wet so i decided to try it out in the bathtub it shaved very well even though it was rather difficult reaching some places now the aloe strips helped tremendously and i was quite pleased with the results however after using this one time the aloe strips were ruined and i couldnt use the shaver again because it caused horrible razor burn and didnt get nearly as close of a shave as before there also isnt an option to purchase more aloe strips without having to buy a whole replacement head i contacted customer service and sent pictures of the aloe strips and explained the situation long story short they offered half my money back so id be stuck with a shaver i cant use and half of a refund  no thank you i ended up returning the item dont waste your money on one good shave
if youve ever ruined an item of clothing or upholstery due to a stain youll definitely want this product the spray protects fabrics from all kinds of stains you may want to apply a few layers for some fabrics i highly recommend this productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
i have 3 verilux lamps including this one so that i can use them at my piano reading chair and at bedside  these are sturdy lamps with a nice clean design and a variety of colors to compliment any decor my favorite is the ivory  i have presbyopia and early cataracts so can benefit greatly from higher contrast in reading and needlework these lamps are beyond meeting my expectations  whereas i used to have a lot of eye fatigue and got sleepy while reading at night this is no longer the case the black print appears darker sharper as if id upgraded my glass prescription i find that i have sufficient spread of light for reading an average newspaper page even the newspaper stock quote pages are now readable whereas this isnt the case otherwise  i also do a lot of watercolor painting and needlepoint it is a treat to be able to work into the evening while being confident that my color mixes are true  here is an amusing side note which supports that the light approximates daylightmy elderly cat who enjoys a daily bath in outdoor sunlight sometimes substitutes the verilux lamp light for his spa when the weather is bad it cant be the heat that he is drawn to as little is given off  i can appreciate some reviewers observations that the quality of the light is perhaps overly white yet the lamp is not intended for ambient lighting but rather for a small task area  the light bulbs are not pricey when you consider that they last for 5 years and are thus an average cost of 4 a year also they use less than 15 of the electricity of a traditional 150 watt reading light  if making a decision to purchase this lamp i would suggest that you base it upon your need or wish to have better clarity in visual work at night it is not intended to add daylight to a room  there are many cheaper verilux lookalikes but i wouldnt recommend these there are serious complaintsthat these fall apart in a year or two or fail to work from the beginning
wife didnt like it unfortunately kind of bulky to carry
not worth to send back just bought by mistake wrong model
cleaning myself
perfect for the dessert bar the right size  they are thick and not cheesy looking
cuticle trimmer is not sharp or  precise
i ended up gifting this however the recipient was overjoyed
great product great seller
i have used at least 10 of these grabbers over the last 8 years that ive been wheelchair bound they are remarkable in design but on this particular one the handle split on the 2nd day of use it is not the norm an i will be asking for a replacement i will update my comments then
did nothing for me made me hungry after taking it
second time ordering and they are fresh  not dried out or stale like others selling the same product
do the job very nicelygreat cushionhave purchased before
good price like them
these can be a little difficult im still trying to get them to stay on and fold right even with cleaning my eye area very well they only stay struck on for about 6 minutes but its only the outer corners that keep lifting up
absolutely horrible these are like cheap thin mylar disposable one use only they cant be reused they were so frustrating to wrap up much worse than real christmas presents you have to assemble them they lose air fast
works great  and i think its good for your gums too
these ear plugs are on the large side i ordered them because the picture looked like they were similar to silicone ear plugs my cat stole from me the design is pretty much the same but the size is not these barely fit into my ears and dont go in far enough to block much sound i still like them better than the foam ones those itch but these are not for meif your ear canals are not on the small side i do recommend this type of plug its cleaner and more comfortable than foam and you can wash it
i heard so many great things about adding mushroom supplements to a daily vitamin routine so i gave it a go this brand has been working well and i can tell im more focused at work
i hate all the artificial colors and flavors in gatorade so this is a great alternative i followed the directions and mixed it with 8 oz of cold water and it was easy to dissolve and tasted like sugar water would probably taste better mixed with a little juice to give it some flavor for a child but overall seems like a great product for all members of the family
easy to assemble and decent construction these boxes will be perfect for holding party favors or small beauty products for a beautiful unboxing experience i used some of these for an event and others for giving out graduation gifts and they all looked great no matter the occasion
these containers are very similar to glad or ziploc products  while they are reusable they definitely feel like the kind of product that ends up being thrown away after a few uses  if you want to decrease your plastic use or help the environment glass bento type boxes are probably the way to go  that said these are very convenient  they have two separate sections for food  they seal well  i did have some issues with the lids warping in the dishwasher  overall for the price a decent productif you found my review helpful please click yes below  thank you
the cat was interested in this toy for maybe 510 minutes then it was batted under the couch never to be seen againthe problem is that it shuts off almost immediately when stationary it would be better to have a 1 minute cutoff at least keeping the cats attention a bit longercat says meh
construction quality materials similar to most of the other lipo bags available  purchase for part of the storage setup of some 3s lipos  more or less just one added layer of protection against a lipo incident  during charging continuous monitoring of the lipo internal temp external temp charging rateslevels smell sight is more important than the bag in preventing an ugly situationif you experience a real catastrophic lipo event this bag might give you enough time to grab whatever fire suppression device you have to deal with the situation the bag is a bit like airbags and seatbelts in a vehicle  hope you never have to rely on device  but in the event a bad situation occurs the bag may be the difference between a major or minor loss  personally i wouldnt store charge or use  questionable lipos  dispose properly and invest in a replacement
was a little big and everyone laughed but i could fit everything in this thing and it would sit on my back side so it didnt get in the way for me  the only reason why i had to give it up was because my instructor said that if i wore this at clinicals i would spread germs from room to room without knowing it  i guess it very well could have however my shoes dont spread germs  my clothes  i had to stop wearing it but i save it for when i am done and a hospital lets me wear it  i can even put my stethoscope in it
the electric cord could be longer but other than that my boyfriend likes it it heats up well and relieves his neck and back pain being able to button it up to keep it in place is definitely a plus
i bought this and it came in perfect condition and right on timethis is a nice toy that is not to big and fun to use  it is very comfortable to use and enhances your experience  i was not disappointed with this at all
these inserts will stick to sandals  sandals need support for anyone
ive been overall happy with this not having to try to maneuver around a cord while using it has been very helpful and the battery last long enough for grooming jobs that can be done at home
these are gelatin based dimesized disks that are a babys first introduction to popping sugary sweet snacks into their mouthaccording to the package your baby can safely have these when they crawl with tummy off the floor pulls up to a standing position uses jaw to mash foods and uses fingers to self feed because they quickly dissolve they are probably one of the safest small foodsthey are relatively wholesome with milk products as the main ingredient and a healthy dose of potassium taste tested by meyucky taste tested by a 18 month oldyummythe problem i have and its a small one this product is ok in my book is that they seem to encourage parents to get kids started as early as possible to have sweet snacking habits i have a friend who thought it was fine to make her babys first food like this a fast food french fry this is a much better option
this product is fanastic i love the flavor and the fast acting that happens after you chew them the taste is great not chalky at all
i purchased this to make bubbles with for my 2 year old son the product did great and the bubbles were the strongest ive ever seen so much better than buying watered down soap from the store
easy to use and looks fantastic  do not worry the scale works fine  am super pleased with my purchase  only very small drawback for me was that fingerprints show easily but are easily removed with a cloth
this is the only powder i use in my dishwasher  have tried others but they do not clean as well
i absolutely love this it works perfectly
easy to assemble easy to operate gives a great infrared session directly where you need it shipped promptly  good price would purchase again
beautiful stone but it did not really work for me i think i am better off buying these in person i have had better luck
quality product  good price
i saw and bought this product at vitamin shoppe because it had 5 atp royal jelly and several other really good ingredients ive taken nootropics by a very reputable company but they changed their formula and its not as good as it was beforei took one pill before lunch to see what type off effect it would have on me it didnt seem to have any kind of effect on me so i felt confident in taking the 2 tablets as prescribed before breakfast with 8oz of water i didnt notice any improvement on my focus but i didnt get my 4pm slump instead i got a severe debilitating headache i made sure i was hydrating really well by 6 and 7pm my muscles in my entire body began to ache especially around my mid back and i got ringing in my ears ibe ringing in the ears usually means something with the kidneys  i went to bed and continued to drink lots of water and tried to get some sea salt in me to keep my electrolytes in balancethe following day after 13 hours of sleep i usually get 5 i woke up without the headache and almost all of the pain in the back had subsided except between my shoulder blades i felt very light headed so i made sure to continue to hydrate and eat well had i felt the way i did i took the two tablets i would have gone to the hospital i dont go to the hospitals i was that sick from thistheres a lot of ingredients in this supplement proceed with caution the risks definitely outweighed any possible benefit im a super healthy person so i cant imagine what might happen to someone who is not in as great of shape as i am
love this product full of protein and fiber and taste greatmy daughter even loves it  i add bananas blueberries all kinds of fruitsand it fills me up as well
screw and parts they arrived in new condition i carry one in my car backpack nightstand etc cheap and effective
this plastic bucket was just what i was looking for  something i could fill up with warm to hot water and soak my feet in while i am sitting on the sofa watching tv at night  my feet fit in it perfectly and i wear 95 mensfilled about 34 of the way with water it can get heavy but the handle doesnt feel flimsy  dont fill to the top or else water may splash out as you carry it  the bottom has little massaging bumps  kinda like reflexologyif you are the type to balk at paying 1518 for a plastic bucket this is not for you id recommend you get two rubbermaid buckets and use those instead  sometimes you have to splurge and get the thing that best fits your needs and is designed for the purposethis bucket does not keep the water hot or warm  it is just a plastic bucket but it should be enough for a good 1520 min soak if you start with water thats hot enough
beautiful pendulum and received close to pictured
excellent  best microfiber cloth for cleaning eyeglass lens leaving them without streaks
sorry but this one is a bust the plastic is too hard and not flexible enough wont stay closed around my hair cant imagine it working for anyone
good dealprice does what it was designed to do cant really elaborate
i didnt expect so many herbsthe package came in very quickly aswell happy buyer
didnt seem to do anything for me
i commend the seller magickal night the shipping was quick and arrived earlier than anticipated likewise they very safely packaged the item which is encouraging to purchase from them again7 sisters of new orleans glory water is what it is a mass manufactured spiritual product 7 sisters of course is one of the 4 or 5 other brands that indiowisdom owns which originally were small independent companies therefore there is a caveat to their item eg formulas got standardized between brands some things smell the same but have different packaging however these specialty items arent as terrible as ive found likely because if its a unique item then there isnt some cost effective equivalent to sell as a dupe this may also be why wisdoms own website has listed glory water as out of stock for almost a year if not morethe sent of glory water is nice somewhat sweet and colognelike unfortunately the scent easily dissipates when its sprinkled or dabbed on anythingoverall im not dissatisfied and is a nice addition to my spiritual supplies collection
item has too much of a bend in it to be used ccomfortably
i wanted to try these brackets both to create more space for breathing while wearing a mask and also to prevent my makeup from getting on the mask  unfortunately i found these a little tricky to use  they are kind of bulkyyou can see them poking out of the top of my mask plus you can see the bumps and ridges under the mask which looks a bit weird  but despite their bulkiness they were also a little small for my face shape as they kept slipping off my nose  and they didnt make it easier to talk as they moved even more with speaking  i might use these for certain situations but overall i wouldnt recommend them
i got one of these for myself a few months ago because i read they can help with scalp itch i dont have dandruff but i do have dry scalp thanks winter and some irritation due to using dry shampoo admittedly it felt weird to use at first but after just the first use my scalp was itching less after i added the use of an apple cider vinegar clarifying shampoo the itchy scalp is gone it has made a noticeable difference in terms of scalp itch and how clean my hair looks and feels i was excited and told my husband about my triumph over itchy scalp and the next thing i know he has started using my shampoo brush even though he made fun of me for using it in the first place he has some dandruff but doesnt have the itchy scalp im not sure if it has helped him or not but he must enjoy using the brush because he keeps using mine this is the exact reason i have now bought a second one we both enjoy using it
in the description you get easy to use it has two fixing clips on both sides and you can hang the 3d bracket on the face cover to prevent sliding then put on the face cover as usual no you cant further down you will see that they recommend either sewing it in place or using double sided tape i was able to wear mine without any complications
knocks out all my aches  pains
ive tried a view this one tastes good and dissolves more easily than others ive ordered again already many thanks
i like that it doesnt bother my digestive track
resolve your rug cleaning problems we purchased our own steam cleaner a few years ago and found this cleaner to beat all the rest  anyone who has self cleaned their carpets knows  the products they use makes a big difference in how many times they have to go back and forth this resolve concentrate 2x does the trick cleans up spills and  leaves such a clean smell
i like the value of getting ten boxes at once and you cant go wrong with puffs
they arrived well packaged and they are excellent value for the 10 pack
this makes my skin feel so nice and clean also super soft afterwards i love it  def worth it and youre not going to find it cheaper anywhere else
i bought this for my teenage daughter and she says it worked out very well for her hair her hair is curly and wavy but the drying works really well and she is able to style her hair accordingly there are three different measures of heat and she finds the medium and high features to work best for her overall  great purchase so far
this is by far the best glue out there  stays long and is waterproof  great for someone like me who is active
my daughter is the one who really uses selfiesticks and anything that will help her make movies with her iphone  she likes this selfiestick tripod a lot and especially that it has a place to hold the remote  the bluetooth connected easily to her phone and she was soon taking pictures with her phone in it  it doesnt go as high as her other iphone tripod but its very portable  the tripod legs are kind of short and the stability is not real good but it will do  she will be using this for class projects where she has make movies or video tape home physics experiments
great flavor do have to worry a little about getting to the bathroom
these are not individually wrapped so i cant use them as they are to give my dog medicine when i get them from the vet they are individually wrapped
slim lightweight pocket umbrella its size and weight make it easy to slip in a coat pocket or handbag it is a regular umbrella not particularly sturdy when the wind gusts in new york city the wind tunnels can be brutal and have ruinedinverted all but the sturdiest umbrellas i still have to put this to the test i suspect it will be similar to drugstore umbrellas
fits well on my average sized female head  i keep it in the freezer for use whenever i need  i was almost scared to use it for fear it would be too tight but it is not too too tight and the compression feels goodi recently had an 18 hour migraine triggered by sleeping wrong on an old neck injury  the type of pulsating headache that no amount of changing positions in the bed would relieve the pain  light and sound were unbearable  i cannot take any meds for my migraines so i use a variety of supplements showers ice heat etc to try and bring comfort a nice tool in my migraine arsenal toolbox  i rotate it out with other things and it helps take the edge off  with this last spell this compression cap was just the ticket  it allowed the pain to numb just a hair and i fell into a much needed mini nap  that was the beginning of the end of the this particular migraineno complaints or regrets
better than the more expensive kind i was getting that were jammed in a box and hard to use i dont need a industrial weight bag so there work great and for less money  delighted
really was excited to get this product due to the practically of it then i received the productpro very well made  qualitygreat designcons priceyvery heavylarge devicei rated this item three 3 stars for these reasons the weight of this product limited me to carry my medications on me which was the whole reason i purchased it and secondary the price of the productupdate  i have received a personal phone call from the owner we talked about her product line and during the conversation she really showed me her commitment to customers and designing great productswhen ordering just make sure you get the appropriate size that is going to meet your needs also if weight is going to be a  consideration than i would suggest ordering a device in titanium i am awaiting a new titanium dual camber device i will update after i compare the products side by side
these protect the placard from bending in the heat etc  a good clear way to protect the placard and easy to see and hang in the car
myclub wont let me tan unless i have eyeweari put these on my keychain with mycomputerpass and bingo never without
i like shower poufs have used them for decades now its rare to find black ones my favorite color these are reasonably soft softer than some ive bought at the grocery store theyre very big and dense almost but not quite too big to hold onto ive nearly dropped one several times but always managed to maintain my grip i would probably prefer these a bit smaller but since theyre in my favorite color i wont complain too much they hold a lot of soap and build lather well
originally i was taking the one a day trunatal ginger gel capsules and i was so disappointed that they were discontinued i found these and im happy to say they work just as well if not better give them a try if you suffer from morning sickness or nausea for any other reason
very satisfied with the scooter i have problems with my feet and stress fractures i bought the scooter so i would have it if i needed it and not have to rent one
this is a great little toner the spray has a fine little mist and works very well i cleanses my face beautifully and feels very refreshing when i use it after i use this my face feels nice and clean i do like the smell of this and feel super refreshed every time i use this i do like that this has witch hazel in the ingredient list which is a very calming ingredient it also has other fantastic ingredients like chamomile and ginsengthis is a great find and am happy i found this toner
this product is very quiet you dont know its on the price was right with the 3000 coupon it also has a 2 year warranty that you have to register before 30 days after purchase
i have no idea if this works or not so i dont know how to rate it
this smells so good i use it for shaving and its such a great value it doesnt leave a residue like a lot of the lower end baby oils and its a pretty large bottle
im incredibly disappointed in this product after 2 weeks of using this diffuser its already brokendoesnt work ill add the water and essential oil and after 2 minutes of being on it turns itself off ive tried plugging it into different outlets and selecting different settings and it still does not work
i love the color there is no smell which surprises me because most of the other natural nail polishes i have tried do have smell the only thing i dont like is how fast it chips it doesnt really stick to the nail maybe if i get a great base coat it will stay better
i love the sleek black color of this stretcher there are no instructions in the package but information is available here on the site google cervical traction and you will find examples exercises and more information as always make sure you are in communication with your doctor or chiropractor to make sure youre on the right paththe last neck stretcher i used was plastic with foam around it and naturally the foam disintegrated over time i appreciate this stretcher which seems to be a very dense foam the sides seem to push on my occipital bones to encourage a stretch i make sure that the base is right against my shoulders so those little points are in place i only use for 1015 minutes at a time usually at the end of the day this helps me regain curvature in my neck to compensate for my desk job i love this particular model and enjoy using it to relieve neck tension after work recommended
my acupuncturist used this oil and i have continued to use itgreat product
i got this because it says that its flavored portable and figured it would be good to add into my water bottle during hot  yoga it tastes gross and you need a comedic amount of drops if you have a large water bottle  its not that i am not used to the taste of stevia it just has a bad berry flavor the bottle also isnt portable its pretty big probably because you need so many drops to make it work if it leaks then youve got another mess on your handsstick with nuun tablets they taste a lot better one does the job and they are in a portable container that cant spillthis is bitter and id use it if i were sick or something but its really a slight degree away from pedialyte
nice size picks up dus like a pro comes with extra refill
sealed my granite put on two coats and still have a lot left over i would recommend
i like plastic frames but they slide off my nose when i am working and looking downward i thought i was going to have to get the side pieces extended but i saw this and it works perfectly  although they seem a little flimsy you get ten pieces works like a charm perfectly comfortable
this replacement brush is just like the real clarisonic brushes i was pleasantly surprised how well they worked and also the pricecant be beatyou will not be disappointed
great replacements convenient order from amazon with great price
we need alcohol pads and these where a great price for the same item that we had purchased before in smaller volume  fast delivery
i had at once gavin this a 3 star now im giving it a one star all of my pastries stick to this paper i just made french macaroons and they stuck so bad they tore apart what a waste of time and expense i bake all the time now i have to go back and search for the sheets i purchased over a year ago they worked wonderful no sticking at all these sheets even look and feel different then the other brand no i dont recommend
nice and comforting
the advertisement says five pack per box i received a ziploc bag sealed with for only four i tried it on their comfortable there nice nice color but theres not side theres four
this thing is amazing you can use it dry or in the tub with water it is gentle but does a wonderful job of smoothing heels
helps along with other powdered supplements
this product is amazing  i have tried many many creams lotions special socks microplaners and anything else that advertises they can get rid of your cracked heels  nothing has worked even at the nail salon i have never left satisfied with how my heels felt i had resigned myself to the fact i was never going to have smooth feet again  but this thing works  i read reviews where people said it stops if you push down on it well there is a reason for that if you push too hard you can hurt yourself its a safety mechanism that makes sense just be patient and it will work  ive used it three times since christmas even though my heels were still pretty smooth i just like the way it feels  if you have rough feet you will be amazed at the snow shower you create using this  put down a towel or something to catch all the lovely dead skin that comes showering down  buy this  you will love it
makes my glasses cleaner than other products ive used small bottles make it easy to take in purse or keep in desk
these are nice little travel packs to bring along in a pinch when you are out of smaller tooth paste and mouth wash plus a small size of spritz breath spray these packs are very small and easy to store and bring along these work pretty well i am not a huge fan of the breath spray but that is just because i dont generally use them so i wish they would have included more mouth wash and tooth paste since those i use a lot more
i have bought this product 3 times i was perfectly satisfied with the first two orders but the most recent september 2022 is clearly different the floss is thinner and shreds easily it slips from my finger even when wrapped around five times in a word the floss is useless
great fit great feel
good value for your money i have reactions to some contact solution but this works well for me i use optifree as well
had  for awhile now and it  hasnt fallen apart so all is well
i love this bracelet perfect fit for ladies with small wrists i were it all the time even in water and has not tarnished
this thing has got some power  it does a nice job gently removing callous  i was even able to carefully remove a callous between my toes that has caused me pain for a long time  pain is gone  i recommend it  its been worth every penny to me so far
it works really well totally eliminated the dogs odor he has his own gated area of the back of our kitchen that always smells not when this is plugged in and we have a large open kitchen just make sure its near the source
i have the galaxyd color option which includes 2 adult size masks and 4 pm25 filters the galaxyd color is a blue green and teal nebulathe masks have adjustable ear loops but no bendy nose pieces however the cut of the masks does keep them in place over my nose without the need for the nose wire the masks also go under my chinthey pass the candle test the masks have three layers of fabric even without a filter in place the outer layer with the nebula print a white lining and the filter pocket the filter pocket is open on both sidesat the longest point the masks are about 10105 inches the widest point from nose to chin is about 555 inches i took these measurements after washing the masks in warm water and line dryingthe masks are quite large on my face i usually wear smaller masks the sides on these go nearly to my ears and i have the ear loops adjusted to be as small as they can gothe masks are made in china
product is was described
these are hard to find in a store exactly what i was looking for thicker longer and higher quality
cheaper than the tool truck and same great fit
this hot water bottle has thicker walls than most ive owned which is really nice the texture of one side actually helps keep you from getting too hot and adding the hot water bottle sweater helps even more if you want moist heat just add a damp washcloth between the hot water bottle and its sweater just remember to empty it after use and do not microwave it
i cant find better words to describe how glad i am to have discovered this product than to say  it saved my dogs life hallelujah
works well with the phillips electric toothbrush
these worked very good we were having issues with safety glasses fogging up while wearing our covid masks these lasted a long time and worked great
great straws just as described and i feel good about not buying plastic ones anymore especially after watching those sad sealife videos online of plastic in the ocean they are stylish too
much to my shock and thanks to my sister for championing this product and delighted surprise this is the first protein shake that i can actually say i truly like and enjoy drinking  i admit i do use milk in the mix but i didnt even try water and its a pleasure to drink a fivestar yum
updateitem did not make the 2 month anniversary  for this reason i have updated the ratingthis water pik for teeth is what i wanted  with 3 speeds it meets my every expectation  my gums are benefiting from the pulsating action  it keeps the extraction area clean low setting where the brush seems to miss
purchased this product a second timedoes work and open skin pores
i am wearing masks everywhere i go i have been searching for the holy grail of masks i have used the pieces inside the mask that are supposed to make it more comfortable and cooler doesnt work  i have tried the k95 masks even one that gives you a daffy duck look and other k95 that are more comfortable i have used home made cloth masks and none keep me from fogging up my glasses or allow me some coolness when i talk i think i am claustrophobic
this stuff works great for tough stains on baby kids and adults clothes it removes everything baby food formula spit up stains even old spit up stains even with little scrubbing and even stains from blow out diapers i will never use another stain remover again just this one
i am not all that happy with liquid detergents and when i first found a detergent strip that i could tear off of a set of four and throw in my washing machine i was hoping for a good result  and they work great  i saw this one and figured id try a different brand and these work great as well  i love that they are small and nonmessy easily stored and if i was going rving and needed to wash clothes these are easier to take into a laundromat  dont even have to take the box  just grab one or two depending on how many clothes you need to wash in 1 or 2 machines  so much easier than dragging around a bottle of liquid detergent or paying an exorbitant amount of money for one of those tiny ones at the laundromat  maybe these arent for everybody but for me they work great to clean my clothes and are much easier to store and use
i really enjoy dripdrop when needed  i cant locate this product in my area so i order from drip drop through amazon  its purpose is to hydrate and  i think it works well
i have to have a bandage that doesnt stick to the wound
this sponge does not work i scrubbed and scrubbed but nothing came out from my skin i just saw my skin was red from scrubbing so hard dont buy this item i tossed them in the trash what a waste
good size but a bit pricey for a sponge  ok if it holds up as my former one did
was good product east to install stick and twist even i could do it with arthritis in my hands it mad reach for handheld a joy
great earplugs at a great price i use these for shooting and they do great ive shot all calibers including 50bmg and havent had an issue i also love the cord because i can take one or both out and it doesnt get lost it just hangs down or around your neck if you value your hearing and work around loud machinery or shoot often these are great earplugs to use
they fit nicely some of the oral tips you have to fight to get them in not with this one
not what i expected beard to pump up i am returning it
i use this to brushclean my cats teeth and they work better than i expected i can use the same sponge 5 to 7 times without having it break considering how sharp cats teeth are my cat does not resist so is an easy process i dont need to maneuver the sponge in a forceful way at all when it breaks just cracks so far i havent had a sponge breaking into pieces i use it moist with the teeth cleaning spray they sell for pets i have never used it dry
not sure why people say these are too small  they are the exact right size for me  ive bought these glasses a couple of times over the past decade and theyve held up well  the lens are distortionfree ang the frames are attractive and strong  exactly what i needed
not for tender skin but it is the best joint pain reliever
exactly like the kind i buy in the store for a fraction of the cost theyre also easy to cut down to size to fit different sized soles or heels
i bought this product to try removing the soft peach fuzz on my face  ive previously used a disposable razor and microblading tools and was looking for something that was more effective and efficienti tried both the razor function and the epilator function  the directions contained in the box were clear and easy to understand  i appreciated that it came with paper instructions instead of many items now that do not and require you to watch a video online  the paper instructions were much easier to take in my bathroom as i tried for the first time instead of my laptop and a videoi tried both functions on my arm first the high speed of the epilator was a bit uncomfortable  tried on my face  tried the razor first  then changed to the epilator i first tried on low and then on high  mistake  the machine literally caught my skin in it when on high speed  it cut the surface of the skin and left a mark like a cat scratched my facesee photo  that was iti was done no morethere are 2 detachable pieces to switch between depending upon whether you want to use razor or epilator mode  they easily come off  its clearobvious how to align each piece and attachcouple of notesonoff button is stiff to use  it doesnt glide onoff  not a problem  merely fyicomes with batteries  that was a plus because it saved me a few more the device is a bit loud in my opinion  you could not discreetly use this productwas difficult to use in the jaw line which is the area i most wanted to use it oni will not be using this device again  i will go back to using my inexpensive micro blading tools
its so quiet you almost forget it on i have 3 cats and a dog so im sure the house can smell like pets i walk into the room and its just so fresh
cane is very stable and strong it is worth the price
definitely one of the best natural sunscreens out there and i have tried many it rubs in well of course it has a different texture than chemical sunscreen without leaving a white film smells great and works awesome we just gave it the real test in the florida sun and water no sunburn
this does just what it claims to do  love it
i just moved back to an area where im close to an old and very dear friend that i kept in touch with for all the years i lived far away so now that im near i wanted to give her something that she would enjoy and i know how much she enjoys a long leisurely bath  a nobrainer to get bath bombs then  this is a beautiful set that i know she will be happy to receive and thrilled to use once she can lock the bathroom door kidsthey always want to bother mom when shes trying to get a little me time and relax for a time  i love these  for her and others  but i cant take baths any longer as i have health issues that make it difficult for me to get out of the bathtub from that position  i dont envy those who can take a bath  i know my friend will enjoy the bath bombs just as i would if i could
its good in theory but hanging the arms is kind of inconvenient and the rotating shiatsu balls hurt in certain positions especially when they hit my spine it hurt enough that i returned it
easy to use smells great and its all natural  i love love method products
ive had it for just about 2 days thank you for getting it to me days before the initial delivery date i like everything about this chair so far save for 2 items the beeping every time you press a button honestly it is obnoxious and im on the hunt to disable it the turning radius is much larger than i am used to given i had an invacare tdx si this is just an adjustment i have to make to the chair so my mild frustration to it is on methe chair is comfortable it is quiet and i like the little storage bag way more than i expected to after years of just filling my lap getting it ready to use was very simple as well50lbs sounds lighter than it weighs lol itll be easier to go mobile than my old chair which was around 200lbs but it isnt as mobile as i thought it might be we will see how it goesbottom line is i am happy with my purchase had to come out of pocket for this because my old chair just decided nope not working anymore so i needed a replacement quickly
i bought these for a pair of dressy shoes  i usually wear the smart  but old looking orthopedic shoes but these were too darn cute to pass up  i really needed some more support but i honestly didnt expect a lot from these  even though they look simple they actually help a lot  they are very easy to use  simply stick them wherever you need them on the sole of the shoe with the preapplied adhesive  the set includes 3 different colors  but i really like the clear ones  you can barely even see them
save your money and buy a roll of bounty paper towels
it was a nice tray  smaller than i expected but my walker has  rubber grips and the tray didnt fit over it   now what do i do   buy a new walker   idk what to do to be honest  im assuming all trays will have the same issue due to those grips  companies should realize walkers come with grips and make the trays fit either or somehow
use it daily no issues and its been over a month
been using for several years  always does the job
i love tangy tangerine it has all the vitamins you will need good product
im glad this is organic because this powder is often used in traditional chinese medicine given how polluted china is i would distrust anything imported from that country but this one is certified usda organic which gives me some peace of mind you add a scoop to yogurt smoothies etc and its supposed to boost your immune system and improve chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension i dont like the taste but you are taking it for its medicinal properties overall its good quality and best for those suffering from chronic conditions
this is an upgrade from the cheap thin foamfabric shoe insoles it has a nice arch support and adhesive to keep insole in place the leather top also adds a premium feel  i have 3 issues with this product 1 its only a 23 to 34 long insole so your toes wont have any cushioning 2 lining up the insole to my low boots was not easy since the insole is a bit narrower than the boots i had to try several times before finding the best placement it would have been easier with flats with their more open footbed 3 the insole cushioning is limited due to the relatively thin insole
the pros 1 it has 15 different strains of good bacteria this is the most outstanding feature of this probiotic blend it is the case of more is better diversity of the gut flora means the healthier the digestive tract 2 it is delayed release  this ensures that the good bacterium gets into your lower intestines rather than being destroyed by your stomach acids 3 per serving it has 30 billion cfu of probiotic organisms again more is better 4 i have experienced no adverse reactions to the product 5 my overall digestion has improved resulting in good bowel movements and no constipation the con 1 it contains milk so if you have a diary allergy or intolerance you should not take this productin conclusion premiva ultra probiotic is a good solid product that would likely improve your digestion as well as boost your immunity disclaimer  i was fortunate to receive this complementary probiotic in return for my fair and honest evaluation i am under no obligation to give a favorable review i write these reviews in the hope that they will help other consumers like me to make the best purchasing decisions for their money as an avid researcher i have save myself time money and aggravation by reading other customer reviews and i am grateful to have their input available to me
holy sand paper i wont be using these on my babys perfectly soft tush these things feel like they could take the skin right off
adheres and stays put
smells woodsy like pencil shavings seriously i use it twice a day for a week and heel cracks are healing nice thick consistency without being gooey nice applicator doesnt stain clothes wash right out
i should have replaced the blades years ago they work excellent i even mowed some of those long gray wild chest hairs and outside of needing to clean out the shaver head repeatedly it worked changing the cutters is easier than it looks dont start prying on the little tabs just push the cutters down one at a time and slip out what a deal
this ddgro back brace is made sturdyit feels like there is 3 medal type of thin bars in the back that are comfortablei felt good wearing this  actually for my bad posturemy husband wears this when his back is sore or doing some gardening and lifting thingsmy husband wears jeans that are size 32 waist  and i wear a size 8 or 10 this brace is a large and a medium would have been to tight for ushope this helps
love love love this mask  all my previous sleep masks have had the classic velcro band that goes around your head well i just must have some abnormally large head because after about a month the band would stretch out so i would tighten it and it would stretch again eventually i would get to the last small piece of velcro that could still hold on however this created another problem the rest of the velcro would then get tangled in my hair not with this mask someone finally had the great idea to use adjustable ear loops instead i am so happy  this mask also has a smooth silky cool side and a warm side the only think i would change would be to  raise the material where the eyes are i dont like having the material press down on my eyes however i will deal with it because the good outweigh that small inconvenience love it
love the idea of compostable garbage bags i ordered these for our home for general use mostly in our kitchen garbage unfortunately these are useless because they have a defective thinning line going through middle that makes them tear even if something very light is inside of them otherwise could be a good bag but this specific batch of garbage bags i received are garbage
they serve the purpose my 85 year old mother in law couldnt unzip them honestly snack bags ftom the grocery store are just as good and cheaper
brilliant idea works perfectly the stickers on two of the boxes were incorrect customer service offered a new set fantastic service a must buy for tablet takers everywhere
definitely recommend    absolutely a must have for sore muscles
im giving this product three stars primarily due to the fact it is a knee scooter and the pad where you put your knee is not very much padding at all in fact its a willful attempted being a good pad and the covering that covers that is even worse with very little use my wife having had foot surgery the pad felt inadequate to begin and degrades very rapidly and the fake leather whatever the covering is on it is made of is like starting to crack and maybe as durable as a wet paper towel maybethats the bad stuff now the good stuff is in terms of mobility and functionality this thing offers quick release adjustment on the handlebars which is far far superior to most of the other brands which you have to take the pin all the way out unscrew it all the way take it all the way out adjust the handlebars and then you have to store it somewhere not very mobile in my opinion so this ones light years ahead of all of those  overall i have to say compared to what else is on the market this thing is a pretty good value for the money but it still leaves a lot to be desired having said that it is the one that we finally purchased similar to how we vote in the united states sadly we had to choose between the better piece of garbage
it doesnt do diddly squat the rasp is great  it has a coarse grind and a fine grind and it will do the job instead the nail brush is like any other it cleans your nails easily
still too big to swallow  id rather take two small pills than gag on one  why cant anyone come up with a fish pill us humans dont have to risk choking to death to swallow
i bought these because the bristles were charcoal and the rest of the toothbrush is bamboo  i liked that there was no plastic  the feel of the toothbrush is different but it works so well  my teeth felt cleaner  i loved it so much i bought another pack
before i had my daughter i went out on a limb and bought this as an in case for diaper blow outs and spit up stains i couldnt be happier it works really well i have found that sometimes i need to spray and soak for an hour or so and then do it again if needed if it doesnt come out after the first wash i end up filling my sink with hot hot water and dumping a little bit into the sink and letting it soak over night if its a really bad stain and it comes right out after that next wash my daughter just started solids which is a completely different stain than spit up and diaper blow outs but this stain remover works just as well
all around nice product good amount for the price i use in in skincare so i cant comment on taste i will buy this again
it gets hotwarm provides temporary soothing
perfect box for oils they fit perfectly
this is a great shaver  it gives me the closest shave ive ever had  im able to shave my head in the shower and it does a fantastic job its very easy to clean too although the first time it was a bit difficult to open up the heads  the instructions could be better and the pictures are a bit smallnote  to remove middle head turn counterclockwise just about 18 and then pull straight out
easy to  use
works well we have a european dishwasher that requires power not as good as the high end powder
ive had contacts for 20 years and always took good care of them at annual visits the doctor would always comment that he couldnt believe my 2 week soft contacts were over 4 weeks old they were so clean and looked great under the scope so when my new doctor recommended this due to my eyes battling dry eye and irritation from long dustydirty work days i figured id try it but wasnt expecting muchi am a vet and my eyes are bombarded with hair fuzz dust nail dust from the dremel and all kinds of things and my contacts are in from 6 am to after 10 at night most days i have to take out and rinse one at least once some days they just feel like something is stuck on them alllllll day  this treatment does seem to freshen them a bit nothing miraculous since i keep mine very clean but i use it weekly or as a last resort if one contact is really bugging me to see if its salvageable or ready to toss the peroxide is strong if you have a cut rash ezcema or something and you get some on your hand it will burn i rinse like crazy before i put them back in my eyes this one expires in under a year so i dont know if ill use it up with mostly weekly uses
my husband was tired of using tennis balls for his walker so he decided to try this option  the socks that go vet them for inside use ripped almost immediately  without the socks they scraped my wood floors  we ended up throwing them away
horribleleft my hair too puffy
i use this product for gut health
these gummies arent soft at all  they are hard and stick to the teeth  the flavor is good and the fiber is good but just much to hard
i am an older man i have tried many types of socks these are the very best i have ever used they are just the perfect fit nice and wide nice and tall perfect amount of springiness i had a tiny concern and their customer service is most wonderful in how they treated me they are a family owned business that has the customers satisfaction at the top of their priority list  these socks are worth every penny can you tell that i am a happy camper i had to add some additional information that might help others people that suffer from peripheral neurophy  know that some days you just do not want to or need to wear the heavy duty support stockings these naturally are not designed to be support stockings  however i find that they are absolutely amazing for light support they come upo to almost the knee  they have  just the right amount of elastic to keep them up all and all the best socks i have ever owned
truly speaking this is my favorite scent of all  thank you glade this scent is amazingly refreshing in my flat  highly recommend
so i found this product not to be that great my hair got tangled in it many times and also it did not heat well enough to make nice curls even after it was charged so i return it
bottles broke within a couple of months
i purchased these for my boyfriend and i to put date ideas on you could use for a variety of couple or best friend gifts they include the paper already inside each pill perfect gift idea
like this brand a lot and am happy i found it going to reorder again and keep taking this
love these bags
need to make left side cradle larger to accept phones with protectors
longer strip works wonderfully on my mcl injury stays in place much better than most lidocaine patches
awesome for my homemade deodorant easy to push up and convenient
ive had moringa tea beforeits been in the leaf form and in a sachet with an herbal teait tasted great and i wanted to reproduce at homethis moring  as its listed  is in a powder form its a very fine powderi was hoping to be able to add it to my tea and just stir it ini was able to get some moringa powder to dissolve into my tea  but not allthis powder is fresh and adds an earthy taste when usedthe bag has 100gms its recommended to use 5gms a day  i figured out that there is about 5gms in 1 tsp i wish this contained a scoop in the bag so i wouldnt have needed to figure it out on my ownthis moringa powder would taste good and mix well in a smoothie i think it would taste  good especially in a green smoothie  the moringa would compliment the taste of spinach andor kalei received this powder 122019 it was manufactured 102019 and it doesnt expire until 092021be careful when closing the resealable bag  the powder is very thin and can get in the zip closure making it difficult to make a full seal
a great concept  used these on a trip to singapore tsa compliant i found i had to use more than one sheet  a single sheet didnt seem to create any cleaning atoms in the sink once i got 23 sheets per sink i was satisfied with the result
i bought this as a gift for my mom it was at the very least a bit of a pain to put together and cheaply made  it required electrical tape and a good bit of cursing  is now working ok  the grill is cheap plastic  it is bright and helps an elderly woman to read better
i had a very expensive dental guard made by my dentist it was extremely uncomfortable and would end up taking it out after just a hour or so i looked for alternatives on my own that wouldnt cost me hundreds of dollars i came across this guard and i couldnt be happier now i dont grind my teeth at night
fine lotion for dry skin  works very well on all parts of our bodies
seems to be well made and fits as expected my daughter is very happy with it
it should have had the flat back but everything else was great
the best safest way to kill weeds  mixed with a cup of salt and some dish soap a very fast acting way to get rid of weeds does not affect the soil negatively now i keep a couple of gallons on hand weeds ate always popping up
the only problem i have is with the top and the fact it doesnt have a specific tip for pouring it
these chill very fast and are comfortable
love this product it really works  and tastes delicious
this thing is hugei wasnt expecting that it will hold like 10 pills i only have three so its much more than i wanted
very useful tool soft and easy to use  very easy to clean
i often like to accentuate colognes with essential oils and this is a perfect essential oil blend for the summerive found this blends perfectly with spice bomb as it has citrus notes alreadythe applicator makes putting the appropriate amount of this oil on easy  i just add a bit to my wrists and neck prior to spraying my cologneive really enjoyed this essential oil blend and definitely recommend itthanks for reading my review  i enjoy writing them as i value reading others reviews when im making a buying decision  i regularly update my reviews to reflect any changes i may discover and to include helpful tips you may need if you purchase the product  i will always make every effort to answer any questions i can as it is my pleasure to help
love it i organize the whole month bought 6 of them
i immediately put these in a small crock pot and got them really hot too hot at first they hold heat really well long after you are ready to move on i dripped some essential oils on them and i think they absorbed them these are about the size of your whole palm one of my kids dropped one and it didnt break thank goodness
doesnt really hold well compared to other mattifier creamsat least for men who doesnt apply makeup over it
i used these before i gave birth to collect colostrum and take with to the hospital they worked great and did fine holding up in the freezer you can really put a date on them though so that part was a little frustrating tape didnt stick and you cant write on them
we love this detergent its perfect for our babies sensitive skin and leaves little to no scent i love that im able to order it and have it delivered to the front door so i dont have to leave the house it came with some tape on the top so there was no spill
nice sturdy brush bristles are are not too soft just right bought to replace another i ordered that was much too soft it could be just a tad longer but it does reach all of my back so does the job
ive been taking fish oils for years now on and off and i consistently come back to this trusted brand i have bought other brands but for the quantity value and the packaging glass bottle i stay with carlsons for me fish oil is not a pleasant taste but this brand has disguised as much as possible  with a lemon flavor which makes it easier i think this is my brand for life
feels more like a rag than paper towel i also love the designs
we live on a mint farm in the forest with lots of bugs and a pool  so this has been a real hit for my grandchildren and me  i also bought some for my grand kids to use at home  we live in the south near the water and beaches mosquitoes and gnats are our 34state bird34 and we live in the sun so this is a hit
misleading natural armor essential oils do not have organic certification simply saying they are organic does not make it so the company response to my query was if you dont feel comfortable with our company or our products simply do not purchase them buyer beware if you truly want organic
ive used amino derm for a long time it dries to a tight finish that makes my skin look very smooth and clear it does seem to break down oiliness and help reduce breakouts i like the herbal smell but some people might find it unpleasant this is a great product if you want natural organic skin care for your oily complexion
works just as described and as a little side effect sometimes young people teens say it emits a very high pitched whistle which we old people cant hear i tested by turning it off and on and asking them when they heard the noise maybe a dog whistle a lighter and a bottle opener
ive never used this type of mouthwash but am attracted to the concept and simple ingredients i took a gulp of water then took two droppers then swished it tastes fresh and minty without the burn seems effective for eliminating bacteria and odor per volume of prepared product i think this concentrate is a good value maybe a slight premium for a higher quality product
nice quality oil with a good scent to it  and its clean  will definitely purchase again
i had wls in 2013 and i absolutely have struggled so much getting enough of what i need its very difficult to manage usually i have to take a lot of vitamins to get all of what i should have and cant get as easily from food this ultimately makes me nauseous these are awesome i only have to take one vitamin to get all of what i need aside from iron which is absolutely wonderful compared to what i was having to do not sure how i lived so long without these total game changer these still can make me nauseous if i dont have them with food but thats likely due to just not having as big of a stomach so its really not a big issue if you have had wls please grab these and dont try and manage the vitamins on your own its so much trouble when you could just take something literally made for your needs
yookat medical arm sling this arm sling looked good in the photo so i ordered it it is evident it is made overseas and the instructions for use were difficult to understand after figuring out how to put it on i realized it is made to immobilize your arm and i mean totally immobilized others may find this sling comfortable but i did not it was painful to wear so i had to return it i ended up purchasing a standard arm sling at a big box store near me this was one of those purchases where i needed the convenience of a local store to be able to try on a sling in person and trade it in if it didnt fit without having to mail anything i found a standard sling that worked find for 15 at a local store amazon is still amazing but some things are best purchased locally depending on your immediate need
in my personal experience the product is pretty great it works best when used along with the many other product natural products inc offers see my review on their  glycolic facial cleanser here honestassortedreviewstumblrcompost147373883057glycolicfacialcleanserreviewthe toner does as it says and works much like expected i have no beef with this product overall great quality comes in great quantity awesome packaging superb overalldisclaimer free for reviewdear selleramazons system is glitching and so i havent been able to upload this review on the proper page i will move this review there as soon as amazon gets its act together but for now it has been added to my review on your other product found herehttpswwwamazoncomreviewrxj8wviyp1wvrefcm_cr_rdp_permim very sorry for this whole mess im sure it will be resolved soon as soon as it is i will more the review to its proper placethe following review is for the dual phase mattifying tonermy personal experienceive been reviewing insta naturals for a while noweverything from their cleansers to their tonersand ive come to really appreciate one thing about this business there are never really any unnecessary additives to their products and generally their stuffs made up of ingredients that are already known to have healing and soothing propertiesthe water feels just so like water however with lavander cucumber sage and calendula extracts it also has a soothing feel and you just know its great for the skinmajor tip try to not apply the product to open cuts pores or scars on the face it does have a mildvery mildsting but that may bother some more than othersdisclaimer free for review
this item is absolutely waste of money save your money and instal an actual ceramic coating it is advertised to repel water  but only clean water not rain water with dirt puddle of water on the road or snowi purchased total of 4 bottles in the span of 6months hoping that the layer of ceramic will get eventually thicken but on the 5th time i am gonna purchase this i realized that this does not dot make any difference as if you did not applied iti always have to spray wash my car after it rains other wise all the mud and dirt that came with rain water will stick in your car and even when you spray wash your car with clean water if you dont wipe it dry it leaves horrible looking water marks on the car and if you applied it but you didnt rinse off the dirt caused by rain then your car gets exposed to the sun it causes all the dirt to stick to your car paint makes it even harder to wash your carso just an advice from someone who wasted a lot of money and time for this product just save your money and invest in an installation an actual ceramic coating on your car do not waste your money and time with this fake spray stuff that does not do anything its all an illusionotherwise feel free to try it and agree to everything i said about this product
i only wish the doors would spring all the way open but i like that they rest open unlike many other pill boxes  it seems sturdy at day 1
this sound machine comes with a total of 36 sounds ie 6 each of fan white noise nature ocean tones like rain and thunderstorm and hypnotic sounds this is not battery operated it is packaged with a usb cable the unit itself and a regular instruction pamphletoperation is simple as per my video all the controls except for the timer slider and light are in the front of the unit i have to hold press the on  off button in the front to turn it on and do the same to turn it offthere are 6 operational buttons  on the front from left to right the down arrow moves to the next sound mode the broken circle cycles through the sound in the current sound mode the onoff button is in the center and then the minus decrease and plus increase buttons control the volumea tap on the top of the unit turns on the nightlight there are three  states of light on light absorption breathing light and light off if i press hold it will change the brightness despite what i said in my video i discovered that if i lightly press the onoff button while the sounds are playing it will suspend the current sound and i will be able to operate this as a nightlight only without the sounds i did not think i could do thatthe timer slider in the back has only a 30 or 60 minute option or continuous running mode there is also a headphone jack on the back to the right of the port of the usb cablein summary the sounds on this unit are crisp and clear it has a larger selection than many units on the market the nightlight is a nice touch but i wish they had colored lights and i wish this was battery operated no ac adapter is included for the usb cable but most people will have one in their house  the current price of 2799 is competitively priced for this know that there will never be more than 36 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds only a few of them will ever be played i am partial to the sounds of nature myself
i dont like that its stated as a massager and its not  misleadingi do like the red light therapy with the heat that this device has  i know red light therapy is great to help with circulation  have been using red light therapy for a few years now  so i like having a device specifically for my neck areadoes heat up nice and its soothingbut if youre looking for a massager this isnt it
so far i really like it  the seller sent an email on what to do when the brush arrives and how to care for the brush  so far no hair has fallen out  i really like it  only problem is that the brush is just a little thick to easily use it with the perfecto  brush standit has been a bit over a week now and i love the brush  it is way better than the cheap ones ive had before
i thought the 34adjustability34 of this shoe horn would be good  and it might have been except for the spring just above the horn  it makes the shoe horn completely unusable as it bends at the spring  so your foot wont slide into the shoe  if you need a little extra length because bending over is an issue definately go for the solid long handle  i just pitched this one and purchased a solid long handle shoe horn  works like a dream  for the life of me i cannot imagine how anyone thought this one would work  garbage
this is like a rollon perfume only its infused with essential oils instead i love the scent of freshly squeezed orange juice so i adore this scent it smells fruity but the predominant scent is orange it feels great putting some of this on after a nice refreshing shower on the downside if you use too much you do feel a slight greasy residue on your skin so i would use it sparingly like a perfume but overall i like it
this is far better than drinking the teas  i do not enjoy tea or the taste  so this is a great addition to my detox days  just pop a pill and i can instantly feel like i am more focused and less bloated  i do not get the sudden urges to use the bathroom i am eased into going  my skin is clear my stomach is less bloated and i have more stamina
i have been enjoying this little sonic face cleansing gadget i havent any prior experience to these facial cleansing brushes always seemed to be spinning style and i didnt not want that style but i pretty much knew what to expect and understand how it works the soft silicone surface is the cleaning brush area and it is static vibration behind it gives action to the silicone bristles and it gently provides cleansing power there are multiple vibration options with a short press of a button long press to hold on auto memory features remembers your last settingas with any skin cleansing brush if you have a face full of make up plan to remove it with a cloth first the idea being that bristles and massage could work it down into pores your  experience school of thought may varythere is no need to press hard against skin just let it glide i use small gentle circles over a wet face slathered in skin cleanser i dont wear much in make up but i always wear sunscreen and other layers of skin care i often double cleanse because of this usually an oily balm followed by a cream cleanser i have dry skin for this i have been skipping the first cleanse with an oil balm and just using the cream cleanser figured for testing purposes to keep it the same for several usesand no it doesnt create lather bubbles it isnt a circulating brush stationary silicone brush with vibration behind it but it cleans i thought well is it just a hand held soft scrubber how could it be better than a wash cloth it is so much better than a wash cloth and so much more gentle and more hygienicmaybe other kinds are better but i can only tell you my experience and thoughts on this avjone sonic facial cleansing brush and is a budget friendly option toomaybe it will vary among users but my skin felt and looked clean not only that but i have been really enjoying the experience of using it my night time skin care routine in particular is a sacred time i aim to enjoy it rather than see it as a chore so i enjoy using more pamper worthy products tools hair bands etc me time and this has added to my experience it is relaxing the whether i use the vibration at lowest setting or highest it has a calming sensation i use it on face neck and chest  the recommended time for cleaning is 1 minute and it will turn off after 3 i go almost the full 3 since i am adding in my neck and chestand i am taking it slowly no scrubbing rubbing or pressure just gentle circles around skinmy cleanser is massaged in it is moved around a little the nubs dont move in circles there is a vibration under them and then when all done i rinse my face and it looks so fresh bright clean i feelsee no traces left behind of sunscreen the lotion was effectively broken down by this it is a notable difference from hand washing or washing with a washclothso for me it works i am enjoying thisthe small device is comfortable in hand easy to use i like the base that it sits on there is a small hole for drainage  i rinse off the device after each use but dont dry it off so i like that it sit up perfectly in this basei really have come to like and appreciate silicone for use in cleaning my face and body seems so much more hygienicthe charger is usb on one end and a magnetic attachment at the device mine came charged and so other than an initial plugin to make sure it worked i havent had to charge it any i have used it 5 nights now each night for 23 minutes at a time debating on whether i canshould use it nightly or not charger may feel hot to touch and is normal do not charge for more than 24 hourswhen i do have to finally get around to charging it i will just have to lay it on a wash cloth or counter top the base is not for setting device in while charging i suppose maybe one day they could redesign the base to include both a drainage hole and a charging portps the direction state not to use it with claybased cleansers siliconebased or granular based cleansers exfoliating creams or scrubsuse cream cleansers oil cleansers water based cleansers the usual just not something that could damage silicone andor create too muchcombined friction on facethats it i like it as i use it more if i experience anything worth sharing i will be back to update
i previously bought a small set of dental tools to use at home for removing plaque between my routine office cleanings i ordered this set on a whim and im so glad i did it is so much nicer than my old set each tool is very sturdy and is longer than any of the tools from my first set the ones ive used so far work quite well it would have been nice to have included some instructions though because this set comes with a lot more than my old one which only had two tools plus the little mirror im not sure what some of these tools are for im sure they all have a specific special purpose i just dont have any idea what some of them are this set comes in a nice case for storage or travel im definitely glad i decided to get these
i have a smaller mouth and these are actually a good fit  at first i could only chew on them for a short time but slowly i have been able to build up my time with them  i like them lots better than the 25 one out there
bigger then i thought
just what ive been looking for
this smells amazing blends well all around surprisingly nice for a vegan protein powder it has risen to the upper ranks of hubbies favorite protein powders
i like it works as advertised not a perfect substitute for an honest to goodness paint touch up job but you must know that no wax product is that fantastical it does however mitigate very nicely the little speckly imperfections and tiny chippy marks in your blue paint i used this product in black when i had a 12 year old black vehicle and it worked great this blue is very good not as great as the black but on my nissan murano blue from 2007 it created a great improvement
i am using a combination of fasting and the adkins diet to lose weight and this helps me limit my calorie intake on the days i am fasting i generally try to stay under 500 calories on a 34fast day34 and this helps curb my hunger and they taste good
the product was delivered on time packaging was in good condition the product was in good condition and appeared to be as described and after use met expectations for fit form and function
my second purchase  every two years like clockwork i needs to renew my transformer  no more service alls  this 75 yr old grandma can do it herself  reasonable priced  quick professional delivery  perfect fit
seems to be working fine  no side effects
works perfectly on batteries
i probably wont use these since they werent expensive i probably wont return them but when i used them to block my wifes snoring unlike my anker headphones instead of silence i could hear my heartbeat and my own breathing so loud that was as bad as the snoring  the anker anc headphones while uncomfortable to sleep with give me a wonderful pure silence  im going to look for active noise canceling buds instead
i got this for my best friend for christmas as a 34gag34 gift and she loved it she uses it religiously the light really helps to find those hidden stones in the crannies of your tonsils the three different attachments really help as well
good refills for the journal
awesome for quartering ducks after the hunt
this was not for me the straps were too wide to fit under my arms comfortably
i just got this product today i was a little nervous that this product would taste like fish burps i had in the past from capsules of fish oil i took before i am very delighted to report that the flavor is very acceptable it tastes like oil with a slight lemon flavor the fishiness of the flavor is very slight and almost imperceptibleim going to take 2 teaspoons a day and see if that lowers my cholesterol which is now slightly too high ill update this review in the future
its naturalgreat for scalp
i loved the look of these bags  very blingy with three different kinds of glitter  silver gold rose gold they are not made of the usual thin paper and are meant to be reused not just thrown away after one use making them environmentally friendly which is a plusthe bags are on the small side however so they seem best suited for swag bags or intimate gifts of jewelry rather than large birthday or holiday presents this impression is solidifed by the fact that the bags come with tags saying thank you on them i wish there had been other tags included as well like seasons greetings or happy birthday this kind of limits their usefulness but its easy enough to include your own tag overall these are great for giftgiving
this cleans my tongue really well without leaving a metallic taste  i use the scraper every morning and it really helps me to wake up and feel like my mouth is crystal clean to start the day  i do dry it off after every use so that it does not rust and so far so goodas a funny note  i keep this in the same cup as my toothbrush head and if i lift my toothbrush head out at the wrong angle the magnet sticks to the scraper and they both come out together
it stays stuck to the wall of the shower for maybe two showers  any small bump and it falls off  does not hold the shower head except at one angle  would not recommend to anyone
i used these to block out my loud roommate when i was trying to sleep works great they are a bit difficult to wash but overall very handy i would purchase these again
no instructionswere added to the itemno how or when to use
great iron for getting your ferritin up
this product needs no soap it contains cleansers and a calming lavenderchamomile scent great for  a quick wash fabulous for any kind of travel easy to use
great product for your lungs
i mean cute but do not bend in the waist or tail only arms  as a result i cant really post them in anyway that looks realistic
the current price of 999 for this ensemble is excellent and the mask alone is worth that price however if the price were more than 1299 i would have rated this 2 or 3 stars due to the additional items includedthis comes in a giftable box and includes a sleep mask a silk eyeshade like another mask and disposable foam earplugs in a plastic casei am very impressed with the foam mask it is a cushiony soft but fullbodied sleep mask this mask has eye cutouts there is also an adjustable strap in the back since there is an eye socket channel i can open my eyes underneath without touching the front of it and it blocks out all light incredibly well it feels like it is made of cloth covered form it is comfortable to wear and fits me very well and is not too snug it does not move around when i lay down with it overall i really love the maskhowever the eye shade feels more like a lightweight silk mask even when i extend the adjustable strap all the way it pulls tight around my eyes is useless at blocking all light and is supremely uncomfortable the ear plugs are also just junk to me they should leave out both items i only took off one star because the mask is 5 stars if they left out the other junk i would have rated this 5 stars at the current price of 999
my husband says it works great for his back
i am a fairly regular soylent user the bottled 20 liquid  this is the previous version the dry 34you mix it justaddwater34 versionits not bad provided your expectations are set beforehandeven after copious shaking in the bottle there is a slight grittiness and texture that is nearly nonexistent in the 20 premixed  the flavor is different as well  the bottled 20 reminds me of the leftover milk after eating a bowl of cheerios  this v 18 dry mix the flavor is more akin to pancake batter  which is fine as long as you know that going in and dont find the taste of pancake batter unappealingall in all i prefer the taste and convenience of the 20 but can picture taking this on hiking treks where you are pumping water from a stream along the way and dont want to carry the weight  it should also store longer seeing as how it is a dry mix  great for putting away with your emergency supplies i would think
very useful when i steam veggies for more than one person three minute shot and done  very quick and easy to clean  i choose ceramicsas a healthy and attractive choicepreserving nutrients and making us think at least that the food is appealing  an alternative to overcookedboiled and tasteless vegetables  i also steam yams  its very quick and the result is moist and so tasty
perfect size works to relax muscles
i had attach these to two pieces of wood as we had several storms with pretty high winds that blew them off the house with on the wood i could keep them attached better
sizing way off  this is asian sizing not us sizing  an asian 14 is about equivalent to a us 6
really surprised how bad this product is all around considering its billed as the latest thing in teeth whitening hard to get the swabs out then handle is too shout for effective use worse yet it stings on the gums after the first use  makes teeth hurt even when not usingparticularly when brushing in addition it will not work on a synthetic tooth i have one in front that was shattered in an accuse replaced  is darker than my natural teeth this made things worse by slightly lightening the other teeth but not the dark one wish i could get my money backwhat a waste
husband wanted this for his wool socks they are like new again
not a bad suppliment at all helps relieve some aches and pains in my knees over all a good suppliment
i love the taste its very good
moms podiatrist recommended this for her and it works fine
i only use this on my shower curtain and to scrub the floor with my batter powered brush   does a great job
monoi smells awesome but i can only smell if the air vents are blowing high its not a freshener that can be smelled when you enter a closed up vehicle for the price i wouldnt recommend or buy again
i cant make up my mind whether these are good for the environment or not theyre meant to be disposable but only after youve used them a number of times they look like paper towels but are thicker with some of the durability of a rag yet because they look like paper towels its fairly easy to toss them out accidentally after only one use if you forget i know i didthese are good if you remember not to toss them out after one use  so i suppose theyre no worse or better than rags which you must toss out eventually at any rate anything disposable no matter how many times you reuse it is not good for the environment but if you must use something like a paper towel i suppose you could do worse than these
im a big fan of mushrooms  the more i use this stuff the better i feel  im 67 and like how clearheaded i feel when i take it regularly also it contributes to a better flow of energy throughout the day
exactly as described works well
excellent quality good amount great price fast shipping  definitely buy again thank you
definitely a different texture than regular baking soda  silkier and less clumpy if youve ever opened one of the ones that come with suction cups for the fridge its the same kind i wish the holes were a little smaller or even better that there were two sets of holes so i could pick how quickly it comes out that being said its very convenient
served purpose for which intendedused to hand wash dishes while kitchen being remodeledwithout sink
this is okay but i went back to prebiotin powder prebiotic
scratchy topstitching along edges  we have to cover the pad with a doublefolded queensized sheet to make a smooth surface for our little girl to sleep on  it does the job of protecting the mattress from moisture  she seems to be staying dry at night otherwise i would return this
love this veggie scrubber easy to wrap fingers around and get a good grip love that its wooden
matys is the best chest rub i have found after 15 years of being a mom and 4 children nothing i have found works better in addition to so thing a cough and cold it is very calming the all natural ingredients dont leave a greasy feeling in irritate the skin we dont only use it for illness we use it when my children the 15 12 9 or 4 year old are feeling anxious or sleepless on the chest and feet you will be amazed  i never want to be without this so i keep a backup jar in our medicine cabinet at all times
so heres what happened  purchased six of these at costco i fogged the yard with maybe two and a half i went from tons of mosquitoes to none no bites nada i had no issues for almost a week i was singing this things praisesa week or so after this the mosquitoes are back i break out another two cans and spray theyre back in about thirty minutes we move insidea week after this i open my car up therere 12 or so that fly in and i spend a very disturbing ride to daycare being told by my 4yo theyre on my 2yo and having to stop and kill some fairly large skeeters my yard has now bred super skeetersi get back home theres a swarm wade out into the swarm armed with two cans of this and spray my backyard smells like pledge i didnt see one of them drop i mean i was spraying this directly into a mass of flying mosquitoes and other than some course correction for getting soaked nothingi got some of the nonnatural cutter hose attachment spray and wiped out the hoard with two bottles i will mention this to costco next time im over there and see if im the only one
love the length makes it so much easier to reach the back of my head the one flaw that bugs me every time is that the power button sits right were my thumb goes when holding it upside down so im constantly accidentally turning it off its annoying but once you get used to it you can avoid it
i started using this product back in november and it has only been a few months and the iron has stopped functioning it does not get as hot as it did in the first couple months it simple stays warm but not warm enough to iron your hair save your money and time and invest in an iron that may cost a little more but will last much longer and the return window they provide is not long enough to test out whether or not the iron works very disappointed
one towel to clean and one to dry what a pain
dont understand the hype didnt moisturize my lips at all threw it away
i cant give an honest opinion because my doctor prescribed a larger dosage than the otc brands
cant hear at all with these
only issue with this tissue package group is that there are quite a bit fewer in box nowso run through boxes like water
nice product  but beware that cornstarch can cause fungal growth yet breathing and applying talc has a whole other set of problems
hubs swears by this stuff  he used to always complain about his neck being stiff and sore and says its been fine for a long time since taking viva glucosamine every day  he even asked me to put it on regular refill order  i take it when i can remember too and it seems to help my crackling knees
this was a nice back support but the straps would get to loose due to the material and it sliding on my shirt i also got to big i am 55 150lbs and got xl it does depend on your jean size on most measurements i would say not just weight i am an 1113 xl was to big and i couldnt tighten it on my own it comes with an extender for the waist part so i wouldnt be to concerned about it not fitting to tight in the tummy  i just would rather have something super tight to make me stand up straight it is a nice back brace if you get the right size
cute whatever it takes to make the kids brush
highly recommended to buy
i have yorkies with notoriously bad teeth i bought this item to try to help keep them clean it said for small dogs so i bought it not sure what they consider small but this toy is huge and bigger around than their mouths it has a gross plastic smell neither dog would get near it im giving it to the neighbor for her big dogs
my daughter actually takes this for vitiligo because it has most of the supplements she needs between this and the additional supplements we are seeing improvements i have to believe this is contributing
not too bad at all the suction works just fine but the part to hold the shower spray is too small to be a more secure way to hold the shower spray maybe i need to tighten it up even more but when i look at the part that is part of the shower system the original is bigger enough to hold the spray in place without dropping it or causing it to turn around when the water is on it might work for you just fine and likely will make a difference depending on the place you attach the grip
my 85 yo mother has low vision and struggled with nail clippers these were perfect she still needs independence and these help in a small way
im sure this would work if i could stomach it the taste alone is so horrid i ended up mixing it with some other flavors to get it palatable which didnt work the thought of the taste makes me gag yes its that bad for metwo stars for not adding a bunch of crap but minus 3 stars because im going to throw it away since the taste makes me gag
will not cut a small pill without really having to hold it watch it and move it around
like kleenex better than puffs
color is a little faded transparent gold thin but okay quality
works perfect for my needs i have to take daily medication and it holds a bunch of pills and takes up so much less space then trying to carry around each bottle
with this mister you can change regular water into a hydrogenrich treatment in addition to hydration you get the benefits of preventing oxidation the device is small enough to fit in most bags and is ideal for travel its a good way to refresh your skin on the go or to keep it moist between skincare steps i highly recommend this productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
i do not like the boxes the tissues are in  who designs these things theyre terrible  but the tissues are the softest i have found therefore i purchase them yucky boxes and all
i cannot believe how just drinking a great tasting tea  which i love to do can have such a profound affect on my complexion well i can tell you that it does my skin is soft and glowing and to be honest i do use skin care products that are all natural or that dont have such rash chemicals in them and they do work great however after trying this tea my results have doubled even tripled in some areas like my glowing complexion and the softness of my skin im 53 and people have actually accused me of jokingly lying about my age most think im in my early fortys what thanks baetea for the opportunity to try this amazing tea i know some of you already knew the benefits of tea and i do to for health and overall wellbeing but for skin and complexion i had no idea
held up in wind ribbons that came with it too short wish they were a bit longer but fishing line worked
this got the job done but if you try to move it around under your desk with your feet it will collapse there are places where the metal stick not rod its not that sturdy are supposed to click into slots but the slots are too big so it doesnt stay in place when you move it this is way too cheap to cost nearly 100
this little thing is a great shaver and trimmer it does the job and its really compact which will be great for travel
amazing tool for every kitchen removes tea stains from cups with a single swipe with just plain water removes baked on grease cleans without marring surfaces and gets stubborn spots off frying pans when food sticks
meh its a weird applicator to use for makeup the way that is is cleanable is great for reducing the spread of bacteria but the way it applies your makeup is kind of odd and patchy and dry not sure if i would purchase it again

since our 5 month old daughter was born she has had sensitive skin and we are very cautious about the products we use with our previous 2 children we did not have this issue so we never bought dreft products before i purchased the newborn laundry soap for her clothes and noticed she was getting milk stains on her burp cloths and bibs without hesitation we purchased this stain remover since the laundry soap works so good and does not break her out this spray is amazing it will get anything out of clothes we stock this spray like its going out of style and i now use it on my 2 and 10 year olds cloths also the smell is good and its perfect for anyone with skin sensitivity or allergies we also use the dreft stain remover pens when we are on the go they fit perfectly in diaper bags purses etc definitely recommend this product to anyone with children or frequent stains as it is the best on the market now only if there was a fabric softener from dreft if there is i have yet to find it we would be 100 dreft users for now we will just use the free  clear from downy
i have purchased this product more than once because it works for me it brought my pressure down 10  15 points and now i am on just one medication rather than two i was able to get of my beta blocker this might not work for everyone and for 30 bucks its worth a try to see if it is right for you  note the tablets are quite large and might be difficult for some to swallow dose is 3 per day each bottle has 90 tablets  msrp is 3995
i love this stuff i put it in hot tea in the evenings i would and have recommended to friends
great torch lighter well constructed feels sturdy and fits perfectly in my hand  it is bigger than i expected which i like because it holds a lot of gas  easy push button lights every time

my go to morning tonicevery morning
size is weird for eyes  cant keep them on  they need to be secured in towel or something
if you need this for one burst for one party then this may be for youi bought two of these loved the look and the ease of use i bought them early and didnt need for a few months but did test them i took them to the first gig and they worked i only used them for two bursts no longer than 15sec each then nothing from one of them no more blowing the led lights still worked great and showed that i still had connectivity but the blowers diedafter the next try the second one also died i know what you may be thinking maybe it was bad power or a surge the power was fully tested and good the internal fuse was still in good shape and working finei contacted customer support and they told me to send a video of the issue and they would help so i did that no response i emailed again and they totally ignored it unfortunately amazon says that they cant do anything so much for the az guarantee hahaanyway i wish they would have worked great for me as the concept if good and the lights are great but i dont like the idea of paying 400 for each time i need confetti
love this tool it works great abs my feet look amazing and feel amazing i will be purchasing another one when this one is done
a nice change from all those orange flavored vitamin c gummies i kept thinking these were blueberry flavored but they are supposed to be grape  i think it could pass for either because the flavor isnt very strongi love that these are vegan and the cute little gummy bear shapes you are supposed to take 2 a day  ive been taking these everyday along with my regular multivitamins theres only 20mg of vitamin c in each serving but its an extra boost on the amount im already taking plus theres zinc 3mg and echinacea 10mg
gentle and effective my teeth have never been cleaner
not quite as high quality as i was hoping for but it works well  we will see how long it lasts may edit this review in a few months also had to trim out the opening for the charger to plug in it wasnt big enough for my charger cord to fully seat
these clippers didnt really do good for my shaggy yorkes hair they did fine using the main blade alone on the shorter groin hair when shaving so it would probably work for a short haired animal just not on shaggy yorkie hair so for me i would not buy them again
okay well its okay kind of short like its designed for short people  the first thing i am confused about and need to bring it up is the brand mines came with chinese writing all over it so im not sure about ywshf spin sweeper 3 in 1 this name is featured online  makes me feel like i was shipped a knock off brand also the color shows turquoise but i received a royal blue unitit works okay does not pick up anything big not sure about the peanut and shells they should this unit picking up possibly because what i received might be a knock off  but again its okay its a good thing it only cost 1299 oh but wait i could have gotten it off of ebay for cheaper with a few extra items
amazing leaves  great service  thank you will tell friends and buy again a
i love this straightener because its small  small enough i could throw it in my purse or laptop case and because it charges using my laptop i can use it anywhere  in the car in a hotel or in my office its the perfect travel solution it charges quickly holds a charge well and heats up in seconds perfect gift idea for the traveler in your life
doesnt stick to shoe
if you are looking for something to help with your sitting comfort this wondergel will help this is my second purchase i bought one for my wife and i very please with the purchase
my son has a varied healthy diet but as a toddler the majority of the new foods i give him end up on the floor or in the trash he particularly despises meat so i looked for an ironcontaining vitamin to make up the difference these vitamins taste pretty good ive tried them too and my son claims they taste like candy his most recent hemoglobin blood test revealed no low levels for him he also keeps growing quickly so it must be working
i will get one every year
i love these earplugs they are great for sleeping and for swimming best earplugs on the market right now
it came already opened which is gross i never listen to these types of reviews because of course this doesnt always happen and im the unlucky one but its very disappointing because i was really looking forward to using this
bought because i got covid my mom was telling me she was worried about my o2 dropping so i basically just got this to help ease her worries seemed to work well and my o2 stayed above 90 usually above 95 so that was good
the bath sponges came safely secured tightly sealed there was no air in the package the sponges are a decent size large enough for my sons body four came in a pack he is super happy to have these sponges
i liked it didnt disintegrate and food didnt stuck a bit thin though
these compression socks are super comfortable easy to get on and easy to get off the wide calf design makes these super comfortable for long term wearing to me they felt like i was wearing socks but still provided me with the supportcompression i need the price for this pair is still less than i paid for one compression sock from the drug store and isnt nowhere near as comfortable as these will purchase more even though i only need one compression sock
they would be more comfortable if they were the full length of the shoe
great to have on hand
gets everything out of my little ones nose my hubby even uses it
i was hoping this would be a handy multifunction trimmer and chose it because of the large assortment of attachments the trimmer works well with the preinstalled attachment and the blade is sharp enough for a relatively close shave without bloodshed however trying to remove it is impossible  according to the instructions you need to grasp the unprotected blade head with your finger to release it and then pull it out by the sides  whilst i was trying to position my hand so as not to engage the large power button that is literally the entire upper half of the shavers body i felt the blade bending on my third attempt and gave up also included in these kits was an empty usb power block casing in addition to some major design flaws where is the quality control
nice well made sleep masks  soft fabric light as a feather  comfortable too
i used this stuff for like 3 months and it did absolutely nothing like nothing at all i work out regularly and i was pretty sad about it
incredible buy very well made lights and alarm work perfectly im talking this on my russian river cruise
if i knew this replacement cover is this expensive i would ever put this item on my baby shower registry
dont waste your money just buy some apple cider vinegar it works much better
no pinching and curls easily
great size im always cold so i sit with this on the couch behind me to keep me warm my husband uses his for various other needs and we are both please with it the large size is great but the material is best we used to have to warm the old one up to just be able to manipulate and flatten it as it was the hard plastic material this one is more blanketlike great purchase and was fsa eligible so even better
when my doctor suggested stinging nettle root to help me breathe i decided to research and see the benefits and cons of the herb the more i researched the more the all natural supplements sounded like the right choice i looked at many different brands before deciding on these im satisfied that i got these the capsules arent too big to swallow and leave no nasty aftertaste with any kind of supplements youd expect to be able to smell the ingredients but these have no smell they start working within a few days of beginning them and within one week i was breathing better than i had in years they help to clear out sinuses and keep chest clear do breathing is easier these are a less expensive brand and are a great value for the money
we live in sunny and hot southwest florida having proper eye protection during the day is critical to your longterm eye health  not only that but my eyes have changed as ive aged and i need reading glasses to see anything up close  finding a way to keep both pairs of glasses close and handy became very important to me  after seeing a friend wear both pairs of glasses around his neck i realized that his method worked very wellsince you virtually have one or the other pair of eyeglasses on most of the time there just appears to be one pair hanging from your holders across your upper chest  need to put on your sunglasses when going outside  just switch from your reading glasses no more putting your eyeglass cases down and forgetting to take them with you  no more glasses falling out of your pockets and getting bent or broken when you or a friend steps on themi bought two different pairs to try out these holdie classic pu leather and a new pair of croakies premium leather  both are leather both have adjustable rubber clips to fasten to the bows of the eyeglasses and both can be adjusted to fit just about any type of eyeglass bow  these are both versatile because the design of the rubber clips allows you to fasten them to most types of eyeglass bows the type of holder that has hollow cloth or rubber ends lets the glasses slip out of the holders and fall off  plastic clips instead of rubber tend to break under stressthese holdies are a 34number one best seller34 on amazon with 191 reviews and a 43 star average rating  they are sold in a 3 pack for 1299 for an average cost of 433 per unit  each of the three units comes in a different color for matching your outfits black dark brown and light brown  nice touch that  my only concern is that the leather straps 2634 long are flat and made of raw leather  that can be a problem in hot climates as raw leather think leather watch bands can absorb sweat and begin smelling a bit funkyoverall though its nice to have three different colors and know that they are wellmade  they also have a bead in the center of the strap to allow you to tailor the length to whatever you are comfortable with  made in china but well executed
bought this oil to aid with bad yeast under the armpits and upon putting it on the itching and swelling were under control i will be buying this again
see disclaimer belowthis glucosamine chondroitin msm combination is great i wanted to try it because i have a lot of joint pain and am seeking a diagnosis for ehlers danlos a connective tissues disorder so im trying to find things that will support joint health and maybe help relieve a little of the back and knee pain i experience i know that this company has really highquality products and ive been very pleased with this one the gelatin capsules are so much easier to take than the big pills ive bought over the counter in the past and there is very little smell and no taste i have to take a lot of medicine already so that is a huge plus for me it also helps cartilage health immune system and hair skin and nails so it covers a lot which i appreciate less supplements to take is always better in my book i highly recommend this product especially for the joint health as i have begun to notice a difference in my knees particularly
and im no kid any more  ive tried traditional massagers  the electric ones and those manual roller kind and they dont work for me  i have very sensitive soles  one would think after 6 decades i would have some tough leather foot soles but no they are extremely tender and sensitive to just about everything  i do have a regular foot bath massager thats okay because i do put epsom salts in it and fill with very warm water and let it jiggle my feet for a while and i always have a big towel handy to dry off my feetthen i have to wrestle that full of water massager to the sink to dump it out clean it out and let it sit out to dry before storing itnice but a pain right  this foot steamer is still large like all foot massagers of any type are but what was nice is the small amount of water used so that didnt add weight to the unit that i had to deal with afterwards  big plus  the steaming i tried on medium firstas i said i have fairly tender sensitive soles and the medium steam was warm to my feet but not uncomfortable  id not tried a foot steamer before and was surprised at how it made not just my feet but me feel  relaxed and much more comfortable than i had been when i started  i just wish it could use essential oils or the special teas made for body steamers as i think that would be a boost to how my feet felt after using it but thats just a thoughtall in all i love this foot steamer
copaiba oil is a very important component in the care of a family member who has amongst other health problems a muscle cramping problem postcramp a little massage using coconut oil and a few drops of copaiba oil has proven to be the most effective way to ease sore muscles we have tried many overthecounter products but nothing beats copaiba oil and there are no contraindications with the prescription medsthere was a snafu in shipping but the seller made it more than right
very relaxing love there stuffalways the best supplements at the best price the real deal no sugar and fillers buy
puff and durable
this really really really works helps hide your smoking habit
ive taken prescription meclizine for vertigo for years and this rising health meclizine seems to work just as well it makes me a little sleepy just like the rx and gets rid of most of the spinning just like the rx i get it really bad sometimes so nothing gets rid of the spinning and nausea completely but id be in rough shape if i didnt keep this on hand this rising health meclizine works great and i would definitely recommend it
i like the fact that it has a decent amount of direct skin pain reliever which i use for the nearunbearable pain of damaged nerves from herpes zoster
lost my old one and ordered this one i wanted an electric corded one and thought they sent me the wrong one they sent me another one and then i realized duh that the first one was exactly what i wanted was told to keep the second one as a gift wowthis product works great i use it every night on my rough feet because i go barefoot all the time have used this brand for years and will continue to do so
ziploc bags are in my opinion the most reliable these bags are the same as the plain ones in the store but with a large green bay packers logo on one side you can see what is in the bag on the backside if you are a packers fan these will cheer you up the logo is easy to ignore if you dont care about football gallon size is perfect for so many things
so far so good  i have worn this for a few days and have felt an improvement in my left heel where previously i had much pain  i hope the improvement lasts
im very satisfied with these syringes the markings are clear and easy to read even for my old eyes the plunger works smoothly with no binding regardless if the fluid is watery or thick  they come in a box for easy storage and each one is individually sealedi use them for pet medications and for mixing diy flavorings solid value for the price especially if you can get it on a price dip highly recommend
the work well
this shaker bottle is perfect for my pre and bcaas i used to refill my shaker bottle in the gym and never felt good about using that chlorinated water  also very happy with the quality
i bought these for my business as a pure romance consultant i use this for my sample goody bags that i give out it includes a couple samples my business card and a couple pieces of candy i love the different colors they come in and they were just the right size to fit everything in perfectly they are very durable and the price is great i definitely recommend buying these
it arrived quickly and it works just as it should the display is big and bright so its easy to read
vile stuff  has the texture of liquid oatmeal
with so many plant saucers to choose from on amazon not sure why i selected these but they are the best saucers i have ever purchased  not a drop of water will ever get thru these things  nice think plastic  not like those flimsy ones you can purchase at the box stores that bend and are easily punctured  would definitely recommend
top came unglued
cant say it whitens well but it leaves me with fresh breath
10 little patches the size of 2 normal patches this product is a scam
total waste of time and money  the cats seem to be attracted to it
personally less sweet would be okay with me the flavor is very good and tastes fruity much like raspberries  this is actually a great product with all the other combined b vitamins added the bottle says 60 servings i am taking a half dropper a day because of all other vitamins i take every day  the bottle dropper works good and no leaks in cap rim as i shake it every time before using  still i think it is critical to get enough b12 especially for us older folks  this product also has a long expiration marked on the bottle this brand deserves high marks except for being a bit oversweet i still recommend it and feel it is a good value
and its about to expire
i purchased this for my elderly mother who has spinal stinosis she much prefers this pad over the typical chair or scouter pad this pad she takes everywhere she loves it
this product was amazing i took as instructed and my cardiologist said my cholesterol did lower while i cant say it was solely this product i have to say it had to have been part of the reason it was easy to take and there was no reaction to the supplement i am definitely keeping this in my daily routine
followed instructions to the note and didnt see results or feel any difference easy to follow instructions and packets though
i have purchased several hekunn wooden spoons in the past and love them all  this one is no exception  it is high quality and put any wooden spoons ive purchased at department stores to shame  i was able to participate in a promotional event and receive the spoon at a discounted price in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review  i gladly would have paid full price though because i love this companys products and i know they are worth the price  they are beautiful as well as functional  they are safe to use in non stick pans and also sturdy enough to use for stirring  before this spoon arrived their spatula had been my favorite product of theirs  this right up there with it  i spend a lot of time in the kitchen and appreciate any quality products that make my time in there easier and more enjoyable  products from hekunn definitely fit that bill  the products do take longer than some other products to arrive but they are worth the wait
they are very sturdy and precise
one day delivery installed by daughter well madeworks great
i wouldnt use the word softness to describe these they are great go exfoliating which is what they are designed for im very happy with this product
great tissues
this gloves are perfect for dish washing or other household cleaning duties they keep your hands protect nicely during all these duties we love so dearly not they are a good quality product that should stand up the test of time quite nicely only time will tell these gloves come with a cotton flocking that makes wearing them nice and comfortable and absorbs your sweat to some degree getting a pair of these for 10 is very good so i can recommend purchasing these for sure
this was a very brutal year in my area for pollen and allergies  on top of everything we did some renovations so there was dust and allergens absolutely everywhere for a while  we my husband and i went through a bunch of allergy medicines and nothing really worked  then we tried this on the advice of a friend  i was absolutely amazed  there was no fogginess no druggy feeling but our sinuses really opened up  quickly  im just amazed at how well this works  this product has earned a permanent place in my medicine cabinet
great quality hot water bottle love it
these are nice tweezers inexpensive too
i like this better than my miacleans great get the makeup off completely livens up your face
i felt a little mixed about this foot peel at first  nothing happened for about 4 days  no peeling  then after a shower on about the 4th day my feet started peeling like crazy for about 4 more days  in my ignorance i did this prior to an outing which required my bare feet to not look diseased so i scrubbed them like crazy w one of those cheese grater things even after that they were still peeling  i would just say use this with some caution  you do not want to use this right before a beach vacation  if you do it 2 to 3 weeks before you want your feet looking good then you should be fine
this is good and very moisturizing
loved it for my granddaughters 5th birthday party she loves mermaids and it was perfect
doesnt stay on falls constantly while using dangerous i only weigh 135 lbs and i cant rest my foot on it do not buy
working great
i travel a lot and dont always have access to food i like to carry these as they are convenient and tasty for a nutrition bar the other types tend to be too large and too sweet tasting for me this size is much better i can eat enough without getting tired of the taste and is just enough to satisfy my hunger until i can get a proper meal
this is the best value for rope style cotton for vaping using rebuildable atomizers on amazon
worthless product does not curl your lashes at all
i have used this product forever love it and will buy again
i like that these contain 10 billion cfu from 4 different strains and only one capsule per day is required  there are 14 capsules in a bottle so it will last just for two weeks making these probiotics kind of pricey at a little over one dollar per capsule  that said they didnt upset my stomach at all and i generally feel better when taking probiotics  they dont contain gluten dairy or soy
its impossible to give a valid review when i have only been taking a few days  it takes a while to determine if there are any positive or negative reactions in such a short while
i love this its the perfect size to fit over my scooter
helps the glasses while grocery shopping
i thought this was a great idea but it just ended up being a hassle the seat part of is just loose fabric i thought it looked like it had some stability on the sides in the photos but it doesnt it get incredibly heavy when wet so its not easy to hang as it feels like its going to break off the hook
this stuff really does keep your glasses on i use it daily its especially good for workouts and when i run outside i use it on my sunglass the only drawback is that the wax leaves a film if you get it on your lenses and youll need a towel to get it off
ashwagandha powder is a new supplement here and new supplements are interesting for determining health improvementa bit of research shows ancient homeopathic use in africa its kind of strange that its homeopathiccurative claims read like snake oil but what the heck there have been occasions that new supplements to me have been wildly effective  glucosamine msm  chondroitin being one from years ago  conversely after multiple trials of melatonin it reduces my immune systems ability to prevent coldsashwagandha powder is worth a trial given the supplement grass roots attention its gettingfirst it doesnt smell like horse it smells like garden soil to me and it smells like nothing to another nose it tastes like nothing ashwagandha powder does not effect the smoothie tastewell wait and see what happens
exactly what i was looking for i take a few different medicines and one i have to on occasion split into half to date i used a knife but that didnt usually work too well but since it was a once in a while thing i made it work i figured it was time and get a pill splitter this one is perfect small and easy to use and in my eyes cute it works well and you dont loose your pill halves after you are done either exactly what needed
i put in my morning drinks or smoothies
daughter loved was broken when received
my dog had surgery and since this is not the first i knew i would need packing material and bandages  this worked great
i purchased these toothbrush holders to add to shoeboxes for operation christmas child the holders are sturdy and much cheaper since i bought them in bulk
i tried this when i was on vacation in australia and loved the way it stuck  stayed put on an injured foot like nothing ever has before  it doesnt leave that sticky residue either
burns and only single or use twice before liquid solidifies  for the use  it didnt work as well as other name brands wont buy again
update 2522 i tried to give this blow dryer a shot on the highest wind setting at medium heat mind you it normally takes less than 10 minutes to dry my terribly fine thin hair it didnt even make it halfway through before it crapped out dead the plug didnt shut it off it just died with all of its shortcomings and now this its a definite no go2322 this eniseca 1875 watt negative ionic hair dryer is not as versatile as it is made out to be i was really looking forward to being able to change the temperature and wind settings to my liking i have fine thin hair and need a lower speed with hotter temperatures than most blow dryers have with this blow dryer its impossiblethe only time you can adjust the temperature is if its on the highest wind speed which is totally ridiculous if you lower the wind speed at all it goes to the coldest temperature which is even more ridiculous i do appreciate being able to change the temperature on the highest wind setting but i need a lower wind setting and a higher temperature setting than cold and i do mean coldafter deciphering the meaning behind this seemingly faulty setting they make it appear that a lower wind speed should only have low temperatures for childrens sake i didnt buy this blow dryer for a child i bought it for myself furthermore i would not want to blow dry my childs hair with cold airthis blow dryer could have been a super win all around but instead its a flop for me its fine if you only blow dry your hair on a mediumhigh speed at all times but for those of us who dont or cant do that its pretty much useless just to note the highest wind speed setting is not nearly high enough to please those with thick long hair but it  get extremely hot this is not my favorite
mixes very easy tastes great i mix it with almond milk  im going to make some popsicles and see how that works as a treat
these were great support for my daughter recovering from weakness and pain in her knees from runninggood product and prompt delivery
i get hives after eating some foods but these capsules take care of them quickly i wish the company offered larger quantity bottles
these come in two sizes in the container  neither one of them fit  they felt a little too stiff not suitable for me
good sturdy basket really holds up well i just went food shopping and help up like i couldnt believe itonly con is instructions are a little poor so i cant take it on off my scooter like its supposed tobut all in all glad i have it and not a closed up bag where i have to fumble to get things
my kid snacked his face with the lanyard and left a mark looking for less stretchy
this system can whiten your teeth it does it gradually follow all the directions and use only as instructed do not use more than recommended keep in mind that if you dont follow the directions you could cause sensitivity in your teeth gum irritation sore throat and uneven whitening
i dont taste it  add it to my smoothie daily  but i wouldnt mind the taste if i did taste it  i like mushrooms this is keeping my brain happy during this awful year 2020 i recommend it
made a good purchase
i had a geo matt from 15 years ago and lovedbut figured it was time to replace  these are good but not as good as the old ones  they will not last 15 years but if they make it 5 i will be happy  i love the way they feel  i was first informed of them by a hospital and am glad  the egg crate dont compare or the memory foam coverlove these
vibrations definitely exceeded my expectations for the smaller size i have another that is similar in size and appearance but its not as strongproduct itself seems to be pretty well made and has a nice sleek look to itand is comfortable to use buttons are easy to control and get toproduct packaging was also very well done it comes in a box with the brands logo and then in a black velvet bag for more permanent storagethe bonus plug that is included is flexible and soft but has a hard time staying in placeoverall i am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend would buy againitem was received at a reduced price im exchange for an unbiased and honest review  that in no way affected my opinion
these round pink ice packs are manufactured by the same company that manufactures the blue round ice packs i bought the blues ones about 3 months ago when i was suffering from my first attack of eyelid dermatitis the blue ones worked well they came in a travel handy plastic zippered case they did take about 24 hours to get fully icedi had a second attack of eyelid dermatitis this month and found that with the time required to ice i needed more than 5 round ice packs in a day so i ordered the cheaper pink packs because money is tighter this month they came first they are not in a travel handy plastic zippered case i will have to supply my own zip baggy second now that i have started to use them i am surprised because they seem to not stay icy as long as the blue ones why should color make a difference the substance inside seems less gel like too am i crazy imagining thisbetween my osteoarthritis knees yes the right one is acting up now too and what is turning out to be repetitive bouts of eyelid dermatitis i am getting to be a connoisseur of icing and ice packs so i dont think i am imagining this even if it seemingly makes no sense next time i order its is back to the blue ones and damn the higher cost the pink ones work they just work for a shorter timebtw using these round packs for my right knee too slip them between layers of my ace bandage wrap right over the medial point next to my patella that burns the point is higher up than the medial meniscus so i have screwed up something different on the right knee than left knee learning to watch how i move my knees very carefully to prevent all future injuries going to watch sumo wrestling for overweight knee movement pointers i am overweight but not sumo level oh lord thank you but between rx meds that make it hard and slow to lose weight and two medical conditions that make it hard and slow to lose weight i need the big sumo guys help in knee movements help me sumo guys how do you keep you knee joints in good shape
this is a great snack low carbs and full of protein just right when the munchies hit
hibiclens is a very thin liquid and this pump has a strong pumping action  the hibiclens tends to go everywhere and it disperses too large of an amount  not sure if i will continue to use this  i have found luck using a foaming dispenser with this  helps to keep it from getting everywhere
cons  adjusting screw is between the jaws and interferes with picking up large items like paper towel rolls  also very heavy for my wifepros  very sturdythe suction cups seem like a waste  better without them
negative ion necklace  interesting idea and figured id try it  so far it seems to make a difference  maybe not a huge difference yet but i have noticed that i am more awakealert  see im in my 60s and i often will feel tired and if i am sitting its very easy for me to close my eyes and fall asleep just that fast  with this necklace it seems to help me resist falling asleep like that  maybe there are other benefits but thats the one i have noticed
awesome is my first reaction i love it it is light weight and works great for my needs
it feels nice looks pretty affordable does it feel work i dont know
easy to put on and pulls you how you need to stand
i really like this holder it clicks on my keychain and my oils are always handy
comes conveniently boxed easily portable three adapters in one multi led lights brightens just like whitener from dentist office mouth piece is comfortable soft
you can go with a smaller one and spend half the day trying to irrigate your ear or you can get this big one and be done with it already nice and easy though dont bust an eardrum and rinse yer brains
great for meds and vitamins stay shut easy to refill
yes it is a very good product
i love this product i have alot of muscle pain in my shoulders and this has allowed me to relax would definitely recommend
i was very interested to try this supplement as i like to take most of what is in the pills for immunity especially during the stressful winter months  i did not realize that a bottle only lasts 10 days if taken as directedsizethe pill size is standard and not hard to swallowodorthe odor of the pills is not excessive or intensedigestive issuesi had no issues with burping upset stomach or other digestive problems when taking thishow i took thisi took this as two capsules a day when i was feeling a bit under the weatherdid it helpi did see that it helped me just by taking 2 capsules in a dayhow is this supposed to be takeni was shocked when i read the instructions to take six capsules a day which amounts to this bottle only lasting 10 days  that means at 20 a bottle at the time of this review that you would be paying 60 a month to take this supplement  i am not sure it is worth thatcountry of originthis says on the bottle that it is manufactured for a place in fl and formulated in the us but it does not say where it is actually made that i can find on the bottlethe bottom linealthough this helped me some at a lesser dose than recommended if taken as it says it is pretty expensive  i am not sure it is worth it to get 3 bottles a monthmy ratingthree stars  although it does work it is a bit high priced and the bottle contains so little compared to monthly recommendations i can not rate this higher than 3 stars
i love this it works well and smells nice i practice hot yoga so this cleaner is a must
i have fragile skin that tears with a normal bandaid even with being easy to remove sticks very well
great product and delivered as promised
nice productbut cover to batteries really tough to take off  lkb
this has a great combination of herbs and really makes one feel healthy
i really like these flashlight because its quit bright heavy and good design  i purchased eight and keep every room for emergency  also i usekeep rechargeable buttery for these so i can change and recharge them whenever i need it
work really well but wondering how long they will last
i used this to remove a mediumdeep scratch from a citizen ecodrive watch with a sapphire crystal i was not optimistic however after about three to four applications the scratch was nearly gone and the rest of the crystal looked markedly better watch the video before using as it is a little complicated and timeconsuming but well worth the somewhat expensive price and effort
i have previously reviewed this item from this or some other seller and am reviewing again in specific response to the very negative review by one person who seems to only have account to give negative reviews on this item  i am a real person with hundreds of amazon purchases and reviews  reading reviewer profile is important i thinkthis is my earlier review from item listing on another vendorthe only one ive tried that works well i have had three in the past the first split at the point of entry as i tended to push it a bit too hard causing compression at entrypoint local vendor advised the problem and next two did not have same point of failure they last about a year soft ur3 material warms up well and ribbed inside enhances the experiencea critical thing it is long enough so one does not lose lubrication out the end  messy and loses the charm of the experience it also accommodates larger users  it is 75 inches long where most others fail fastit will accommodate girth others just split out the end after couple uses there is some difference in the sensation from each end one being a bit tighter on the point of entryone description called it a pocket toy naaaa this thing is 75 inches by 25 inches and weighs about a pound walking around with this thing in the pocket would be noticedclean up is very easy with warm water and absolute minimal amount of soap be sure to rinse well as soap could cause some rash next time it is used the box includes a small pack of powder corn starch that they recommend using after each use or washing i never used it on previous ones and it lasted well enough i think the powder is to dry quickly to avoid bacteria and such i shake well after washing and store in a terry cloth with the flat end pointing downwards the end that has two holes putting this end up allows water to remain inside and you will see water next time if you store wrong end upit has a bit of a scented powder smell when you open the box it is from the scented corn starch i dont like the smell and would toss out the little package of scented powder and just use corn starch if i wanted to use powdernot easiest to find though i hope amazon keeps selling it even with one reviewer chasing after every vendor while having almost no other presence as a reviewer
i like the longer length and i like the snap closure  i would have prefered the old fashioned ties but i do not like velcro so i take whatever i can get  lol the bibs are not absorbent much at all  they do protect my clothing
so far it doesnt seem to live up to expectations supports libido not that i know what that means but nothings changed in that area boost energy and vitality no i even feel sleepier and ive had the same sleep pattern before and after taking this i dont get pimples often so i cant answer for that i will continue to use and see how it goes i take it with water every morning 4 drops on empty stomach as advised on the info attached to this bottle
we order these about every two months for our puppylove them and they stay on great
i have tried many diet supplements on the market most of them without results i decided to try this one and their 34carb and fat attack34 i also reviewed that one this supplement while i have not lost any weight yet it did stop my weight from climbing so i am going to assume that i am in a transition plateau phase i havent been exercising regularly so i am sure that is attributing to my stall  i started walking more regularly and eating better in conjunction with the other supplement vitamins and fruit smoothies im sure that with this product the weight will start to come offnow as for effectiveness i do notice a change in my energy i suffer from severe fatigue and i do find that i have more energy throughout the day when i take this i keep it down to a minimum because of the caffeine because i refuse to give up coffee and taking the full dosage with coffee does have me climbing the walls so i reduced the dosage to 1 mug of coffee in the morning and 1 capsule before lunch to keep my energy up this works for me i am sure it will take longer for me to see weight reduction results because i am taking a smaller dosage but i am sure that i need to be on this for more than a month to see the results and considering that i am having no ill side effects and everything seems to be okay i think i will stick with this for a while longer and post my results of weight loss if any at a later date for energy i highly recommend
it feels and looks wellmade but unfortunately it is too small i try to attach it to my hoover vacuum cleaner hose somewhere between 11634 and 18 too small leaving a gap
yoders is the very best apple cider vinegar i take it in the morning chase it with a beverage it truly helps with digestion shrinks the gut  keeps you all around healthier
very happy with this yoga mat spray it has a refreshing scent
like this company and the ease of ordering on amazon where we look for everything the meadowsweet was fresh and nicely cut i use it in my chicken coop as part of an herb blend that keeps the nest boxes fresh and free if the pests that like to jump on chickens
about half of them came damaged but the other half look great and apply easy
decent socks  although like many things the creators seemed to forget that big people are actually big  the size 13 fits the foot itself pretty good but the top of the socks get extremely tight on larger calves  i understand that tight is the goal but pain discoloration  numbness should not be  there really should be a bit more stretch to these especially with the prints  as is when taking them off i can clearly see the design of the sock imprinted into my skin  ive been compromising by folding the tops down  the whole experience is pretty great that way but i was kinda jazzed to have high top socks that didnt constantly remind me of every inch of my legs in  a bad way  oh well my quest continues
bottle arrived on june 2 but had an expiry date of april 2020
you are paying for the design but its great mat overall
this pack of reading glasses was a great buy the glasses were only a couple dollars more per pair than the ones i usually get at the dollar store but much more sturdy and wellmade i would recommend these without hesitation
is it strange that i like my weight information being sent to the internet  probablyi have had this scale for abotu a year and it has been great  the battery has lasted beyond the manufacturer 6 months and still going strongyour weight data goes to your fitbit account so it is great if you are using the fitbit  having a running log of your weight is a great tool for gaining insight into your habits and their effects on you  when you add in the food tracking step counts and sleep data the resulting trends you can find is definitely interesting and can be used to drive effective changeexample when i dont sleep well for an extended period usually because i stay up late and need to be up earlier than normal i see my weight rise that week  i mean we all know that there are certain trends that tend to occur but it is different when you have the evidence and can actually see how your habits impact your body
these foam earplugs are easy to use and they expand inside your ears  but i would never rely exclusively on these for really loud sounds like gun shots  i think they might be fine for car races probably not nascar  really loud or to wear to block out some sounds while trying to get to sleep  i have one in each ear right now fully expanded and i can easily hear sounds around me so i cant really tell if they would reduce loud sounds or not they seem to be made out the regular foamy material a lot of ear plugs are made out of and they come very well packaged and you get 3 pairs in one plastic box for a total of 12 pairs
done buying these they are average to poor at best  save your money  more garbage sold on amazon
this one dissolves easy in water compared to previous glucosamine that i had gotten from gnc i was sent a free sample of glucosamine and have been taking it for about a week now and notice a slight difference in my joints and muscles i have taken glucosamine previously and it does take some time to fully get the benefits so you have to be patient but you will see results over time i will be ordering more once i run out glucosamine is best taken with chondroitin
like the design of this card keeper
multitasking cleaning products can certainly help to make more room under the sync i like this product because its so versatile it has a nice citrus scent and its very effective on sinks and tubs cuts soap scumi decanted into a spray bottle cleans refrigerator fingerprints beautifullyi poured some in the toilet bowl much nicer than harsh chemicals
personally didnt like the smell
i have been suffering from anemia and decided to try and add some iron tablets to my regimen i like the fact that they have not upset my stomach or had any type of reflux with them
increased all my alkalines uses by 50150
love the size of these tiny bags  purchased to use in the garden i place the bag over seed pods to prevent the seeds from blowing away in the wind   i have a butterfly garden and plant milkweed the flowers develop into seed pods that burst when mature and the exposed silk fluff has a small seed attached at the end the fluff blows away in the wind to capture the seeds the organza bags keep them in the bag once they burst and i can place them away and collect the seeds to replant next year  really good purchase
camphor spirits the price and effectiveness of this product theres nothing i dont like about it
great tasting protein powder seems to be a quality product as well i added it to a blender with water and ice and it was a quick and satisfying protein smoothie filling and tastes great
smell great and are very thick
yes it does say mini but come on is extra mini for a high price i was not happy seeing that little box yes i know i should have read the size but not everyone does that every time and the pictures are misleading
i have never been big on vitamins with the exception of the occasional multivitamin however during the pandemic i started on a daily regimen of taking vitamin c vitamin d3 and zinc every morning and an additional vitamin c at night this is a large bottle of three hundred tablets enough to last me for three months i typically take all my vitamins on an empty stomach and i have had no ill side effects from doing so everyone should be taking these daily to strengthen your immune system even if you are vaccinated highly recommend
i bought the germguardian to deal with kitty litter smell the kitty litter box is in the spare bedrooms bathroom and i have not been able to control the odor until now i run the germguardian 24x7 and it eliminates the smell 100 the spare bedroom is now the best smelling room in my house im definitely getting a couple more of these guysi have been running it a little over a week so i cannot comment on the units reliability i have my fingers crossed it will last a while
these work great for their price they exfoliate a perfect amount not too soft not too rough they lather great they dont last too long but you get what you pay for  thats why im assuming they are 4 in a pack
natures benadryl with no side effects gotta love it it just works
i have plantar fasciitis and these do help some i should say i have a serious 7 year problem in both feet so it could be more helpful to someone with a lesser issue
deliciousi have to watch a sugar leverthis is just perfecti blend it with unsweetened milkit tastes like a milk shake witha flavor
it worked for me while cutting down hedges has a pleasant smell and is very creamy i love it
it only removed a little bit the newest dirt i did it several times followed instructions left it several hours and removed barely 20 mine was not even close as what they said and it looks pretty bad still the pink metal sponge braso did more in one scrub that this in 7 i threw away the rack and the rest this is not worth it at all a waste of 20
the sponge heads at the store have a hole in the middle they all leak like crazy these do not leak they last about a month i use them all the time so that my be why they only last a month but i love them and will be buying them again
super cute long sticks and they workgood value for 3 boxes
my husband wears them to bed every night
this has a very nice cherry almond scent  as soon as i opened the box i instantly recognized the scent  it didnt spill or anything and im not quite sure why the box smelled but its nice  i really like this brand  this is not my first lotion from them  this lotion absorbs instantly  my one pet peeve is putting lotion on and having greasy hands  i cant stand it and over the years have thrown out expensive lotions because of it  this absorbs into my skin instantly  im currently wearing a brace on my  knee and from all day wearing it my skin is extremely dry when i take it off and i put this on and no more dry skin  the pump is nice and works well  if you put this on right after a shower you will smell the cherry during the day especially if you sweat or get overheated  i really like this scent and of course really like this lotion  it reminds me very much of aveeno  for a long time aveeno was my lotion of choice  it didnt make my hands greasy and absorbs and it is a nice product but this one is just like it and for less  i really think this is a great lotion  if you dont like greasy hands or skin and like aveeno try this one
this package is a good value and will last a long time
quick ship i love this toothpaste but its hard to find sometimes keep in stock and i sure will buy
this mushroom supplement is probably one of least expensive ones i reviewed in a long time  as of this review it costs  1499  i like the wide variety of mushrooms included and am always glad to see chaga mushroom included though i dont know how much of it is in this supplement  i buy chaga separately as a powder because it is so incredibly good for the immune system  all of these mushrooms in this supplement are extremely good for health and there is nothing i can find negative to say about it
this is a very good product
very thick and heavy duty does not leak with a lot of liquid
never again totally ruined our mattress even though i added more elastic to the straps it is now very uneven and indented where the mat was placed constantly shocked me so much happier now that we took it off had it on for 2 yearsnever again
ive never tried argan oil before i always used the cheap crap oil from garnier or what not i put some on my wet hair and it didnt make it greasy at all my hair is super shiny and soft
ive ordered these towels before from another seller  same brand so it didnt occur to me that it wouldnt be the same towels  these are not  they have none of the genuine coarseness of the real towels  i thought i was getting a bargain because i was getting four towels  waste of money
this hatteker mens electric shaver is the perfect travel companion  compact and lightweight it will fit snugly in any carryon luggage or a weekend bag the accessories include a charger and a small cleaning brush the circular design is really cool and functional for travel i probably wouldnt use it for everyday home use mostly because its small size would get lost on my sink counter but it provides a crisp shave with low noise its a fun travel buddy to have around
these reliable 1 laboratories crumble in your mouth before you can get a glass of water to your lips  it took 3 swallows to get the grit washed down  i detect no taste at all which helps but i wonder if there is actually any omeprazole in them
returned it  there was practically no fragrance at all the automatic spray is great not the wax
these elderberry gummies are very near the top of my list of favorite elderberry gummies  these taste very good but my main reason for liking them so much is that they include propolis echinacea and vitamin c  these dont have any zinc and im glad of that because it seems like zinc is included in so many other supplements  these gummies have about twice the amount of elderberry of many other gummies that ive reviewed and ive learned from experience what an incredible antiviral elderberry is  i havent got sick at all this cold and flu season
i broke the first aromyst i had by dropping it i liked it so much i purchased another one instead of a different brand i like the looks of the black diffuser as well as the options of a continuous mist or an onoff mist i use it every other day or so
not what i was hoping for if information on ormus is correct then an electromagnetically sealed container is needed but not included it is hard to tell if there is anything other than water in this mix but when i looked at it under a microscope i did see little bits of yellow that i assume were the gold content if that is correct then the gold has recrystalized into a metal and would not have the same effect as intended wish i had spent my money on vitamins or something that would have a definite effect
this is my second time ordering first time taking this vitamin it was suggested to me by a herbalist that i am working with i appreciate that it is plant based i take one each night before bed the benefits were noticed almost immediately  my body got used to it and my days are very balanced now thank you
great mat to help protect surfaces from heat damage i usually set my curling iron to around 400 degrees and the mat shows no signs of damage what so ever i should have bought one of these years ago its flexible so it can be rolled up and stored away until you need it
great buy for vaping use i have used it for over a year now with no complaints
i have super thick hair and a lot of it everytime i curl my hair my arm gets a workout sitting there for minutes just to make sure my hair curls ive never had a wand successfully work until this one i recently got the cool girl haircut medium lob and this wand is an essential it smooths my hair as well no frizz and lasting waves very happy customer
this is a nice pill box very pretty but i dont like that the containers are not attached to each other
uses all product instead of absorbing it it does take more patience and blending but i love it i dont feel dirty after using it
only cotton swabs i can use due to cauliflower ear and they work very well
package was a little beat but colognes were intact
this is a nicefeeling smooth nonsmelly lotion that does well on my 34yearold skin  its certainly not foundation but it could stand in for a bb cream  it doesnt appear that it would be waterproof  and in fact in a deep sweat it starts to run slightly but i have this problem with many such creams  overall id recommend  as a reference i would consider myself mediumfair and the light is sufficient
these are great i got 160 wipes two years ago and just now need more and oh no the company that makes them is no more ill try kimwipes but oh my heart i never knew i could love disposable microfiber wipes so much they were phenomenal for cleaning my glasses
the silicone is too slippery to hold soap if you get the soap on your back the silicones too soft to exfoliate or even reward you with a back scratch what you get is more like whipping and popping a dead octopus on your backits noisy  you can hear it in the bedroom for gosh sakes
love this product it really works
they are smaller than expected i had to attach the two together to go around my leg doesnt seem to be  a lot  of compression
all as expected
my sister uses this to cushion her toes on her injured foot  she says this works very well  i imagine it could be used for a lot of things
bought these for blessings bags they were perfect
this was a really good deal  i actually ended up with a couple types of dishwasher soaps small bags of them stain remover gain laundry soap gain scent booster type product full size and some more  that was well worth the money  plus i got the full purchase price back in credit to use on other cleaning products which i took full advantage of  i highly recommend this box
is a zero rating possible this egg is horrible first off it sounds like a smoke detected siren second it is jerry rigged inside and hot glued together good luck hiding something inside it and it being food safe also my visually impaired daughter is down right scared by this egg will not recommend and would recommend the talking egg or chirping eggs from other sellers on amazon instead and the price is outrageous
i like these face mask lanyards they are perfect to attach your face masks to you attach one end to each side of your face masks then when you dont use your face mask like for example if you are taking a break to eat or you are at a restaurant you can then take it down and just hang it around your neck using this lanyard no more leaving it on the desk putting it over your thigh or anything like that so much easier and better especially when you are out for dinner i always struggle on what to do with it and this is the solution or when you are driving in your car and you just need to put it away for a bit this is the solution these can also be used as ear extenders  ear savers meaning  the face mask is attached to the lanyard and around the head relieving the pressure on the earsi like it because it makes it easy to put the face mask safely away but close by and you dont have to put them down anywhere but instead they hang around your neck in this pack you get 4 of them for just 16 these are definitely some of the more expensive ones out there and not sure why they are more expensive because of the design  i always keep some around since it is easy to misplace them and i just keep them on the various cloth masks i have in the car and so on so having a few of the on hand is very handy
good price focus is better i like it
all empty capsules are not equal  these are far superior to other ones that ive had as these close perfectly every time coming out of a 100 capsule filling machine  ive yet to have one fall apart and dump powder everywhere as i have had with other capsules
returning this order i didnt see anything good in this product repeller i doesnt repel anything insects are still coming in
first of all i love the presentation of these this would be a perfect gift just as is the scents are all pretty nice and i appreciate that they arent overly scented once dissolved in the bath my bath water ended up quite vibrant but i didnt experience any tub staining im looking forward to using the rest of these
unlike the plastic tubs this canister looks good on the counter yes that matters to me of course what matters most is whats insidein addition to type 1 and 3 collagen there is whey and instant whole milk powder which helps boost the protein to a nice 20 gthe chocolate tastes high quality but then its ruined by too much monk fruit extract as a sweetener at least for me i know a lot of people will appreciate the sweetness because this is a product you can mix in just water as an aside personally id rather not have the oft used stevia either if they insist on it being sweet a bit of organic sugar would make it taste more natural and i wouldnt mind the extra calories it makes a very nice hot cocoa type of beverage even in water it tastes creamyanother thing i like is that there is no plastic scoop hiding under the powder thumbs up for friendlier packagingsomething else to like is the bottom of the canister which has both the date of manufacturer as well as expiration date that kind of transparency is greatly appreciated it instills trust
good to have for topical minor cuts
tears easily  if you wash your floss to reuse you wont like this
ive had this table a couple of years cons it has a permanent 34lean downward34 towards the center of the bed also one of the legs kept sliding down the button kept slipping instead of staying in the hole causing that side of the table to cave and everything would fall off my husband drilled a hole and screwed that leg permanently at the level of the other leg if the manufacturer wanted to improve on the design they could insert corner supports under the table top where it meets the legs that could prevent the 34sag34 or lean downwards towards the center of the bed the other way it could be permanently improved would be to create the tabletoleg at about a 50 to 55 degree setting instead of the 45 degree which causes the sag even placing diagonal metal supports from the legs to the table would keep the table up and horizontal to the bed pros its very easy to slide out and replace when you need to change sheets the table top also has a 34lip34 all the way around that helps keep items from sliding off the table its lightweight easy to clean doesnt rust we live on an island and you can place it closer to you or farther down the bed wherever you want it without any trouble at all if you do spill anything remember the lean you have more time to mop it up because of the lip around the top
nothing is listed on this product that it comes from china till you make your purchase this is a china product i believe amazon has the responsibility to let the buyers know why here products are coming from
love this set great art work and same amazing clipper
the reishi really seems to give me a boost in energy it is somewhat bitter however 14 teaspoon in a cup of coffee and it really isnt that bad i feel i am getting use to the bitterness given the research i am willing to put up with the bitterness for the health benefits
i do like these clippers wish they had one of those little metal bits to scrape under the nails also the catcher part works great but slides around a lot depending on how you hold the clippers which is a big flaw cuts well though good medium size which i like
was glad to see these arrivethese are made well and will be quite usefulthe 510 threading goes way down through the center  i cant imagine any rda rta or anything else with a 510 connector being too long to screw down into these threads and bottom out before it meets the base  nicely donethe base does not come with any kind of antislip material stuck to the bottom but it is machined out so you can attach one if you are so inclined  i will measure this machined inset and look around for something close that fits with an adhesive backing but even without it it will be very useful for building on or storing an atty while something else gets some mod timethank you for making these  they are priced reasonably enough that it will save me the timetrouble of making some myself  these address a very practical need for any vaper that has a topper with a 510 connection  especially if its a rebuildabledefinitely recommend
this flavor is great and it mixes up really well if you are sick of too sweet protein supplements this one is a great option
free product given for evaluation  review this is a nice 4 ounce amber glass bottle of pure moroccan rosewater  the amber glass bottle keeps the contents from going rancid as quickly  rosewater is excellent for toning and refreshing the face as well as for me various household projects such as soaps and sucha few reasons i took this review from a five to a four  the smell  compared to another usda organic rosewater i have the other brand is more light and refreshing  smell for smell i like the other one better  on the skin this spray actually feels a little heavy  it makes me skin super soft which is great but it leads me to believe these is oil in it somehow but what do i know  my other rosewater as well as rosewaters in the past have been light like water and delicate in consistencythis seems to be a nice brand and i truly enjoy using it but when compared to a like product which i love this one falls slightly behind it
this is the correct battery for my waterpik sr 3000 electric toothbrush so when it died i assumed that replacing the battery was the smart move  ive been soldering small electronics since 1968 and i correctly soldered the leads from the device to these very small tabs much smaller than picture would suggest  i put the toothbrush on its charging stand and its flashing lights indicated it was charging  24 hours later the button on the device was still nonresponsive  battery replacement is not a sure thing
along with elbow grease they polish off the nasty residue on cookware and kill soap scum in the shower including the once impossible bumpy ridges on the floor of our fiberglass bathtub these also work great to remove the sticky palm marks on the banister that seemed endless and almost impossible to get off nothing is impossible with these dynamos they wear through quickly when you really need to scrub but they are still the best thing i have found to do almost any task thankful
there are many reasons i like these plugs theyre discreet comes with me everywhere i go and they work when i put these on correctly it diminishes ambient noise while articulating speech i bought them after a hearing injury and i wish i had these then for the price its a great investment the only downside has been knowing when theyre on correctly without jamming them into my ear i have used them a few times and am now getting the hang of them when im done i try to clean them with soap and water dry them off and put them back into the canisterto you informed shopper if you dont end up buying downbeats please buy a decent pair of earplugs today if you dont have one you never know when that next event bar club lounge party or concert will leave you with irreversible damage
this came right away so no problems with the seller i take lots of vitamins but fear glaucoma since its in the family along with diabetes the vision health supplement is a great way to prevent problems as well as to keep the ones that are present from getting worse i got it free as a reviewer and intend to use all of it it seems as though its beneficial so ill likely be buying it when the free supply is gone
these dont weigh a ton and take up a lot of spaceat first i thought that the fragrance would be too strong but it was just light enough to where it didnt irritate my noseso easy as easy as a dryer sheetcleans welli had a conversation with a person in the waste management and recycling field once and it was pretty shockingi was under the impression that when you correctly place plastics to be recycled they arenot so he said that cardboard is but only a fraction of the plastics in recycle facilities go to the next stepno big plastic bottle for laundry is fantastic
dont fit my glasses
it is very cute idea however when i received it some of the letters were coming off also some of the letters are straight and some are crooked which drives my perfectionist brain wild i think i will be able to fix them but obviously i would prefer not to fix something i bought
nice small tablet that is easy to swallow no nasty aftertaste very good addition to vitamin regimen i have purchased these various times and will purchase again in the future
spring cleaning major cleaning this will hold up to 2 of the of other one personally a better deal still not sure it will handle the mold too well but there are cleaners for that lol im impressed ive given some to neighbors
zip lock works well  will buy more
works well enough i bought it so i wont annoy my wife when i vape in her car wife not annoyed daddy very happy winning
i like several things about these they have the most beautiful natural smells and just a couple drops in my diffuser awesome
the blue color is darker than pictured but it will work nicely for my glasses seems to be well made
its a great invention and i hope it lasts
these pain relief patches really do heat up almost to the point of pain you can stick them anywhere but i use them on my pelvis area when i am menstruating they do help with the cramping but are painful to peel off
these are almost a buffing file not a fine sanding file they work well as buffing but not so much for shaping
not as tough or as strong as the original as seen on tv product goes flat faster good price the originals last forever these will last a while they still help with plantar fasciitis will opt for originals from now on if you find the originals have too much height for you then these would be a great alternative option seems to be a different type of filler material for pad i would give originals 5 stars plus these i would give a 4
the medium worked for my smallish mans arm  good quality and it should last  use it before you need it for best results
i bought this for my boyfriend as part of beard grooming kit i put together for christmas he absolutely loves it he uses it every day with the beard balm i bought and his beard is so soft now a major improvement he loves the way it feels and brushes his beard when were watching tv he finds it very relaxing
the scrubby side is so soft my cats love this all over their tender faces and necks  esp my older cat
first time use with this product gave my mouth a fresh clean feeling the mint flavor is mild and pleasing i felt no burning in my mouth or lips  the gel is thick and i had to press the tube harder than normal but after about a 2 minute brushing and then rinsing out with just water my teeth felt clean and bright  i like that it doesnt leave a gritty feeling after brushing and it did brighten my teeth color  my opinion is the product was a good experience and i certainly recommend it
great 6 packgets 5
very high quality product though i cant say the same for the pump mechanism which broke at the top after the first use it was still functionaljust a bit less sothe lotion is emollient and rich without being oily the scent is redolent of apples and it doesnt linger after the first few minutes
these are a lightweight sock for summer do not bind at top and are nice looking ribbed socks they stretch very well so they are good for people with edema or sensitive skin issues my dads caregivers asked me to order more of these great socks for him  and i have tried several other kindsbrandsmaterials
very practical for cleaning between your toes it does the job well  i hope they make a longer handle someday  i bought three  recommended
very quiet and yet very efficient buy one you wont be disappointed
i really love these towels there are 50 cloths per roll for a total of 150 cloths over the three rolls the exterior design is festive starting the roll is difficult because the first piece is glued on real tight however once i got the first piece off i was good to go i was able to wash the counter with these or clean parts of my cats litter pans they are strong and reusable i do feel the current price of 1799 1999 minus 10 off is expensive however if these rolls last long and i can reuse more than several times then it might be worth it because at the current discounted price it comes to 12 cents per sheet only time will tell how long this will lastthis would have gotten 5 stars if they were not so pricey however this might not be 5 stars for everyone since it is a papertowel like cloth when it is wrung out it is hard to unravel i found myself picking apart the squeezed out cloth
i used this to clean and massage my face  it works wonderfully  i would recommend iter
this is the best ever no lies to any caps to used amen
i have used this product for a little over a year at first i really liked them however i started to have an ever increasing sense of doom and shortness of breath i had pretty severe anxiety for about 3 months one day about 3 weeks ago i ran out of these vitamins i just didnt start a new bottle my anxiety slowly reduced and is now all but gone i havent changed anything else so it had to be the vitamins
great product i needed it for halloween and definitely didnt need this much but for the price id buy it again
this is a nice scent reasonably priced as far as its attraction powers men are nice when i wear it and i am often told i smell nice so its a good value and i like it fine
these worked perfectly for my wall oplants the three designs are a cute addition but not visible when theres a plant inside the ring im using them indoors so i cant say what their durability is outdoors pretty easy to install and the rings are solid however there were a couple of rings where the hinges were a little wobbly but it doesnt take affect the sturdiness of the holders did not use the supplied wall anchors as they werent that great i had extra drywall anchors from other home projects that i used instead and i highly recommend you do the same seriously the anchors they provided are useless unless you plan on hanging faux plants that weigh next to nothing
product is as described and come with clear instructions on the back side of the packet  this product is for one application and must be used as soon as it is opened
yep its not the broom itself or even sweeping i hate its the dust pan  i absolutely hate trying to wield a broom while bending over to attempt to get the debris into the dust pan  and it never fails i have to continuously move the dust pan to get whatever ended up going underneath it  this dustpan is awesome  its on a long pole well actually 2 short poles screwed together has a large capacity so it holds more debris and actually makes it to the garbage without a lot of it ending up on the floor before you get there  very happy with this product
bought this for my dad he says it easy to use
glad i could get tissues in a timely manor
this tea is very yummy i dont know if it has actually helped my ibs but it tastes good the one complaint i have is it smells faintly of marijuanna i dont know if that is normal because this was my first organic loose peppermint tea despite the strange smell it is definitly worth it
this was ordered as a replacement for ours that had cracked it fit perfectly and works perfectly
previously purchased
apparently there is no return option for probably tastes like whatever my dog tried to roll in this is unfortunate because im pretty sure this stuff tastes like  feet a something equally nasty whatever it is its not the mint flavor i ordered nor the citrusmint flavor i received awful stuff wish i could return it
selling carrier oil with maybe a drop or two of the named oil i purchased a three bottle set in a department store does not have any aroma whatsoever
when i clicked on this listing i assumed automatically that these bottles were glass they look like and shine like the many other dark amber glass bottles i have in my cabinet and are not listed anywhere otherwise in fact i understood the 344 pound34 shipping weight as a confirmation that they were glass this package was not even half a poundi am unsure of what type of plastic this is as there is literally no labeling or info about product other than how to mix colloidal silver i do not feel comfortable letting my daughter inhale out of the nasal sprayer in a plastic bottle bpa or non bpa plastic is not safe at all let alone storing silver in it youd think when dealing with those who use colloidal silver they are already researching they are looking for real products that work and are mindful of chemicals plastic is a no brainer on my list of do not buysi wish the seller would have provided a more in depth description that goes further then the 34 2 sprayers and 1 dropper for all your asap silver sol needs34 that was providedthese will just be thrown awaythe shipping was way too long they charge a restocking fee for returned non damaged items and for 8 dollars total im ok with just throwing them away though i wish i knew sooner so i wouldnt have wasted so much timeill just go buy an overpriced glass bottle set at whole foodsvery unhappy with this purchase
wore them out already they were super comfy
they are okay but i need more of an arch support
no flavor easy to use and store easy to digesthonestly i feel stronger belly flathopefully this is a great long time but
this is a great quality nano geocache with a strong magnet the two geocache rainproof paper log rolls with metal roll ups in the middle are an additional great value
i didnt feel difference using these and for the cost i dont recommend
i really like this product i find the most apparent benefit i get is the added boost in energy my hair has felt nicer since i starting taking this as well greg customer service from their company has been a delight would recommend
bought this for my family they like it and it is used regularly
these are wellmade however they did not work for my problem of heel spurs  well i gave them 3 stars but changed it to 4 because they are better than i thought at firstneed to use them with boots like keens or some other bootnot sneakers or tennis shoes and not wear thick socks because these take up room in your boot  i always buy my boots a half size bigger than i wear because i put inserts in them  i have been using another inserts but i developed heel spurs so i tried other inserts out  at first i thought these would not work for me but low and behold once i placed them in boots with thinner socks i have had nothing but foot joy and knee joy and hip joy while walking  i would have given them a 5 star but they squeak a bithoping that goes away as they wear in  recommended
my husband has pollen sensitivity  we put this on his side of the bed and he can definitely tell the difference in the air quality
excellent very nice and smells okay and i love it
adequate for a product made in china 13 life expectancy of original cane tips made in usa
they work wonderfully while i workout at the gym
this is a great product for pain you do have to take it as directed by your practitioner it is a safe product since you are taking fruit enzymes
i think these balloons are pretty good quality  mine didnt have any holes like some other reviewers balloons did  you only get one number per package of balloons so if you need two of the same number youll have to order two packages  i used a mattress inflater to fill them but only used air  no helium though i think they would look great floating  they seem to hold air for a long time and the pink color is very pretty
bought this for the bathroom that houses the cat litter box works awesome and we dont even notice the smell of the litter box
if mixed in pitcher of liquid the taste is masked  if put in a small amount of water it tastes a little harsh  i take it before bed and believe my sleep is enhanced
but for what they are these have packaging that is quite different than what im used to  i mean most tissues are short squat rectangular boxes or more square upright boxes  of course there are the little disposable ones that women like me carry in their purses but ive not had any that are in a tube before  i love that i can store one in the car by using a drink holder  so much easier than rooting in my purse for a tissue when i feel a sneeze coming on  the packaging itself is pretty me being a girlygirl kind of person i do appreciate the colors and plants on it  the tissues themselves are sturdy and soft enough that i feel confident that even when reaching for one to contain one of my big sneezes that i do have more often than i would like i dont worry that the tissue might suffer a crack in keeping my explosive sneeze contained  the only thing i noted here is that the cost is a bit high but for a tube of tissues that fits well in the car it is worth the price at least to me
i love this mustard and it is so good all of them  they are well worth the money and you wont be disappointed until the jar is gone and then you will be soooo sad
i was not compensated in any way for the review of this product i suffer from joint damage in both knees therefore i need a rise in my toilet seat so i can easily get up and down guests to my home that do not have bad knees also state how much they like having the extra boost on the toilet i had a different brand of toilet seat booster prior to this that had a much more comfortable seating portionit was wider and was made of a better feeling plastic however after about two years of use the locking mechanism on that seat failed this new seat is made of a  harder plastic that is not as comfortable and the width is not as generous  however the side screw is on the backside rather than the front side and the seat is much more secure there is no wobble once that seat is fully screwed in the screws are very easy to adjust with large wing nut typed screws that are also me made of plastic that being said i do believe it will give me a good two years of use i would recommend this product one star deducted for for the narrowness of the seat
i dont know why i keep selecting these weird powders when they appear on my list of items i can review i really cant tell if they have any positive or negative effects on me after consuming i assume they are healthy in some way so i dutifully add a spoonful or two to of them to my daily smoothies i cant even detect that the ayuforest karela powder is in my smoothie because it blends in smoothly with everything else and i cant taste it you dont get very much of it though and the package is small  i guess if you are interested in karela powder you already know why you want it ill just tell you it tastes fine and mixes well
incorrect heading info i could not find a place to click to tell amazon these are totally for the polar opposite condition and are for a high arch foot and not flat footno arch which is awful infofrom aetrex own website for this model insert mens casual comfort medhigh arch orthoticsku  l600m and the l2420m is for flat feet which my mom got for my son
these scrubbers are great for all your dish washing needs  the sponge scrubber combo is perfect for most hand washed dishes  really gets the baked on food loosened and removed  the sponge side works great for more delicate jobs  if you have really baked on stubborn dishes the steel scrubber makes quick easy work of the mess  so far these have held up really well
it is just as advertised and easy to use  the only con is the zipper protector metal is brass and makes your fingers have that brass smell although it is a good reminder to wash your hands  perfect for keeping children out of medicines although it could be cut with scissors by a determined person  the zipper tab is of good size for all travel sized locks but i dont believe a school locker type lock would fit the vinyl material is thicker than i expected and over all i would buy this again if i had a need
this works i did find it stretched my pants as it said it would it doesnt claim to permanently stretch anything so it does exactly what it says it does loosen your pants for a good days wear if you wash your pants they are going to shrink back i would say my issue with use is being flat lazy i forget to set it up so i am back to grumbling best bet buy new pants
good size and sturdy
these were not cut out took us a long time looks so home madepoor quality
this is better than the clip that came with my case but it annoys me that it bends the clip when i clip it on anything that is not thin i try to connect it to my thin belt but sometimes i clip it to my pocket or pants and it does this if it was stronger metal is may not do this
this is a lovely small pendant that is very well donethe detailing is clear and the bale is large enough to accommodate most average chainsits very comfortable to wear you hardly know its there and have to keep checking to make sure it is still thereon religious jewelry i personally prefer a solid back this has a hollowed out back but the pendant has been finished off well and is quite attractive
total waste of money  does not work at all
very soft and comfortable socks
the directions were confusing the heating pad didnt heat and there no instructions on where to put it even if it did work garbage
im allergic to it the smell irritates me
great to have this box
i got this for my husbands lower back pain  when i first put it on his back all was well  a few minutes later he was fanning his back saying it felt like lava  we washed some of it off because he couldnt take it and he said it felt better  im not sure if i applied too much but i used a very little amount to start with  less than a pea sized amount  after the inital lava stage he said it did cool and seem to numb his lower back area and was soothing but that the initial skin melting stage wasnt worth the cooling after wards  if you dont mind extreme heat this would probably work for you  weve used sombracream and icey hot extra strength with no problem but those are nothing in comparison to this  we received this product for a discount in exchange of an honest review  my opinions are my own
if arthritis runs in your family you definitely want to get a jump on it before your joints start deteriorating this supplement is excellent for joint support it contains highpotency antiinflammatory ingredients you wont feel a difference immediately so give it time to work i highly recommend this supplementthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
exactly what i expected
i suffer from anxiety  just took one of these capsules and  im feeling so relaxed  i recommend
there arent many in a package so they seem expensive or i might get them again they taste quite good hardly different from almonds but smaller and maybe a light woody edge to them as i got the sweet ones it really wouldnt be possible to eat so many that they became toxic but the package is so small probably couldnt eat too many of the bitter ones either which seriously can be toxic and can even kill people the notion that they have health benefits beyond those of the almond are absurd though  that theyre sold even to cure cancer proves only theres a sucker born every minute health canada warns that cyanide poisoning is a real threat and health benefits not the least likely but the sweet ones have far too little of the chemical that breaks down into cyanide and the liver can clean that up in a jiffy
sharp and easy to use
this thing is horrible the bottom surface is very hard and lumpy its like walking in the driveway and stepping on rocks yuck it has hard plastic rollers that feel awful  i took them off but there is  hard plastic posts left bad design
this definitely works its very strong so do as the instructions say and take it with a good meal when i take on an empty stomach or with a snack it makes me feel nauseous
took first one felt good after a week started getting super dry skin and thyroid actually swelled up the only one seems to work for me was vitastrengthi tried this because of the great reviews since back on vita thyroid not swollen and dry skinweight getting better i cant recommend this in good faith
i experienced a noticeable improvement in memory recall
the fitbit aria has all the bells and whistles of a modern scale but it does its basic job of correct and consistent weight readings poorly if you stand on the scale thrice in row rest assured you will have a different weight and body fat reading each time who cares that those readings then sync up over wifi with your account
everything was fine
there is one very large and super soft mask in this package along with one small cloth carry pouch this mask is wellmade and has a velcro adjustment in the back since the mask is large it blocks out all light however i am still able to open my eyes underneath the mask and not see anything this is just wonderful and is very comfortable to wear the quality is excellent and the mask is plush and cuddly softthe current price of 1259 1399 minus 10 is pricey for one mask however if one is in the market for two of them they are sold for a much cheaper price  also the blue color on the amazon site is brighter than the one received which is more of a subdued blue
very good product  tastes great
these make my mouthteeth feel like i just left the dentist no pain dont need to do cartwheels floss the cleaning is thorough and the price is right for 4 in the packagei highly recommend as matter of fact im back to get a couple more packs
pretty soft and the price is good but you can still find cheaper alternatives from costco or other stores
nice massager sometimes it does randomly shut off but it does get used a lot
i really like the soft cloth at the head of the brush no scratching anything i use it on good sizes seem like they will hold up well recommend
i used to have full blown type 2 diabetes before i started changing my diet and lifestyle and fish oil has been one of the supplements that i incorporated in my daily regimen i have taken a lot of brands of fish oil supplements and the one from gloreyfeel is one of my all time favorite brands it has high concentrations of omega per pill and it doesnt have that overpowering fishy taste when i take itfish oil is beneficial to people who are suffering from various heart diseases high cholesterol depression anxiety ahdh weakened immune system cancer diabetes inflammation arthritis to name a few  so start taking better care of yourself and incorporate this supplement in your dieti received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes regardless i only recommend products or services i use personally and believe will be good for others i refuse to review or endorse products that i have not or will not personally try needless to say i may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things i say on my reviews are made up or fake  they are all based on my experiences with whatever product i am reviewing im just a regular consumer and i appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying my views and opinions are from a customerend users standpoint

this is a great starter kit for someone new to wicca  i only wish it came with a book rather than a booklet with print way too small for me to read  now i just need to find a good book with large print about beginner wicca
wash many times to get black coloring out also socks waay too small
im hoping for the benefits claimed time will tell  i have used in several dishes and as far as i know no one has exclaimed over the taste  i am careful in amounts added and cautiously optimistic about results
for a gift
my kids wear school uniforms khakis and polos and they come home every day with oily black marks all over their clothes from the recycled tire pieces used as a base on their playground additionally they have the normal kid stains food paint dirt etc ive never used a stain remover before but figured that would be cheaper than continuing to throw away clothesthis arrived in the mail yesterday and as luck would have it haha my daughter came home in khakis completely covered in black marks so i got to test it right away i followed the directions on the back of the bottle and treated the entire weeks worth of uniform clothes so some stains had had a chance to set in after one round through the washer about 90 of the stains were gone i did a second treatment on a few spots and rewashed everything and those khakis i would have otherwise thrown out were completely stainfree when i removed them from the washer there was also a white shirt from earlier in the week that had gotten paint on it in art class and that came out completely too the only stains that didnt come out were a spot that looked like it may have been from a sharpie and a grass stain honestly though these could have already gone through the laundry once before and set in so i cant say for sure that this wouldnt have worked on themi didnt notice this anywhere in the description but this product does have a slight smell kind of like baby powder also it leaves a soapy residue on anything you spray it on and clothes required extra rinses to come cleanoverall im amazed at how this took really tough stains out of clothes and i am so glad to have found something that will save us from having to constantly replace clothing because i went through about twothirds of a bottle on a single load i think ill be buying this at target from now on since their website has it much cheaper
can be used normally
my husband really likes these vitamins for what they contain as he is an avid runner and weight lifter
this brush is not to brush your beard out  this brush is to apply bear oil and balm it does that awesomely  i use it every time now to apply the balm i use then i comb or use a stiffer bristle brush to do the actual taming of the beard  unless youve got the worlds softest beard or are using it under your belt this brush cant comb out your tanglesit does a great job applying the balm to base of the hairs

doesnt seem to work any better than othercheaper products i have used it takes the paindown about half but doesnt seem to last longa couple of hrs at most i  havent had it long so well see how it goes so far its over priced
this is a slab of generic foam covered in a nondescript and not particularly comfortable fabric it is on the short side so if you are tall like me it provides no thigh support like sitting in a chair with a tiny seat bed the slope keeps your thigh and butt muscles from relaxing because you are at an odd angle its going backi also tried the coccyx cushion from living better tools httpsmileamazoncomgpproductb00ygc7s1c its larger and quite thick it is contoured to fit your legs and has a nice nonskid rubber backing to hold it in place it costs a bit more but its a much better product as long as your chair adjusts to accommodate the fact that it is 534 highthat said body shapes are different perhaps you will love this one i didnt
this did not work as advertised my glasses still fog just as before

very difficult strapping on the harness of note is that females were used to model the harness and perhaps it is geared more toward a smaller head
i am a fan of method cleaning products ive been using the method all purpose cleaner for several years now i was trying to reduce the chemicals used in my home one of my favorite things about the method products is the scent this one has a light apple scent which smells really nice i have a stainless steel appliances in my kitchen this cleaner does a pretty good job of removing finger prints but i havent had much luck with removing the water drips on my refrigerator below the water dispenser the only thing that i have had any success with getting rid of those is the bar keepers friend stainless cleaner but now with this cleaner i can use this for frequent touch ups on refrigerator and overall on the stove and dishwasher and use the other cleaner for the water drip marks
works great on unwanted dark air etc this one is a large size jar fantastic seller it is a nice mild formula i have light sensitive skin with this product i have never had any issues
compared to other offers on amazon there isnt any comparison  these pads are great they suck up the liquid and makes my life easier  i tried others and agree theyre like using a paper towel  try them you will not be disappointed
gobble gobble gobble   the best
on our farm there are loads of dirty jobs that take their toll on nail and hands  these gloves are great  they fit close enough that they dont get in the way of most jobs  we use them in the kitchen  and in the lavender barn moving plants around watering sprinkling fertilizer  everything we like that they have long arms to protect long sleeves  theyre very sturdy and strong and we havent lost a pair yet
ive been actively using this product for now and ill probably never stop its just that good eyebrow and facial hair trimmer painless hair remover is simple to use remove the cap slide the switch on and gently press the head of the unit flat against your skin continue making small circular motions to remove any unwanted hair best part it does not hurt and does a great job removing the hair quickly
lid not sealed when i shake it to clean out water droplets go everywhere but the translucence is good can see through to see volume without having to see the pee
tasted way to horrible to keep down i tried taking it three times every time i did i threw up and had bad heartburn and kept burping the flavor which was disgusting
i really like persil but i was expecting a original german product it doesnt say it in their description so i dont want to give 1 star but i wish they would note somewhere that this is not original and is coming somewhere from eastern europe i cant even read the information on the package especially for the fact that the price is expensive and i only paid so much since i expected original german product i wonder now if it does wash the same way and as clean as the original

this is by far one of the best tools ive used for my feet when i give myself a pedicure a must have
bought this to drown out my husbands snoring and numerous other noises coming from the house at night  i cant say it really masks the snoring that much but it does help with outside noise from other rooms or outside  all in all it does help me sleep better  it gets the job done  i like that it is super compact and fits right on my night stand with plenty of room
i dont get the hype after using this brush for 2 months ive decided that life is too short to use an inferior tooli expect some shedding with a natural brush i dont expect it to still be a daily issue after 2 months the tangle in the bottom of my bowl was initially a bother and now im over it i clean out this mass every few days but unfortunately a fair amount of soap gets cleaned out too so my soap doesnt last as long as i would likeif youre the kind of guy who counts pennies or just likes to use a wellmade product make sure you add the cost of a replacement brush to your budget i hate to throw out anything before the end of its life cycle but this brush is too frustrating to continue to use im moving oni give the product 1 star and the seller 1 star for outstanding communication without his excellent followup this would be a 1star review
fabulous would buy them over and over again  barely feel them good looking scojo rules
good probiotics are pricy and this is worth it eazy to take no taste put it in my drink first thing in the am

these gloves are really cute i love the pink fingertips and both the flocked and unflocked pairs are very easy to slide on and comfortable  the sizing does run a bit large though you might consider sizing down if you are between sizesunfortunately the unflocked pair of these gloves has pretty poor puncture resistance compared to the gloves i usually use playtex nitrile  my fingernails punched through the unflocked pair the second time i used them and i wasnt being particularly rough with themthe  extra material in the flocked pair seems to offer better durability but i prefer the feel and dexterity of the unflocked pair
tasty protein bars hard to decide which flavor is best
they have some good options but for a fast lunch when not so hungry these are very tasty with no chalky protein taste
its okay the rods arent very long so it feels like you are shoving the entire thing in your ear it also came in a huge shopping box im talking a shoe box big enough for a pair of winter boots total waste
not used as intended we used to repierce holes that had grown over on the back side of my ear she was not impressed with the sharpness when used manually but the worst was the reaction by one of my ears not sure if it didnt like the material this is made of but that ear has still not healed in 3 weeks not infected just still very sore

cover fits well and allows me to wear the phonak under my shirt and protect it from the moisture when i am working and perspiring  only thing i dont care for is that cover must be pulled back to insert the charging cord  but thats a minor inconvenience
this has d3 that is called the sun vitamin and is its good for our bonesas we get older we do not absorb vitamins as good and alsothe sun although too much sun can cause cancer of the skinbefore taking d3 you should get tested toactually know how much you needi now need to take 10000 mg of d3 and i live in california andgarden everydaythe k2 mk7 and mk2 in this takes the calcium fromyour arteries to your bones and teeth that keeps the calcium from cloggingup your arteries although i likethe k2mk4 better but that one is pretty priceynow i notice there is k1 in this which surprises mek1 clots your blood and many people take a baby aspirinto thin there blood a bit for there heart as they get older so i feel that k1would defeats the reason for taking a baby aspirinif any one takes any type of a blood thinner they should not take k1 at allor talk to your dr firstim only giving this a 2 stars cause of the k1 in this

this oil is amazing i mix a various oils and make my own facial nourishing moisturizer
this silk face mask is nice against my skin and it does a great job of keeping out the light because of the lower strap there are two adjustable straps i had to adjust mine to be as wide as possible the mask still fits me tightly and because of this it keeps the light out completely excellent materials and workmanship
worked great the first 2 times and now its dull and doesnt really work waste of money
nice product fast shipping great on neck and head  after a year still working well just noisy
if you have a teen ager this is way cheaper than acne cream
in september i purchased one of these it worked as it should for two weeks approximately 15 hours total use on day 15 when i turned it on it had only half the brightness and a blackish film coating the inside of it i messaged the seller light bulbs international and they were kind enough to send me out a replacement the replacement worked out great for exactly 7 days today day 8 the replacement bulb went bad and developed the same blackish blue film inside it again after approximately 20 minutes the bulb just went out i removed it from the fixture to find that one of the filaments had broken see pictures attached this is so frustrating perhaps these bulbs are just old stock or from a defective batch its not my fixture i had been and am using now a ge bulb that i purchased at my local hardware store that works without issue as of september 2020 do not purchase these bulbs  they are defective these sylvania bulbs used to be the best i have used them for many years and each one lasted several years the bulbs here are junk

i like the wide variety of mushrooms included in this mushroom supplement and am always glad to see chaga mushroom included though i dont know how much of it is in this supplement i buy chaga separately as a powder because it is so incredibly good for the immune system all of these mushrooms in this supplement are extremely good for health and there is nothing i can find negative to say about it
i have allergies so these are great for folks who need to blow their nose  a lot

so i normally dont take the time to write a review like this but after having purchased this product as well as anothernaturez ayurveda joint pain relief for my wife to help her with ongoing pain issues in her knee i found that it in fact worked for her at least from what i was being toldwhen i injured my shoulder i thought to try it before taking medications and let me tell you it worked so well i nearly forgot i had an injured shoulder at all for hours it lasted about 4 or 5 hoursthis will be a product i will be going to first when i have joint pain to be sure
what i like about this product is it comes with a teeth whitening pen and a desentizing serum esp for sensitive teeth like mine the strips sticks well with the gums and there is a cooling effect the results are comparable with the branded ones i was confused though with how often you get to apply it it says full 14 days treatment so that would mean 14 days consecutive days
i bought this to take while breastfeeding our daughter who had severe reflux i started by taking two every evening and within 24 hours my daughter was remarkably different i also noticed it helped me with feeling less abdominal cramps and also helped my reflux calm down significantly i would highly recommend this for many reasons
i had high hopes for this item but it didnt go well from the start  as it says in the information sent with the device this is not a hearing aid and if you have problems with your hearing then you need to contact a doctor  honestly if you think you need an item like this then thats exactly what you need to do  you need to contact a professional so that you can get some real assistancethis device is marketed to baby boomers of which i am one  but this is a very challenging device in many ways  many baby boomers and most seniors would never be able to set the device up   much less be able to operate it once its all pluggedin  this is the reason the jitterbug cell phone was created    keep it simple  this device is anything but simple especially for those for whom it is supposed to be geared toward most seniors do not want   need   or desire fancy gadgets with lots of buttonsif this item were 5995 then i would give it higher marks   but   its not  its many times that and not worth iti was able to set it up without too much difficulty but i know many of my friends would have simply left it in the box  even if someone had their child or grandchild set it up for them they still will be lost as to how to operate itthree of the functions  modes i just dont get  if you need a headset for a telephone then you can get one very inexpensively  no need for this  if you have trouble hearing people and carrying on a conversation with someone then you probably need to see a professional about having your hearing tested and acquiring a real device for assistance  i dont know anyone who wants to walk around with what looks to be an odd mp3 player with earplugs to talk to people  the third function of playing sounds is just kind of annoying  at first i thought it might be nice   but   i was listening to what i would call waves   its obviously on a loop playing the sounds over and over   but   there is a beginning and an end    so when the loop finishes its not a smooth transition to start playing again  you notice where it ends and then starts again  personally this is very annoying  it should be a seamless loopnow for the one function that does indeed work and i actually like    watching tv  once you set it up you can actually listen to tv and it works just fine i like this because i live in a condo and though the walls a quite thick i still dont want to turn the tv up too loud and there have been times when it would have been more enjoyable to have a headset like this  granted there are a few issues with this also  first it will work with just one tv because you have to run a cord from the tv to the base of the device  second the information shows that the battery will last about 65hours in tv mode  granted thats a bit of time but if its a weekend and you want to watch a lot it still might not be enough  it takes 5hours to charge the device as well  also if you have the earplugs in to watch tv then if you have other people around you youre probably not going to be able to socialize  youre either going to be watching tv with the earplugs in   or    not have the earplugs in and socializing  also the earplugs are not all that comfortable  im assuming i can use other earplugs or earphones i find more comfortable  i havent tried that yet but im assuming it will workbut even though i like the tv part    there are much less expensive and better options if thats really what youre looking for  i did a search on amazoncom and there are some great options    a lot less expensive     and cordless
good shears they are more greenish neon yellow than the picture describes
i have been using this for several years and was happy with this product until last week  for some reason when i put in my contact lens  it the heck out of my eye hydrogen peroxide did not convert  but also about a one inch long line on my skin just outside my eye it burned my skin  ive decided to research and find a different safer product  i did not purchase this product through amazon but am looking at reviews of others concerning this
get ready to progressgag this stuff is rancid but effective af kid you not though its inedible i put a shot of water in it and just throw it back and chase it with a spoonful of peanut butter the price of beauty
these fit in my cloth masks very well filtered out allergens and did not cause my glasses to fog i need more so just waiting for a restock
i lve this style of back scrubber not just for my back but for the back of my legs and even the bottoms of my feet  i highly recommend them especially if you are not as physically limber as you used to me like me
i am forever putting my glasses down and covering them up when i am working so i am constantly searching for my glasses when i could be working these are a great buy for a set of three different colors and are well made no more losing my glasses
i was told by my boss at a dry cleaners that this is the domestic version of the commercial stain remover he uses in his process you cannot believe the results he gets after running out of the bag he gave me i tried this formulation it takes considerably more but is worth it it removes stains of all types and whitens beautifully best results are achieved by using hot water and giving a soak but it will also work in lower tempshint run an inch or two of water in your bathtub add some biz and detergent soak squeeze dont wring dont drain and then wash in a normal wash i do heavy stains overnight then lesser ones in the same water this removed blue shampoo from a white cotton shower curtain that was marked cold hang to dry that saved me the cost of replacing the curtain
a nice basic moisturizer that absorbs like a dream and keeps skin plump i mix it with cicaplast to moisturize mature skin and heal mild acne overnight could be used as an eye and neck cream the product comes in a large tube and is unscented clean and effective
blends great very subtle flavor ive used it for smoothies but when i realized it doesnt taste awful i started using it to cook toastersized protein pancakes to store in my freezer
this facial scrub is chunks of cacao nibs and the hydrating mask the pieces of nibs are so large they mostly just hurt my face its like rubbing pebbles on your face the hydrating mask feels very nice but i cant get over the pebbly nibs
i cant directly  say how good this  works since  am nursing i didnt  realize its not for recommend  for anyone  nursing or pregnant but i have been giving it to my  son who is a picky eater and my sister  takes it and she claims its been helpful  to her stomach i have also noticed  less constipation in my sonfor the benefits this gives the price is good
i already have the lower leg protector and can vouch it is an excellent product and really keeps your cast or dressing dry  i sent this one for the arm back because it is the same exact thing as the lower leg product  if all you need is protection for the handwristelbow  dont hesitate to get it
they are filling
it wasnt a pleasant experience for him or me he had been doing keto with me and didnt eat anything other than meat of course he got gout because i eat a lot of protein rich foods i like to have this to break down the uric acid i havent had gout and dont intend to get it so i keep well hydrated and use supplements like this the minerals are great for you and you will feel better
these fit very well they do reduce noise but also muffles sounds you want to hear definitely just a reduction not full hearing protection
does this product actually help yes i believe it does how much of it is the placebo effect i dont know the answer to that question all i can tell you is that i did feel some of the benefit that this product claimedits not a huge investment and im of the opinion that when it comes to things like this they cant hurt and could very well help keep in mind that every persons body is differentwishing you the best of luck on your health journey
i bought this twice the first time it was so clumpy the second time still had clumps but way less i think the first bag was older the new bag fresher i used this 23x daily as a poultice for about 6 weeks and my 9mm displaced fracture was fused 7 weeks post break i used it in combo with the homeopathic symphytum 1 pellet in my water daily great product but so so clumpy
this is a cute sugar bowl doesnt take up much space but looks pretty good the spoon is small but just the right size
nice dose amount of over 400mg of saw palmetto with 25 elderberry  this is a slight blend that the bottle label recommends one a day  thats easy for me  the other thing that is nice and easy is the clear bottle  now i can see how much i have left  wish every bottle was clearno fillers too and easy to swallow with liquidtrust you found this review honest and helpful
i think these sticks must be made out of some kind of root at least thats what they feel like i dont like the smell or taste of them but they do work well to clean the teethat least the front teeth i had a hard time getting the brush on the back side of my teeth if you like these miswak sticks they do work very well to clean the teeth and i did feel they helped my gums in the processi went online and searched for more information and found out that dogs can chew these sticks too and it will help clean their teeth so i gave the sticks to my dogs and they happily chewed them until they were gone
excellent oil i put it in my coffee every morning
we love dreft and this product helps with the tough stains we have used it on everyones clothes and i am so pleased with the results it works well when used with the detergent
even though it smells like old cheese it provides the essential butyric acid that becomes deficient in older people
excellent product and a really great value
no side effects not too large and a fairly neutral taste high quality ingredients for added nutritional insurance to a persons diet
this seems to work fine for making ejuice came sealed in a sturdy bottle slightly sweet ill be buying more
this is a unique blend of plantbased protein with antiinflammatory ingredients like tart cherry and turmeric its very low in net carbs and is ideal for anyone on a keto or diabetic diet the vanilla cold brew flavor is delicious i like this as a postworkout recovery drink i highly recommend this productthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier

so at times it doesnt take a reading but i have found it accurate now after a few days in a row of confirmed ketosis sometimes you just have to wait and try the reading again but i think for the price it is a good deal
this is a very nice product put together with care and consideration i even got a crystal i never heard of a lionstone which is like a more solidly covered tigerseye with a wonderful shifting gold layer ah i love it the whole set is great and the pamphlet accompanying also very nice the only complaint really is that the little set of stones arent identified and explained its still a pleasing purchase tho the bags are adorable too
the top strap is far too small to even get over my head so the brace is useless i have purchased others that are very good but this isnt im keeping it for the cages extenders and filters but the brace is useless
bottle lid was broken  other than that good product
use these to brush my infant sons teeth  they are soft they clean well and he loves to chew on them
i use two bags to get thegood flavor will continue to drink this tea works in the infuser as well
this thing is life hits all my spots unlike most men and their girlfriends man im snarky af
i would carry the flat piece in my purse to apply under my puffy eyes from allergies and when visiting family who live in a metropolis full of smog car gets covered in filth from the residual smog really helped my fiance when he went through coffee withdrawals too
yummy mix it with kodiak mix
i doubt i would use this body brush in the shower because i think if it gets wet its going to be more likely to lose bristles but as a dry skin brush it is awesome its comfortable to hold the handle wrapping ensures a good grip and its long enough to be able to reach your whole back or all the way down to your feet without being so huge its unwieldy for doing your arms and front torsoif youve never tried dry brushing you should its stimulating to your skin helps remove dead flaky skin better than wetshowering does and has a number of benefits for health google it one thing dry brushing is good for is to help open up the skin to allow ingrown hairs like i have on my legs from using an epilator to surfacethis brush which i received at a discount in exchange for my honest review will hang on the side of my vanity to remind me to pick it up and do a little dry brushing while im otherwise occupieda great multitasking habit to get into
magnets feel out after a few weeks but did help the soles
cheap poor quality it didnt fit my 1930s claw foot tub faucet and  broke when we tried to replace the the faucet connector with one that did fit
this is probably my 4th walker  because it is lighter than the other walkers i can turn it with one hand because of the smaller wheels it is easy to maneuver it in the house i would recommend it  it also folds up easily
on time and as described
good quality product as described and looks as per photo provided
i have been using this for almost 10 years now  i love it  just wish the price would be more reasonable  its terribly expensive for such a small amount
tart cherries are credited with easing inflammation accelerating muscle recovery and  easing insomnia i much prefer nutriceuticals to pharmaceuticals these capsules are easy to swallow and the user is to take up to three a day with meals i have been taking them and cant say ive noticed any impact good or bad however my mother who suffers from arthritis and my brother who has a chronic knee problem both reported noticeable improvement they have been taking one capsule a day my brother now forgoes his advil for this supplement tart cherry juice is an expensive acquired taste these capsules are a cost effective way to reap the benefits of tart cherry without fuss or muss
this collagen protein powder is so nice my wife mixed in with her coffee and barely noticed a taste from it it dissolves perfectly too no lumps if you sniff the container upon opening you notice a slight smell to it but its light and not overpowering this stuff is great
these fit as expected and fit well  they are snug as to be expected with compression socks  the color and style are cute they wash well
in overall quality these are one step below foster grant folding glasses
first time user it took me a while a find out how to assemble them after some adjustments i find a way to use it and it does helps relieve my neck pain
love these easy multitasking bleach tablets beats carrying home a big old jug of bleachwalmark has been out of them since pademic hit and was so glad to find hear
i absolutely love all of the different scents in this big set all really good quality scents and work great in my diffusers my house smells just amazing with these
truly the besttried megsorb and allthis wins it all
its soothing and somewhat long lasting the scent is really what i expected
great way to get vitamin c that isnt from cornbased crap
they work they will cut a penny and get you naked fast enough the black paint will come off if scraped but they were pretty affordable look cool and they do what they are suppose to i feel comfortable having these on the rig with me
im not keen on this  i love perlier products and have used two others in the past  but this honey liguria doesnt have much of a scent  i like these bath creams scented  ive been tempted to return it but then  it does leave the skin soft and smooth
these are my favorite tissues the cube box is always better than the rectangle these are soft and have a simple box thats not too distracting
its exactly as pictured and described i cant find any fault in the container
the size said it would fit a size 10 which i am but these were to small they were tight i didnt use them they were cheaply made dr scholls could have made something more comfortable
ordered thus as it is supposedly helpful with joint pain then found out is not good for me as i am on a blood thinner check with your dr before taking
so a couple of things i noticed i did this on a day where the back half of the house was in full sun and the front was in shade the windows in the back were super hot and the crystals from this started showing instantly and seemed to come out better so people with poor results on this might try heating up the window with a blow dryer first or something if its cold out the front windows still did decent just took them some time to dry and the crystals to show upi can say from experience dont overdo it all at once on a window if you do then youll get runs in your crystals and it detracts from them a bit so lightly spray the window and let it dry for a bit and once its dry to touch decide if you need to follow up with another coatpro tip if you want it to look professional then use a piece of cardboard along the edges as you spray or tape all of your window trim with masking tape before spraying this especially around darker window frames if you have white window frames then it probably wouldnt be an issue i have dark brown aluminum frame windows and the over spray of this looks kinda junky it does wipe off though so i just have to find time and go out and wipe the edges down for a cleaner lookoverall im truly amazed by the frozen window look these created i did it for privacy and you cant see past it it looks great its very classy looking
bought this for a sprained ankle because i am spoiled and refused to use crutches anyway chose this scooter because it was on the low side for a next day delivery scooter on cost and there is a basket and the basket is metal there ya go this scooter ticked all my boxes so i purchased very pleased delivery was truly next day and it worked very well im sure i will be lending it out to family  as needed for many many years to come
very pleased with my purchase
the first time i bought this product it tasted wonderful so i reordered it i tried the new tube instead of tasting like cinnamon  the new batch tasted like old horrible tasting medicine i sure wont get it until they go back to the old formula
they work great
happy with product
these work fine but i didnt use it
too small and they fall over
i love to give myself pedicures but this spa bath didnt even turn on after i prepared the water and stuff and plugged it up
you can not beat the price for the amount of hydrated water you get  you can buy at the grocery store and by the time you add up the amount you pay you will save so much by buying this and making your own hydrated water  not to mention its delivered right to you with amazon and no need to go to the store so glad i purchased will be buying again for sure
im not that familiar with myrrh as a fragrance or therapeutic oil though ive had several brands and types of therapeutic grades of oil  but this brand is very pleasing and looks to be pureit lasts a good amount of time in my diffuser and the fragrance is very nice i combined this with frankincense
these are absolutely worthless  i bought them assuming they would work like others that foam up into the sink and clean while foaming  these have absolutely no foaming or cleaning ability that i can tell and they dont get rid of any smells
these work very well a lot of power in a a small package i use floor models in other rooms these in the bathrooms they are an excellent product
placed this in a low airflow side of my apartment not far from the front door i can tell it helps to keep the pollen and dust down i dont have to dust my black glass furniture near as often as before
i liked the unit but after very little use one of the wheels got all wobbly because the bearings fell apart i returned the unit for a refund
these are the best file out there imo the are small and will slip into any purse pocket travel bag luggage etc i have one with me at all times and the others are in travel bags and luggage so i never forget to grab one they file nails smoothly and even give a shine please click like if this is helpful to you happy shopping
lots of boxes of tissue for the price more than i expected
i cannot recommend these the design works well if you have problems with your hands but the materials dont last ive purchased these twice the first lasted pretty long 1 12 years then the end of the plastic shaft snapped and it came apart  i ordered another which lasted only 4 months before breaking at the same location
some of the capsules were clumped together too many of them actually
to be honest my husband did not use this for a balding head he wanted to try it for his face and for noseear hairs this is his review this was a nice mans shaver it has several attachments which are easy to change out and install the shave i got was super close and it was easy to maneuver it over the contours of my face i have to admit it is one of the best shaves i have had in the past few years and for the money it is a good deal the nose trimmer worked well with no pain or irritation highly recommend
very nice
i live in s la where we just had catastrophic flooding and developed eczema due to the use of concentrated chemicals to kill mold i used several natural thingsoregon grapeworked ok  coconut oil msm cream w tea tree sunfood productworked incredible for the itch butskin would not heal and became worse to major blistersbleeding tears to my eyes at time i started using this 2 days agoapplying 5 times a day and it has cleared up almost completely wished i wouldve known this 5 weeks ago but truly was the only thing that healed my hands dry skin peeling blisters itch inflammation hands are 80 well after a few days i do recommend msm cream tea tree for itch  worked fabulously but swedish bitters is the only thing that wiped the dry skin inflammation bleeding cracking  itching too
i really liked the description of these and also the reviews that said they blocked all noise well not for me i read the directions and followed them to a t the earplugs would not stay in my ears no matter how long i held them so they could reinflate it was a waste of money for me
suggested by nd for temporary onetime episode of skin inflammation  worked ok
do not waste your money
love this tea it really takes your appetite away
wow what a game changer for me especially at work im much more focused and my mood is balanced super helpful during hormone spikes
they dont block any noise at all  i tried inserting them many different ways  followed the directions precisely  theyre worthless
i liked the results it gives
i am always looking for new natural supplements to put in my green smoothies  we tend to eat more healthy around my house so this looked really intriguing to me  lets see how it performedwhat is this powder likethis powder is green and comes in a foil resealed package  it also comes with a little scoop to measure withodorthis has very little odortastethis does taste like gooseberries without the severe tart twist that our bushes of gooseberries havehow does it perform in smoothiesi find that using a scoop in a vitamix sized smoothie is not enough to alter the taste so much that people wont drink it  this powder ads a bit of a twist to the smoothie that i find refreshing  it is not that bad and if i dip my finger in the powder and eat it it is almost a buttery slightly tart feelingany reactionswe have had no bad reactions to this  as for vitamin c in the winter i love having this available to put in smoothies as vitamin c tends to be really sour in nature  this is far nicer to have  keep in mind it is only a tiny bit of vitamin c and not therapeutic amounts  this is not for battling sicknessthe bottom linefor a nice natural additive to smoothies or other foods that increase nutritional content but dont overwhelm taste this is a nice powder  i have enjoyed using it for quite a few weeks nowmy ratingi am giving this four stars  it is pleasant tasting and not overwhelming and i like including it in smoothies
i put these in a pair of cheap slip on shoes  they are easy to cut to size and fit perfectly  they are super comfortable and converted a pretty horrible pair of shoes into a a super comfortable pair  so far they are holding up very well and have not skid around at all  it does take a couple hours of walking for these to mold to your foot shape but once they are broken in they remain super comfortable  great inserts
bought to use around the house to keep mice away
cute yoda looks just like pics however doesnt stay on to well and toothpaste gets clogged and crusty in it
absolutely love this set love the colorful filers the size is helpful for gripping the glass file is so unique and works incredibly well excellent value too
potent as it says it is i love this product the energy is great and i needed this
these soft earplugs worked great on my last airplane flight it blocked out the sound from the engine and a crying baby i like these better than the kind you squish and push in your ear the comfort is better and they remove so easily with the tab for removal the carrying  case is nice to keep them secure and from being lost
i was given this product to test out and give my opinion as to what i think about it first it arrived swiftly i will have to update this since i just recently received it but since i do deal with problems of circulation due to so sooo many cancer surgeries it feels good to gently move both of these against the skin the one rolls along the skin the other rounded one is for specific areas but i would suggest that maybe having a handle with a softer grip might be a good idea but the concept is a good one well see if i can give a more detailed feedback as far as how it is working on my skin soon restoring circulation is a big plus for me though love the color too g
perfect for keeping produce fresh i wouldnt be without them
i buy these for myself not kids i love them
this is my new favorite daily vitamin totally vegan easy to swallow and fills all the daily requirements of my 60aged body i have a tendency to skip breakfast most days a week and this vitamin agrees with an empty stomach no aftertaste burping or unpleasant stomach rumblings this is a lot cheaper than my usual centrum formula so amazon has once again turned me away from name brands and over to their store brand names i highly recommend for any woman over age 40 who cares about their health
my sister has incredible peripheral neuropathy in her feet they burn  then go numb this was sent to her i really dont know if shes using it  in 71 years shes never taken my advice on anything but shes in so much pain she actually asked me for ideas fingers crossed
a waste of money personally i regret i bought this thought it would be fun but the scratch off was already lifted
35 stars these were bough as an emergency fix and worked in a pinch but the hand rests are not palm friendly and were very uncomfortable for my son people who use forearm crutches all the time need curved hand rests for comfort these were inexpensive and quick delivery
this pet pill syringe makes giving medication much easier i have one dog that runs at the sounds of the pill bottle because she loves the pocket treats and another who you have to hold down to take anything  we have tried everything to get her to take pills and she always spits them out with this pill syringe we are able to force them down her throat with the first attempt the syringe comes with two different sizes but currently we only need one the syringe also allows you to put water with the pill which i think makes it harder to spit out this is a great addition to the monthly routine for our animalsi have received this pet pill syringe at a discounted price or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product i provide my product review as though i paid full price for it the views expressed here are my own based on my personal use and experience with the product and are unbiased and honest reviews any feedback positive or negative regarding this product is based on my personal experience with the product i have not been asked to provide positive feedback nor have i received any compensation or incentive from the company for this review i use reviews when purchasing a product and take the task of reviewing products seriously like most people i rely heavily on product reviews when deciding to purchase an item from a particular manufacturer or company if you feel this review has been helpful please click the yes button
this inexpensive scale seemed to work ok for most of the first year after i bought it  it tended to vary a bit from weigh to weigh even within minutes but seemed to be in the right ballpark  it is attractive and very readable  but then at about the one year mark of ownership the weight shown went out of whack not by a huge amount but by enough that i knew there was a problem  i tried new batteries but that made no difference  so i am throwing it away and have ordered a more highly rated and more expensive scale  id like to get one that will last for yearsupdate  to my utter surprise the company reached out to me shortly after i published the review above  they processed an immediate and full refund to my credit card and have offered me a replacement scale  i should have called them as soon as the problem developed and im sure they would have replaced the scale then and there
beautiful true cobalt blue bottles i tried to change the roller to a metal one but it wouldnt roll changed out the complete plastic hub and used the metal ball and it worked great love these
smells great does not perform as well as other detanglers
top cover doesnt cover whole compartment and supplies fall out had alot better med bags had to switch back to my old bag because it kept letting equipment fall out
we all know we should be eating more greens this is an easy way to do so the powder can be added to any liquid you could also bake with it or add it to sauces its quite versatile i highly recommend itthanks so much for taking the time to read this review i hope the information that ive provided makes your decision a little easier
a hit at the party
i just received this item and i hadnt even tried it on but i could tell from the feel of it i made an excellent choice if you need a head strap for plastic frames that slide down your nose as mine always do get this product it is even better than i had hoped the strap is very lightweight you wont even know you have it on i wear behindtheear hearing aids  the pieces that attach to my frames are very thin and pliable and fit nicely in my crowded ear space the part that goes behind your head has a velcro fastener with the very cool company name on it the strap sits low on my neck and is hardly noticeable even with a shaved head this strap is well worth your money and will do the job perfectly the only available color is black  i would have preferred some other  but because of how well it works i can easily overlook the matter order today
my boyfriend and i are highly impressed with this set there are two pretty lilac heating and cooling wraps we heated them in the microwave for two minutes each one they come out really warm and are soothing as a neck wrap to lay over the shoulder around the arm or leg  these can also be used cold by putting them in a waterproof plastic bag in the refrigerator for at least four hours to chill we personally only use these for heat therapythere is velcro along one end to keep the wrap in place one has to be careful not to let the velcro touch any delicate clothing because it is strong and can damage delicate fabrics like sweaters the wraps are unscented and made of clay beads and millet as a result of the ingredients they are heavy these wraps cannot be washed they can only be surfaced cleanedthe current price of 2299 for these two wraps is very reasonable we are both highly impressed
didnt work  maybe my butt is hopeless
dont waste your money no difference between this one and the cheaper version this one is extremely loud and vibrates so hard on high that the attachments actually vibrates off the intensity is nothing to write home about save your money and purchase the wahl therapeutic model
i have been wanting to use both coconut oil and activated charcoal for my teeth whitening and overall health but i have a strong gag reflex making me nervous about the taste and consistency i ordered this product and love it ive had no issues with gaging like i worried using some of the ingredients in the product alone it also works great to brighten up my teeth and leave them feeling fresh
gave me a bad headache after about 3 nights of usage
my boys love these brushes they like being able to choose a different color each night
ive used dr b dental solutions ultrasonic cleaner every night since i got it i love it
bought many for friendsunobtrusive but great reminderputting it in a drawer when you dont need it it lasts wont just keep going off  since there isnt an off button this is a huge plus
this was a gift for our godson who we were told loved it  the whole family enjoyed playing the game
this works good usually have to buy just the eyebrow shaver for more and i have to worry about finding a battery this has more attachments and a usb charger glad i got it
this is a good basic mask  people who want more decoration can use post earrings as i do
the product is exactly as expected but the order did not come with the pump as described
like many of you i have persistent neck pain  this looked great  dont be fooled  i disliked this so much that i threw it away  i had my wife try it out to make sure it was not just me  she did not like it at all eitheri tried this many times never ever did i think it did anything  i hate to say this but this is a waste of time and money
we had an infestation of pantry moths in our pantry and had to throw out a lot of dried food like crackers cereals some dried figs and items that are high in carbohydrates  the rotten little monsters could smell what i had in ziploc bags and burrowed right through them to the food  besides waging serious war with the moths ive placed a lot of food items in these smellproof bags in the hopes if there are any moths left that we didnt eradicate that they will not be able to smell the food through the bags and thus burrow into them  so far it seems to be working but we also having found any moths stuck to the fly strips we hung up in there either so thats a good sign we might have gotten them all  these bags seem well made and should last a long time
cheap made a waste of money
these are light weigh but very supportive make your legs feel tireless
few times a day i add about 14 teaspoon to a small amount of water and it is pretty much tasteless  easy to take i am using it for severe joint hypermobility syndrome which results in loss of collagen  the rheumatologist who diagnosed me suggested powder might be easier than pills and i went straight for powder
amazing product im so happy i finally bought a tongue scraper it really makes a difference i felt like i was suffering from build up on my tongue it felt awful but this help a ton
these are reasonably comfortable but the padding is too thin they feel cheap from the start and the padding compresses immediately so you dont get much benefit the padding is stitched to the mesh i  two places but even though i folded it in thirds to make it thicker it still didnt help protect my elbow would have helped to have a hard shell on the outside so these were a fail for me and im still looking for something better
after trying another brand that was just off enough to not fit my ocedar spin mop i was really hoping i wouldnt have a problem with thesefortunately they fit and are a pretty good substitute as a generic form for your spin mopyou have to press down really hard in order to get them to stay but they are a much more inexpensive option
having spent 263 at the podiatrist to clip an ingrown toe nail which was too thick for me to trim was delighted to be asked to review these toe nail clipper and cuticle trimmersi used the clipper last night on thick ingrown toenail and it clipped it easily mayo clinic says to cut ingrown nails straight across  if you google mayo clinic they tell you how to treat ingrown toenails at home which is very helpful i am hoping that having these clippers will help to solve the ingrown toenail problemthey have a plastic guard and come in a leather case which zippers to close it and keep the instruments safe so it is good for storing and travelam very happy with this setreview sample provided
they work just as described  a good number of these will come in handy  they arrived promptly too
these are nicer than previous used because of the gripper knob they really exfoliate my skin and make it soft and clean it was a good buy and came quickly
ive always read lots of great reviews about the stuff and thought i would try the stuff was horrible are used it to wash my gallardo and it left shiny little greasy chemical marks all over the car it wasnt possible to remove i ended up using my go to stoners quick bead detail and that did the trick that stuff is awesome and can use on every part of your car does not leave streaks and better tan actual window cleaner on the windows
gift for xmas also put in an extra bulb  this will be put next to a cat box hope it works like reviews said
i tried several brushes over the last several months and love the kozis wooden bath brush amazon item  b08hr2gbhc the best however this one is very good toothe brush head side is ample for good coverage the bristles are of medium softness the massaging side is not useful to me because i have no desire to use that in fact i do not even understand why anyone would use that the brush is hefty and is one solid piece which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes i tried previously it also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower in addition a selfstick hook is supplied if needed but i did not use itbesides the massaging brush head that i find useless the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than i would like many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back nevertheless this is still very functional and it is very well madeoverall i like this brush even though it comes in second to the kozis i love the current price of 1199 is about right for a twosided wooden brush
these gummies are a wonderful blend to help boost your immunitya similar blend in capsules would be very large and difficult for some people to swallowi got the 2 pack so i dont run out as quickly with the whole family taking itelderberry is one of my favorite supplementsthese are tasty not too sweet and easy to chew
i love it ive only had it for a few days and already i have noticed a difference in my sleep pattern ive always had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep i slept like a rock with this thing on i dont remember waking up more than once which is a miracle for me ill have a hard time if i ever have to sleep without it now
i am addicted to these sponges as i hate houswork and they speed through a lot of cleaning chores that used to involve a lot of products and scrubbing i now have clean counters a clean stove and generally much cleaner kitchen with very little effort
use for fog and haze weathergray skyfog weather dust weather snow weather building site etcnot for medical use it has 3 layers and covers my whole face i feel like it will protect me and those i come in contact with and the price was right  the ear loops are comfortable and the nose piece keeps my glasses from fogging
i hadnt used a glade candle in awhile but i thought these might be ok  i do not like whatever they use in the wicks it gives a nasty smell  i would not recommend this brand of candles if you are used to yankee or other clean burning soy candles like i am you will probably notice the same stink i do if so
if youre using them fast it is great but mine got dry within a couple days
work as advertised i do a lot of parties and always have years this helps extremely well if you want to be able to still hear people in the music this product is for you
great vg good flavorless base for vapers and diy juices
the tissues themselves are fine they clean and wipe snot as well as dirt and food of the face or counter are soft and do not irritate the packaging while compact is a bit off putting since the tissues are so jampacked together its hard to pull them out in the beginning without pulling a whole wad of them as well tearing several of them but the tissues themselves serve well as any regular tissues
comfortable easy to wear i wear it almost all the time
when i cant burn sage i will use this  great smell too
we buy a lot of supplements to aid in our immunity as a family because we have small children that attend school the tincture prevents or halts the illness i dont know if its coincidence or because of this fantastic product daily i have taken the recommended 15 to 60 drops half the dropper days that i take the product i do not contract any illness and i feel great then sometimes i forget and see that im getting sick like a scratchy throat or some congestion i start taking it and it halts the illness and i was a 99 of the time the illness does not become worse after taking this product all in all i would have to say this is a five star product and a fantastic supplement to have in your home if especially if you have family members that are immunocompromised
the space is great but its small enough to fit in the small pocket of my purse the design is gorgeous and exactly as shown exceeds my expectations
works on my hair beautifully only complaint i have is the placement of the buttons i keep changing the temp every time i use it the 34bristle34 area does get very very hot so do not let young ones use this or touch my hair is naturally straight and this gives it a very sleek and lovely look took it on vacation and was able to pack it easily
works better than the waxed king  gets the particles out better
the lining makes a big difference
reasonably priced nice quality quick delivery
i have several microfiber towels as they are easy to fit into bags when packing for a trip there have been several camping trips where these have been a lifesaver in terms of not taking up a lot of precious space in backpacks this towel however is much thinner and not as absorbent as the other admittedly more expensive ones that ive purchased  it feels cheaper and not as soft and velvety as others  the velcro works fine and the length is good  i would not recommend this for a larger person or a person with a wide chest as i dont think it would be comfortabletoo tight
received 2 batteries  both work
attempted to install holder onto holder  clips on both sides broke off  made of hard plastic and have no give  commode piping needs to be smaller than toilet holder
i got this ovacue wireless fertility monitor for my daughter who only has one ovary due to having to have one removed she is young and is looking so forward to starting a family but her cycles are not regular this monitor is working better for her than any other tests or means they have tried she said it was easy to set up easy to use and seems to be accurate she can really see what is happening on charts made from the daily test results and there is lots of helpful information throughout it is still early but im hopeful that i will be told that she is expecting soonthis really is a great monitor for women like her and others who have struggled with health issues and with other tests and trials of this and that that have been nothing but letdowns this is really something great and different highly recommended
better than i expected
the wax worked well  my daughters red mustang is very shiny
tried once
this comes in a nice box thats a little big for the bottle of lotion theres also a bunch of nicely colored purple stuffing the lotion has little to no scent which it is supposed to it has a nice consistency not too thick not too thin and it soaks in pretty quickly without being greasy the pump is really sturdy and shaped like a cute leaf
i prefer these containers over the resealable bags that sometimes will not reseal also easier to spoon out of this and comes with a measuring spoon good quality powder with that irish mossy taste yumm lol wish it came in a larger size or maybe it does and i have not seen it yet
great fit and great price and fast delivery
bought these for my husband  they have a good grip and were easy to hold onto  i also likes that they have a larger clip area as your toenails are larger than your finger tips general speaking  they are heavy and sharp  i feel as though they will last for some to come i never hesitate to update my reviews if new info should seem useful  they arrived quickly i have prime and in good condition along with a few other things i had ordered
i use essential oils in my diffusers and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect for that this is also great for those who make body butters or other lotionsthe fragrance is  clean and masculine and smells like a good soap i use anywhere from 3  5 drops in my diffuser depending on the size of my water reservoir the resulting aroma is lovelythe current price of 1599 for this large 338 fluid ounce bottle is reasonable as it comes to less than 5 per ounce
my two girls went nuts over these bath bombsfirst of all they are packaged nicely and none of them came chipped or brokenthey are lightly scented and lightly dyed this makes me feel better as us ladies have to take precaution when bathing especially with harsh soaps and dyes they are definitely not lush quality but still work well and look nice
with all the growth in technology im not sure how optimums stuff still tastes bad very chalky and bitter
this stuff is like a miracle i use it for all kinds of things burns cuts blemishes heals fast
i use it as a toner at night but also as a makeup remover i dont use to much makeup i will be buying it frequently
the lotion does everything it says protects from bugs and is an excellent sunscreen avon did well in producing this product as well as the pump spray and aerosol cani will certainly buy this product again if needed in the future
i wanted to like because of the price i paid but it is too harsh to cut the beard compares to reddington brand for example i wont be able to use it returning
doesnt matter how i feel because its good for youalittle bitter but heynot everything good for you will be how you want it
nice tattoo it lasted a few days even with showers would definitely consider repurchasing
as my husband and i get older we are realizing why our parents would be so frustrated for the fact that hair is now growing in all the wrong places my face has some unwanted hair and my husbands nose and ears are getting a few stragglers every now and then this tool is rechargeable so no need to worry about batteries and has many different attachments it came packaged well it cuts without being in danger of cutting skin which is super important when trimming your nose or ears and cant really see what youre doing exactly what i expected the product to do
removes odors effectively and has a nice smell
this is a good product but the packaging makes scooping out the bottom third annoying  i kept my own scoop in the bag as the one that came with the product is too small also calling this a wheatgrass shot is deceptive as a wg shot is pure juice squeezed from the wheatgrass  not dehydrated grass mixed in water
very cute halloween decorations that include a variety of items to decorate with will be fun to decorate with closer to halloween i know my kids will enjoy them when i put them up
i appreciate this item i need these gloves to do my limited shopping and other activities  such  paying my bills by going to the post office  amazon thank you for listing this item in your inventory
this is my second unit my daughter took my first one fells great on sore muscles
i would venture to say that darned few havent purchased puffs tissues at least once while shopping at the grocery store or drug store puffs with lotion are about as soft and comforting as tissues get this post aims more towards the convenience of having them delivered to your door on your schedule rather than having to remember them when shopping always nice to have a tissue handy when fighting a cold or the flu
this thing is huge so im disappointed and now ill be sending it back  the problem i had was it is not as well built as people said on here the actual sides are each ok and seem to be solidhowever the hinge is cheap and doesnt line up the cups so its just very annoying and seems like itll fall apart easilysending back
one of the letters had a hole in it when we received it we had to tape it for it to stay inflated
great purchase couldnt beat the price with the amount that came with it
been using it for  years as part of my supplements regimen  never felt better
these gummy vitamin c supplements are great i love that they include bioflavonoids i do dislike the amount of vitamin c per gummy but that is pretty standard youll have to take 4 of these to equal one pack of emergenc they taste great and are a good option for kids
it was a nice buy i wear glasses so i have a hard time with it because the light really hurts my eyes i think i will gift it to my niece
have tried so many things for my heels with improvement  this stuff  just about the best thing ever and works like a charm  buy it you wont regret it  highly recommend
really great for getting hard water stains out of the toilet bowl its the only thing that removes hard water buildup from our toilets
i was hopeful that this product could help even a little bit but all i got was a very tender and painful 34chest34 after losing over 100 lbs my bust was well lets just say sad im in my early 20s and feel that plastic surgery should be a last resort so i thought id try these 34vitamins34 coupled with specific exercises after three weeks of taking them religiously my bust began to be extremely sore even the slightest bump was quite painful and i felt it was in my best interest to stop my chest didnt change at all nothing zip nada
i purchased this in pink and the dusty rose color is misleading  it is a hot pinkhowever thats my only real complaint  i have adhesive sensitivities and haveyet to encounter a k tape i can wear for more than 24 hours  so there is that limitation but not an unexpected one  i use this on things like wrist strains and also to secure magnets to painful areas for magnet therapy  the peel off grid on the back of the tape makes it easier to estimate the amount needed for a task especially if you have taped the same area beforefor the newly initiated a general rule of thumb in taping a small area to secure it is to have one length of tape stretched 75 and the matching strap cut longer and unstretched like for a wrist  medium size areas like knees may require one unstretched and two stretched 50that sort of thing  never stretch both pairs 100  that may feel super supportive until it makes your skin peel a lesson learned from my previous roll of k tape  try to go to a pt or chiro for instructions
good product for a great price fits my electric toothbrush perfectly
i bought this as a foot rest under my desk at work i was a little disappointed  it is foam cushion so when i put my feet on it the foam slowly pushed down and it was no longer rising or bending my ankles like it should have  i wouldnt have minded it were slow to compress however it was a matter of seconds not minutes so it did no good at all for me as a foot rest  i wish it would have been less cushiony and soft but that didnt stop me from getting use out of it  i put it on my chair and use it as lumbar support  it works but sadly not for what i really wanted this for  its soft well made anti slip with grips on the bottom so cant complain too much but its no foot rest  sorry
if youre like me you read reviews before you purchase anything no one wants to waste their hardearned money thats why honest reviews matter good or bad so heres my thoughtspros lightweight quiet compared to my old clippers cuts smoothly  evenlycons absolutely none
this is a lifetime supply of nasal relief packets just add them to your neti pot with some distilled water and you are good to go they really help if you have a sinus infection or really bad allergies
these are great we are still cleaning after the fires here in california and these are non toxic and work great to remove the soot and ash damage thanks so much
i really like these  they are clear and large  they are a multipurpose bag for me storing comforters etc
great product will order this shake again
the upside is that unlike most magnesium pills these arent enormous and hard to swallow they are in standard size gel caps the downside is you need to take two to get less than the giant horse pills usually include i dont have a particularly difficult time swallowing large pills so its all pretty much the same to me these are good and so are the larger ones its all about what you prefer and how much you need
i bought this for a christmas gift to give to my mom she loves things like this i didnt actually read the description on it before purchasing so i was shocked at the size of it when i took it out of the box i was expecting a smaller item but im glad it is bigger than i expected because i think she will like it a lot more
average quality roller the stone is not particularly polished and looks as inexpensive as it is if youre in the market for a roller that just functions its fine but i can tell its one of those mass produced products that they sell in flea market stalls around town given that you can get nicer ones for the same price i wouldnt order this again sorry but not impressed
my husband loves the fact this handy little kit doesnt have to be plugged in  but instead uses a battery and does a fantastic job
these hold all my vitamins and are superb for traveling or at home  i like that i dont have to worry about the top popping open while traveling  no need for a zip lock bag or rubber band around the tops
my definition of attractive may be disputed but when i say that this is accurate i mean it the first thing i did after i unboxed the review sample that i received from the manufacturer was to test just how accurate it it a few notes i am not going to regurgitate the product description or specs on this page i will give my impression and highlights that led me to give this five stars also mine shipped with an included tape measure which was not mentioned in the description at the time of this review its actually a high quality one that has an autoretract mechanism that adds even more value to this seti test a lot of scales so i have standard weights that are used for calibration and in this case comparison my approach is to use different weights then repeat the weighing there was no deviation among the results from all testsin addition i also performed the same tests using a different scale and received the same results my conclusion is this is accurate per the product description right out of the boxyou can switch among pounds kilograms and stones by pressing a button on the underside of the scale plus this is accurate to one decimal place in 2 increments so you can see detailed results if you are battling the pounds or kilos or stones as well as weigh objectsa few things that i especially like about this scale are the large display which is a big deal at my age and the blue lit background i also like the fact that it will come alive as soon as i step on it and give me the bad or good news after a few second lag and will go back to sleep shortly after i step off of itamong the scales that i have tested this one stands out in ease of use display quality and accuracy its heavy and well made and the fifteen dollar price tag at the time of this review makes it an incredible bargain if you could see one in person youd be as impressed as i am
the bottom part of the mask just stays open and is really not keeping your germs in or any other germs out
i could not get this guard to work  i boiled it a second time when i got it too tight the first time and it still didnt work  it was not cheap either
cant feel pain on bum
this product absolutely destroyed my sensitive areas i cant believe this product is marketed for babies id never ever put a baby through what this did to me chemical burns completely destroyed me almost went to the er do not buy
i like the sturdiness of these insoles yes they are very hard and hard to cut but if you want a firm supportive insole they have to be firm they give me the best support in my foot wear yes it took a long time to trim them down to size but the feel and comfort they provide is worth it this is not a flabby insole which would be a waste of money and until i found these ive been wasting lots of money these insoles are quality made and i will certainly purchase another for my boots these insoles come all the way to the toe giving full support
the quality of the bags is very poor the seams rip open the second you put anything in themif they were sturdier they would get 5 stars for their overall holiday charm
we ordered a 3 pack of these glasses  the first pair lasted a week the 2nd pair lasted two weeks and the 3rd pair lasted 2 minutes  the arms easily unscrew and either we cant find the parts or we would need to buy a repair kit
great for in house and travel bags
nope huge nope on this stuff it smells horrible and the taste is just as bad as the smell i made the mistake of trying another flavor and it had the same horrible rancid vitamin smell as this one and i can tell you right now i didnt feel like getting sick from this stuff either just stay away from this stuff unless you like the rancid vitamin taste
cleans body and hair easily and thoroughly smells almost as nice as almonds some may need hair conditioner after shower
feels exactly the same as my noninnovative curler with the noninnovative replacement rubber part it bent my lashes just like the other does
pretty much useless i got it for cats theyre freaks to begin with and have to be on prozac so i bought this anticipating trouble this was not helpful as an alternative i also purchased those treat things that you shove the pill in and although they needed some coaxing  praise the cats now gobble their pills eagerly every day success
this little water bottle is the right size for me i bought it for use at the office its small size makes storing it easy since i have limited space at my cubicle its small size makes it more discreet than a fullsize water bottle the bottle is also small enough that i can slip my shirt over it for even more discreetness and its small enough to easily be filled up using the hot water dispenser at my offices coffee maker i only need a little bit of warmth in small areas for example the small of my back it seems to hold heat longer than a fabric tube with dried rice inside it and once you have it positioned nicely it isnt a struggle to keep it in placei also use the hot water dispenser at my works coffee maker to fill it up so it only takes 30 seconds to fill up my mini water bottle instead of three minutes heating up a tube full of rice in the microwave
awful taste chalky doesnt dissolve
wife wears all the time
i have been taking suppliments for 40 years and have finally found an affordable multi that is great  i am a loyal user and will be until i go toes up  i am healthy even though my eating habits have not always been the best and i attribute this to my vitalert

its ok its a little rough for my scalp
this little guy saved me from having to buy a new microwave the handle broke off of it and my gums and found this cool gadget and its worked great i was a bit apprehensive but to my surprise did the trick thank goodness highly recommended
this item was purchased to help dispense the liquid hand cleaner from the bottle  it makes just the right amount for washing without wasteful over supply  makes financial help with dispensing of the hibiclens just the right amount  good to have if you use hibiclens in your home
i am really excited to find a nonfish source of omega 3s and in a gelatinfree gummy too as a vegetarian this is a huge discovery i am bewildered at the reviewers who mention anything about a fishy taste or smell this is an entirely plantbased product it tastes like a fruity gummy vitamin the only thing i would change is the quantity in the bottle this may not make a difference to many consumers but i bought this in conjunction with another wow supplement this bottle contains 30 servings while the other product contains 50 servings it would be far more convenient if the products contained the same number of servings so they are on the same refill schedule otherwise im very enthusiastic about this new supplement discovery i did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review
comfortable socks
when they stayed in place they worked good i used them with a more open toe perhaps they work better in a closed shoewhen i could get them to stay in place the comfort was good and i didnt mind the toe thing at least it didnt bother they just dont work for any flat that is open
overall this is an okay toothpaste not the best not the worst and overpriced for what it claims and fails to do ive been using it for several weeks and havent noticed any significant improvement in my oral health tartar levels or whiteness its minty and on the thinner side its not meant to foam but i feel i need more than average amounts to properly brush my teeth my teeth feel clean but not moreso than they do with other toothpastes ill stick with the periogen mouth rinse
b vitamins are needed when you are on a vegetarian diet or when you are just stressed out by lifes challenges these easytouse tubes are portable and travel well they save you from having to swallow more pills these are pleasantly strawberry flavored and provide b3 b6 b7 b9 and b12 the other ingredients include distilled water vegetable glycerin citric acid potassium sorbate and natural flavorings they taste great to your healthplease consult with a doctor before taking supplements personally these make me feel calmer and less anxiousthe rebecca review
light weight easy to use but doesnt do anything for me followed instructions and no curling actually occurs  i would return it but i lost the batter compartment cover it wouldnt stay on i wouldnt recommend perhaps my lashes are too thick
does a fantastic job used cascade for 3 years worth every penny
okay im just going to say it i dont brush my teeth enough ive got a nice soniccare electric toothbrush in the bathroom but because im retired and dont have to get dressed up to go out anywhere i dont have a grooming routine i dont have an alarm clock either i needed something like this to keep close to me to help me remember to use it so when i was offered the product at a discount in exchange for my honest review i was pretty happy about being able to try itim sure im not the only senior who wears comfortable clothes and falls asleep in them if my clothes are not dirty ive been known to wear them for days at a time im probably also not the only senior who doesnt register what day or time it is half the time i keep my hair cut very short so if i forget to comb it nobody will notice i work on my computer almost every waking moment and it seems the only time i get out from under that cloud is when im in the kitchen cooking its only when im waiting for the microwave to finish or the coffee pot to stop perking that i suddenly become aware of my bodyat which point i usually realize i need to brush my teethive tried keeping a spare manual toothbrush and toothpaste in the kitchen both have a tendency to fall into the sink with the dirty dishes i like this brush because i can clip it to my t shirt or pocket where it looks like some kind of space pen and whip it out for a quick brushing while im waiting for the microwave to finish i love how you can quotdialquot out just a little toothpaste not so much as to require a lot of water do a quick brushing then rinse at the sink stick the brush back into its cap and get back to what you were doingmy toms of maine toothpaste tube wasnt a perfect fit for the screwon end through which you fill it but it was good enough i just turned the dial down as the tube filled with toothpaste dialing it back up with the thumbscrew pushes the toothpaste up through the center of the brush it doesnt take much i dont know what people are talking about with quotcleaningquot it i wouldnt bother with that i think as long as you rinse the brush end well and dial a tiny bit of toothpaste back into the bristles like flushing a syringe theres no reason to have to clean the toothpaste reservoir just put more toothpaste into it when its getting low i would thinkdisclaimer i came of age at a time when kids actually played in the dirt and exposure to germs was considered a good way of building up immunity if youre one of those people who showers three times a day and has to clean everything to within an inch of its life all the time you probably wont like this toothbrush
love it holds a ton of pennies may not be the most ideal if you plan on taking it with you as you travel it is quite large but it displays beautifully at home
look great crisp vision definitely improves driving night vision sturdy buildbetter look than expected
i have been using this product for a couple of years  works well without side affects
doesnt seem to be as good quality as the higher priced brands ive tried but i guess you get what you pay foror dont
i use superfood supplements all the time frankly i think that is the only reason that i have yet to have the flu or any major illness in years i take these which are good for the gut
purchased as game give aways for a baby shower
ive recently discovered the wonders of gel manicures no drying time and they last for weeks sign me up i love the colors included in this set they are very vibrant and bright the colors go on fairly thin so it takes a couple of coats to get good coverage the glitter polish is a bit on the chunky side which is pretty but rather hard to get it to look even the polish arrived nicely packaged in a box with foam to hold it in place and a color dot on top of each bottle to quickly identify the colors since gel polish arrives in black bottles im happy with it so far and would order this again
its expensive but it works definitely going to keep buying
didnt work for me at all returned
i was a little nervous ordering these because some reviewers noted they are small  for the price i decided to give them a try and if they were too small my teen daughter could wear them  glad i ordered because they fit great  the seam down the center also helps prevent breathing in your mask while talking and breathing  i wish i ordered these sooner
for when you really need to blow your schnozz
i wasnt expecting a whole lot from these clippers given the price point ten bucks as of this review i was really surprised at how well these work the blades cut as well as models costing far more a nice clean cut without any pulling or abrasion the length dial works very well it has a nice smooth action with a solid positive click stop for each length it comes with two guides so you have two sets of adjustability lengthswhere the costcutting is seen is with the case and attachment build quality its all plastic and doesnt have much of a solid heft to it i very much doubt this would survive a fall of a few feet onto a hard floor im not willing to test that out so i may be wrong about that but the very plasticy nature of the clippers dont make me at all confident in their ability to shrug off damage the guide combs are also rather thin but since they connect to the body with an internal peg versus having to pull them off the blade itself the thinner build quality is fine with regard to durabilityit charges with a usb c cable included which is a nice change from having to keep and use a transformer specifically for the clipper  the motor has a muted buzz that is reasonably quiet and not annoying theres only one control which is a sliding onoff it clicks firmly into place and stays put in usewhile these are lightweight in terms of build quality it punches well above its weight class when it comes to performance five stars
perfect for my kitchen keeps those odors away
this is my 4th reorder
omg   amazing this is the best purchase ever  works 100
i feel i got what i paid for at 762 i was not expecting anything too terribly great but i put it on and after less than 6 hours of wearing noticed the elastic has already stretched and is gone i was hoping to get at least a weeks use out of each bandage but doubt i will get that
i love the chance to try different items thanks
it is pricey compared to other older eating sprays but thats because it is what youd expect for that higher price i really appreciate that quality
it is not a good mask  it is not waterproof  it is very thin material  not recommended to buyers
as someone with sensory issues and needing motivation to clean anyway these gloves worked well pacific ppes 2pack of household gloves are unlined and a bit thin and this pair was sized large they ran very large particularly for my medium handsthey were perfect for bathroom cleaning they are quite long and came above my hoodie sleeves enough to protect them but also so that i didnt have to worry about pushing my sleeves up my gripe about most gloves is they arent long enough so fluids get into them anyway didnt happen at all with these gloves they were protective from cleaning chemicals and waterthey are quite thin so i wonder how long before one tears likewise not knowing much about this material i wonder if they will  become brittle over time particularly from chemical contactin all they are great gloves and worth every dime
bitter bitter bitter i still drank it in different ways hot cold in different rooms lol  i did not receive a relaxed feeling i do not foresee me purchasing this product again
work great on muscle cramps and sore muscles
it is a very good concept that could work for adults that work at a desk with their water bottle next to them but even though they need to be vigilant as the device only blinks once  and if they miss it and do not drink the device eventually shut down i think it should be refined at least with repeated blinking when the first blink is missed  or perhaps it should be a warning bip sound instead of the first blink followed by repeated blinking after a while if the is missedthis does not  work for children
thank you for the speedy delivery and most importantly a product that i can use i will for sure be ordering more of these in the future and through you guys
this perfect my eyeglasses my earrings pills and loose chains
it tasted good but was quite expensive
best thing ive bought in a very long time
heat humidity a blazing sun and salty air create an environment where a great pair of sunglasses are mandatory when enjoying the great outdoors  unfortunately most sunglass holders are made of cloth and therefore absorb moisture and turn into wet noodles  they also start to smell and the color fades  i bought my first set of cablz when i saw them on a fishing guide and realized how perfect they were for this environment  now all of my family uses them couldnt be happier
works as intended but may have a tendency to shift after closing causing the case to close at an angle
this is not a durable item the stone is very light and left me surprised how quickly it dissolvesdo yourself a favor and listen to the reviews here i ignored them and now im stuck with a product thats marginal at bestthe maker really needs to reformulate or look for another material that offers consumers a more durable experience
they are nice looking and do not look like 34old lady socks34  i am in my 40s and had sclerotherapy done and wanted support after i got done wearing the ones the dr had me use but i didnt want ugly socks or socks that made my feet get too hot with my tennis shoes  they stay up and make my legs feel better when i wear them
i chose the sweet over the savory based upon the vegetables i like more but i didnt care for the taste of this  it changed the flavor of any food i added it to so its still sitting on my counter over a month later
the value for the money is very good though the freshness not as intense as i would like maybe because marjoram is not as strong as oregano ive had some good experience with this company and will purchase from them again
and it really needed a squeeze bottle so that you can cleanse your bits and pieces off this works wonderfully when i am all done i can dry everything or let everything air dry for the next use if you have hemorrhoids this will help you alot
this stuff cleans and lubricates keeps your shaver like new
i mainly wanted this for pcos hormonal acne i started taking progesterone and metformin in early march and they both had my face looking like i was a teenager again it was extremely embarrassing for me since im 40 years old after about a month of taking these my skin started to improve a lot i am still breaking out here and there but its only like once or twice a week if that compared to every single daythe flavor is this supplement is tolerable it has a slight tartness at first and then a bite at the end from the pepper it can burn your throat a little but ive gotten used to it so it doesnt bother me
ive used one box for a gift so far i think i need to superglue to fabric onto the box as i arrive to the pary with the box i notice part of the box coming apart
the thing does not work and looked like it had been opened before we revived it  what a joke this product seems to be
have a 35 lb dog that loves chewing  he struggled with the large chewing part and so settled on the foot pads and chewed them off leaving the rest  seemed a bit difficult for him to get a good chomp on  otherwise he was very interested in trying to tear the thing apart
nitropics  is a quality brand compounding interesting ingredient supplements nitropics supplements attract topnotch user reviews  maybe the best in the supplement market if nitropics makes it its worth a tryhigh expectations so far so good it will be better than i expected
works well for a bargain price thing is its less gooey than the name brand but as the title says it does the job i needed it to do i use quite a bit of the stuff for medical reasons and am happy i can go to amazon for the connection
i liked the extra suction cup hook and rubber scrubber that came with the box you get a charcoal green tea and normal sponge ive used the charcoal one so far and you dont have to worry about the color robbing off or leaving lumps of charcoal on your face the charcoal has no smell or feeling i would go as far as to say the added charcoal is cosmetic the sponges are very soft and slightly slippery like  how bleach feels and it cleans the face i cant say this is a musthave product but it is a good product for people who dont have anything to wash their face with but water the sponge will help exfoliate the skin without any exfoliates so its natural and safe for all kinds of skin you can use it with or without soap i dont see any noticeable difference with using the sponge vs using the washcloth but it is a much gentler substitute for washcloths if you are in the market for something gentler for your skin
i started using clear tract powder about 6 months ago i have a 20 year history of bladder infections and the antibiotics werent cutting it anymore i havent had one since using clear tract works best on gramnegative bacteria such as ecoli if you have grampositive bacteria which i also had oil of oregano works like a charm on those types of bladder infections i developed a staph grampositive bladder infection months ago and it was resistant to antibiotics the only thing that cured it was oil of oregano ill never take antibiotics again unless its a lifeordeath situationbetween clear tract oil of oregano krill oil supplements and probiotics in addition to really improving my diet i havent had an infection since actually i havent been sick at all since either my daughter currently has the flu with vomiting and diarrhea but i feel great try clear tractit really works
this dr mercola organic white grapefruit essential oil has a nice fresh aroma it will be great for making blends to go in my diffusers i have a pink grapefruit essential oil already and was hoping this one would be a little different but they smell pretty much the same though it smells good on its own there are many blends using grapefruit that smell so good and i look forward to trying lots of themit does seem to have a lighter scent than im used to so i would not trust using it in any skin or lip recipes for diffusing and candle making i would definitely recommend it
traumeel is the best homeopathic cream made anywhere  it speeds up healing of all my bruises surgical dressings etc  i use it to excellent effect  helping with healing after surgeries and injuries
overall it works as described however we quickly found that it is noisy when plugged in the remote section of the cord makes a high pitch noise along with a deep clanging noise
love this stuff it takes a really good stir once you first open it up but is so tasty and love the added protein
love this lemon juice will use it forever
if i could give it a negative star i would  i ignored the negative reviews because i wanted to believe i would like it some people do  it is sweetened with maltitol which spikes my blood sugar maltitol syrup has a glycemic index of 52 which approaches that of table sugar at 60  i prefer erythritol or stevia  the listing on the website did not show the ingredients it just stated 34no added sugar34  i should have been cautious when ingredients were not listed  even worse they have a 34no return34 policy
taste is great i mix it with ultima replenisher electroyte drink for when i play golf and sweat alot  keeps up my engery
wow no first of all first time i tried to use it i slid off my chair and hit the ground later when i kept trying to find a way to use it it left deep deep gouge marks in my skin def a waste and painful bizarrely painful
great for wedding favors we used these to put together smore wedding favors and they turned out very well
more delicious than a lip gloss warming and tingly you may find interesting uses for this edible massage oil you can use it as a massage oil although it is slightly more sticky and sweet it warms slightly on the skin but mostly when tasted surprise the one you love with a chocolate kiss by using this as a lip gloss the oil looks like a cherry gloss vanilla syrup and comes in a corked glass bottle youd imagine finding on the beach when empty you can refill with regular massage oils i can almost guarantee if you try this flavor you will want to try the rest i thought the flavor was rather sweet minty and deliciousthe rebecca review
i am giving this three stars only because i love the colors and the variety of them i really needed the piece on the back of the heel because the shoes fit me a tad big but unfortanely i followed the steps on how to apply the cushion and it didnt last at all it came right off and keep rolling under my heel very umcomfortable they were working just fine when i tried it on and left it but when it was time to wear it for longer period it did not work as i expected i tried the beige cushion that goes behind the heel with a nude heel you couldnt see the cushion which was good
smooth  right size
perfect size great to travel with works well
this roll on smells like menthol and goes on icy cold i get a cooling soothing sensation for about 1520 mins then nada its nice to use after a workout or long day so its been great for me but you will need to constantly reapply for lingering aches
i love this toothbrush it comes with replacement heads so this will last a while before needing to buy more replacement heads amazing price last a long time so many different modes its easy to get the perfect brush with no issues
i love many of life extensions products and i take two fairly regularly i need to be cost conscious  its possible that i dont need nitrovasc but i noticed nothing over the month or so that i was taking this
as advertised good product good vendor
great mask no filter thoughbut still great mask
was looking for something different for cleaning toliet easy to use good value for the money
do not buy this do not buy this do not buy this the product does not work very well it is overhyped the battery lasts but a few minutes when they say that it lasts almost an hour it is a piece of junk add hardly worth what theyre asking i would highly consider using something else cuz this is certainly not something you want to spend your money on nor is it even that pleasurable
ive bought a ton of different cotton since i started vaping from overpriced mavaton and egyptian cotton cool whic american grown cotton fire bolt cotton bacon and more this cotton here beats them all its super absorbent and high quality ive never been more happy with a cotton before not to mention you get 13 feet of it in this package ive already rewicked 5 different builds and gave my buddy a big chunk of it to try and it doesnt look like ive even touched this package yet you cant go wrong buying this
9 of mine were christmas rollsand 4 of those rolls were duplicates
honestly i dont know what my autistic son would do without these
this is so cute travel sized yet it gets the job done it comes with its own insulated pouch and a gift box great gift idea
dont think i actually need this  wanted it but i notice i hardly use it quality is great though
helps these dry  funky eyes  pricey but worth it for me
too thick and large
the arm stand is definitely not sturdy and should not be relied on
this machine gave fast reading not sure if the accuracy for the most part though very compact and easy to carry
johnson  johnson always deliver quality while knock off breads dont the swab never falls off the stick like they do with other brands every time i dont buy jj im disappointed every time i do im satisfied
sadly my trusted electronic tooth brush finally gave up so it was time to replace it so i decided this one would work and it works just as well as my old one did it has the same settings with 30 second intervals for the different areas reminding me with a buzz that it is time to move to the next areait charges with usbc which is great so no more extra cables when i travel now i can consolidate and use the same cables for phone and tooth brush which is amazing i feel that it cleanse my teeth quite well and have no complaints the charge lasts significantly longer than it did on my old brush amazing how much further tech got since i bought the old one
there was no curve to this eyelash curler and didnt grip eyelashes would not recommend
didnt even cut the hair very poor quality
this ointment really helped to relieve my headachemuscle pain quickly i mixed it with bay rum alcoholado this is my 3rd order because it works for me
terrific quality just as described and promptly delivered
i decided to give this product a try alongside my order of aeroshot energy and based on the reviews from this product i was actually pretty excited to get the mintyfreshbreath spray combined with the energy boost i even bought twoepic fail yes this product will give you a minty blast of breath spray that will temporarily last however the energy level that i received after even overusingoverspraying resulted in no more energy than i would have expected i felt nothing but fresh tasting breath and clearedup airwaysi would definitely say save your money and pass on this primer peppermint energy breath spray stick with altoidsnote see my review on aeroshot energy for a product that actually works
this product is sweetened but not flavored so it just tastes like faintly salty from the electrolytes sugar water but not watermelon grape orange mixed fruit etc i doubt dogs would mind the sweetness added to their food and cats do not taste sweet well if at all i have been using this to great effect with my picky eater elderly cat who has inflammatory bowel disease ibd with chronic diarrhea i just add some of this to whatever hes having i firmly believe feeding him raw meatboneorgan has kept him alive since his brother died of the same condition before i discovered raw feeding i also add ground psyllium husk to help solidify his poop anyway i highly recommend for rehydrating sick or chronically dehydrated pets
great stones for the price these arent as big or smooth as others i have but for the price i cant complain i was surprised that these didnt come with a list of what stones are included since it sounds like they arent the same with each order i know what most of them are but i have no idea what the others are
these tablets seem to work very well i have an older washer and sometimes it gets a musty smell after so many uses it was easy to use these you just dropped the fizzy tablets in and let the washer agitate then you stop the washer and let the tablets do their thing for a couple hours then you turn it on rinse and youre done my washer smells a lot better and looked a lot cleaner after using them
they didnt stay suck on shoes  lasted about 5 min
i have been working on lowering my bp for over a yr  did not want to take scripts for it  been following natural remedies and a friend suggested this as the amish use it  finally today my bp broke  into the 120s  129 over 79 to be exact  usually ran in the 190s over 90sso i am thrilled  will be re ordering this
this is an easy switch to make both for the planet and for your wallet i have had a set of dryer balls a different brand for 3 years and they are still going strong these dont feel like they are wrapped quite as tightly as my old set but i fully expect them to last over a year they dont leave any fuzz behind on my clothes and they dont have any weird chemicals this is a very affordable option to substitute for dryer sheets
really like these glucose tablets they taste good and they increase my sugar pretty fast
the bags hold scraps of food well but they are a bit thin they are also smaller than i expected i cant fit them around the top edge of the trash bin that pulls out from one of my kitchen cupboards however i really like the biodegradable factor and i am figuring out ways to use them anyway
good value for price
perfect for traveling or for home
i installed it in my kitchen and when i leave a pile of dishes overnight the difference in odor is night and day
i love this scent perfumey and potent i barely use any of these in the wash and they do the trick the scent is strong so you dont need much it dont really know what to compare the smell to other than it smells like a feminine perfume floral but with a bright citrus note too on clothing its very mild but if you are washing a picky males laundry you might want to try something more herbal my husband doesnt care one way or the other so this is fine for usi know fabric softenersscent boostersadded stuff are not that great for fabrics but i like my laundry to smell clean i respond to scent and i have found that i enjoy doing laundry much more if i have nicely scented things to usei was using purex crystals but the packaging is deceptive its only about 34 of the way full i also have to use more in order to get the benefit of the scent the downy packaging is a bit better and i do the tiniest sprinkle one bottle lasts a long timethey open easily i guess so people can try the scent before purchasing and people can steal right from the bottle i have found halfempty bottles on the shelf before a friend of mine works in a department store and she says people will dump the entire contents into a ziploc bag and walk out with it so be sure to check your bottles when you make a purchase its easy to just grab a bottle thinking its full and get home to find that some is missing especially if youre a distracted mom and are in a hurry to get home before your child has an instore meltdowni now make my own laundry detergent and i use these in one of my batches i make a softeneradded stuff free batch too for towels and i am very happy with it only one step and no measuring when its time to wash the recipe i use is from a blog called aprons n pearls and the post is called homemade laundry soap if you want to google it i found it on pinterest it uses washing soda borax fels naptha and other ingredients plus these you only need a couplefew tablespoons per laundry load so one batch lasts a looong time it takes about 2030 mins to make iti purchased this through prime pantry and it was 699 with a 200 coupon which is still a little bit more than what id pay in my grocery store but i needed a new bottle before i would have a chance to run to the store i paid extra for the delivery but in store this is much less expensive especially if you can find a coupon
color is nice and pattern is esthetic but the paper stock is thinner than other brands and feels a little cheap you get what you pay for at least in this case
these stainless steel roller balls leak bad it literally drips from the ball horrible
these are very good smelling and lasted longer than expected the colors are very bright and each tablet is individual wrapped in plastic they do list the ingredients and are not all natural but they never claim to be check the ingredient list before purchasing if you have any skin sensitivities they come in a nice box that is a great gift
i am very happy with the product and the seller services  i have used this vitac serum mixed with my clinique moisturizer for several years  it is great to see it available on amazon with quick shipping thank you
i was afraid this would be difficult to work with but its flavorless and dissolves well  it doesnt come with its own scoop which is a big downfall in my book  i have to commandeer scoops from my protein powder containers  im not sure that ive actually seen a difference in my skin since beginning to use it though  the container is fairly small for the higher price tag on it
id never even heard of white noise machines before i became a parent and now im practically a white noise hoarder i have one in each of my kids rooms a portable one for travel and one that gets left at grandmas house in case i forget mine plus a couple extras you know in case one breaks its bad i have a problem but theyre just so stinkin soothing and they cover every squeak of the floor in my 100 year old house so i can sneak into my sleeping kids rooms without waking them up of all the white noise machines ive had this one has the least annoying bonus sounds of all of them i usually just use the various white noise settings but on this one the nature sounds and music are actually really nice im impressed i wish there was a way to have it rotate through all the songs instead of play twinkle twinkle little star 500 times in a row but other than that theres really nothing about this that i dont like the light is soft and you can select the color of light you prefer or have it fade through the whole rainbow a rechargeable battery would really knock this out of the park so i could have the option to use it without being plugged in but its not something i really need i guess i would definitely recommend this to any new parent
my wife liked them ok
after the birth of my two year old i am finding that my upper back is hurting more and more my physical therapist suggested i get a posture corrector to straighten and relieve pain this one is a great choice unlike other ones i have that didnt help this one has a wide strip of stretchy fabric between the shoulder blades that fits more comfortable but still helps to align my back in place and ease pain this one can be fastened in the front for easier ability to put on and take off its really comfortable and soft great value
i am beyond upset with this order there are four sets of metatarsal pads in this box but three of the pairs are for the right foot only see photo and one pair has a left and right pad see photo in itthese are difficult to insert into a shoe because the back is very sticky this means the first placement has to be final i was able to insert one pair into my shoes and they offer some comfort i would have rated this four or five stars if they shipped actual pairs and not pairs for people who have two right feetthis is another product going in the garbage because they are not usable as is
this purchase was just fine
i like it usually i throw half a banana ice and some ovaltine with it just depending on how hungry i am i do two scoops which i think comes to less than 2 dollars a meal use it for breakfast and sometimes dinner toopro tip save the scoop from the previous purchase because sometimes the measuring scoop gets buried at the bottom from shipping
good for removal of the oldest blackheads on soft skin does not work well on thicker skin
mistakenly i gave this item a 3 starit doesnt deserve 1 starno matter what guard i put on the blade it doesnt give an even cut you can actually see the uneveness of the blade it only served its purpose during an emergency with the pandemic virus we are all under because my girl was getting matted however a groomer told me when he saw it  its the worse razor to use on pets  redirecting me to different ones
best socks ever warm loose no slip i dont wear anything else love these

i am always looking to make regular meals healthier i like to replace rice with cauliflower rice replace white sugar with stevia and use beans where ever i can i used this sugar to replace half the sugar in a healthier homemade brownie pie recipe i have tweaked with the main ingredient being low sodium canned great northern beans for all of you skeptics out there dont knock it until you try it this recipe is one i found online however i have tweaked the ingredients and trust me it will blow you socks offingredients2 cans low sodium northern beans13 cup cocoa powder23 cup quick oats keep whole or blend into a flour14 cup applesauce12 tap salt1 tbsp vanilla extract1 cups sugar half whitehalf agave insulin powder1 cup chocolate chips half milkhalf darkoil is to drizzle in any oil works grapeseed olive avocado vegetableadd all ingredients into a food processor and then on low while on slowly drizzle the oil into the food processor until the mixture is smooth then add in chocolate chips and then on high for a few minutes until everything is incorporated into a batter pour into a pregreased 8 inch circle pan cook for 25 minutes  and then left cool in the refrigerator for 4 hours slice and serve it is best served warmed up with vanilla ice cream
i wasnt sure what to think about this but i saw an infomercial and had to give it a try ive been wearing glasses for over 20 years and never thought about needing to stop my glasses from slipping off my nose because i usually buy well fitting glasses however after trying this i realize that i move my glasses back up my nose all the time with this nerdwax i was finding myself trying to move my glasses back up my nose and realizing they were still in the same place there is a slight smell of peppermint when you first put it on but it is pleasant and it does not bother my skin or my nose with the scent i forgot to put it on one day when i went into work and i was actually disappointed in myself which is i guess a good way to figure out that this product actually works and i truly enjoy it great job
you get a jar of solid soap for use on painting brushes they suggest using this for oil watercolor and acrylic paintbrushes that need cleaning you unscrew the top and rub the wet dirty brush against the soap to work the soap into the brush obviously you then rinse the brushes it seems to work fine and seems comparable to the brush soap that i currently use i allow the soap to dry out before screwing the cap back on
nice finishing touch for small boxes
not too hot supportive medium stretch and compression
i get this every year to keep everyones immune system up
whoever invented this has given a gift to all caregivers i have a 41 year old son who is like a 3 month old and with these i can diaper him even though i have many health problems of my own if you are a caregiver to an adult this is a must have

discounted or free itemis it good or badill make the providerauthoreither happy or sadand sometimes even madone of my earliest memories is going with my father to visit grandpa  the reason that i remember those trips so vividly is that dad would always take an electric drill with us on those visits  it turned out that the purpose of those visits was to grind down grandpas thick toenails  i was still too young to understand that the human body often provides us with some surprises but now ive developed a few of those thick toenails myself  in addition it appears that grandpa is responsible for my thick nasal hair and fastgrowing long hairs that grow both inside my ears and on my ear lobes  three cheers for grandpafortunately most of my toenails are normal and dont require extra attention but up until now it was a real project to keep the affected ones trimmed and under control  previously i was somewhat successful using a special set of heavy duty clippers that have long handles for leverage but the results were often raggedy and unattractive  so being offered this set of clippers for testing and review was a welcome and timely circumstance  these beautyme nail  toenail clippers appear to be extremely wellmade and durable  the handles are long and ergonomic and the blades are curved and extremely sharp  the vendor describes these as 34premium qualitysurgical grade and i have no reason to doubt themthe combination of the long handles for leverage strong spring for strength and extremely sharp curved blades makes for an effective and precise set of clippers  they work like a charm on my thick toenails  the one caution i will give you is to be extremely careful to avoid having the blades cut your skin when using them  toes tend to be very sensitive and bleed quite a bitnote  if you hit the 34more34 button under 34about the product34 on the amazon product page you will see two erroneous references to their blackhead remover kit  perhaps the company should review and change that verbage

bought for my mini pig dewey helps his skin and coat stay soft and shiny
i have nothing bad to say about the product in fact in my opinion  this is one of their nicest scents especially if youre already fond of lavender  im disappointed in myself however for not reading carefully and realizing this ridiculously gouged price is for just one bottle  wont happen again thats for sure _ツ_
exactly as advertised and fits perfectly also fits my merkur 34c razor a bit short but fine expensive considering the low cost of the razor
hubby adds this to his daily smoothie of avocado banana  kale  this power has very little flavor so its a great supplement without ruining the taste of the smoothie
love thisget one
for such a lightweight low cost chair i was surprised how well made it is and how nice the fabric is as to comfort well if youre a big guy like me sitting in the chair for any length of time the armrests will start to dig into your legs and get a bit uncomfortable it also sits a little lower to the ground than i would prefer my wife and kids however love the chair and think it is very comfortable
a must have for any first aid kit
nicely packaged and handy to carry
this allows you to gently touch your skin while not rubbing hard on it this bottle should last a lifetime

this just plain didnt work didnt spin didnt clean

wife loves it
one side has floral covering not shown in photo china post shipping was slow
ive been wearing contact lenses since 1973  this product works better than anything ive ever tried particularly when your lenses are grimy from pollution and irritants  the generics are fine but the alcon brand is really the best
too hot  despite what ad says  burned eye lids  did not curl or straighten lashes
because i cannot take such large capsules i have to open them up and mix with juice this tastes pretty good compared to most so far so good
i bought the white color since its the cheapestthe masks are soft and comfortable  they fit my wifes face much better than all the other masks she tried the other masks were always a little larger for herthe only reservation i have is these masks only have 2 plies  but then given how cheap the white ones are i can always double up
fine and easy to use
i absolutely love this product the smell is so nice and i like the fact that its all natural oils and no harmful chemicals will be purchasing again soon
it works it was fun and informative to see which waters were alkaline
love it  cant get enough licorice
i love this product
i use this in banana and almond milk smoothies  it adds a nice color  the taste isnt overpowering but if you dont like beets you probably wont like this  the packaging is good but on occasion i do find that the power gets stuck in the zip closures if that happens i just transfer it all to a glass jar
product does what it is suppose to do however for some reason i kept thinking it was made from silicon not a huge deal just though that
we used these for our wedding cute little bags there were a few broken but for the price not bad
i have a significant problem with arthritis thanks mom and i needed a good sized heating pad for my knees after mumtiple surgeries on my knees shoulder elbow and thumb joints i go through a lot of cold and heat product and ive used this one every day for two months without a problem some of the electric heat pads ive purchased died within 90 daysi dont rate products easily and i save 5 stars for truly outstanding purchaeee this was a solid 4
i love this sunblock we used it for 4 hours atin the lake  no sunburn on my 5 year old or i  i usually use organic expensive sunscreens for him but i forgot them and this is all i had  it worked great
lid piece was cracked the first time we used it returning maybe we got a dud but lid appears to be cheaply made
i wish i liked the taste better they are tolerable  and i am not sure how well they work as i have only been taking them a short time
did work for me i cannot wear backpacks because they hurt my shoulders and this was like wearing a backpack very uncomfortable for me
i couldnt get this device to stay put in the toe box of my shoe once it was inserted and expanded  and so it was  not useful at all  am returning it  also  after having read other reviews which suggested this device may be too big for some shoes i even ordered a size smaller than indicated by my shoe size even so it was impossible to jam it all the way into the toe box and then when it was expanded it slipped out even fartherits a design flaw  if it had an adjustable wood block on the other end of the threaded bolt that could be used as an abutment against the back of the shoe and it would keep the device in place with that design change  i think this device would work well but as its currently designed i found it useless
works great seems sturdy love the bristle cover
it does what it says  good cleaning action and rinses well
i love this thing i sleep on it every night
the pads on this are stiff where they dont form around my neck as it shouldhave to pull the handles to get enough pressure on what it can press uponmassaging on what i can feel are okay
i didnt like these the top band hit in the wrong place on my lower leg which made these incredibly uncomfortable i purchased a medium and wear a size 758 i think the chart was accurate with the size recommendation also these arent a good long term sock theyre not going to hold up well if you wear them daily and wash them often these are prone to snagging and tearing i bought to wear in bed while i sleep so i wasnt hard on my pair at all
all right these are rather pricey for only 14 days worth of probiotics hence the not perfect review but then again you should only need them when you have some sort of stomach upsettake antibioticsspecial circumstances overcoming a nasty case of bronchitis i decided to give these a try when i came off the meds they seemed to work theyre easy to swallow and they dont need to be put in the fridge but keep from extreme heat
tried another brand once but find this is the very best on the market
this eye mask is great the package comes ready to be given as a nice gift with the box and paper the mask itself blocks out any and all light the plush cushion provides enough room for you to be able to open your eyes even without being squished the strap is what makes it for me its adjustable and flush so its not being tangled up in your hair or pulling it out
great taste
usable inexpensive readers that dont cost 24 like the ones at wholefoods great value for 5 bucksupdate my rating dropped by 2 stars due to the tripling of the cost to 15 bucks in a year

this make up brush is so dissappointing good quality makeup brushes are not hard to find but the kind that retract seem to be few and far between i was so glad to find this little brush because i travel a lot and have trouble keeping my make up brushes cleanas soon as i opened the package the lids fell off they are so loose that it is no use even trying to use these brushes for their intended purpose i tried crimping the lids a little so they would grip but it was no use they simply do not fit well wont stay on and that is all there is to it this is not a fluke because i also ordered the retractable blush brush made by the same company and it has the same problemthe actual brushes are not my favorite and this little eye shadow brush has made its way to the bottom of my make up drawer to languish for a respectable amount of time till i decide to face that i will never use this  even if i liked the brush no matter how good the brushes are if the lids dont stay on the whole purpose of a retractable brush is defeatedanother weird thing is that the seller was supposed to be a company called books from boulder the package came from target i could have just driven to my neighborhood target store and bought these without paying the shipping very strange
this would be adorable for a babys room  my living room not so much  going to save it foe the next baby shower
it looks nice thinner than i expected i like the option of using kg instead of lb
this is smaller than i expected but works nicely it did have some weird discoloration on them but didnt seem to cause any alarms
i really like these bars  they are balanced well and low in calories i can keep one in my purchase and if i cant eat a meal this works as a replacement
i bought these for my nieces  nephews to have fun with since i enjoyed them in the 70s  the kids love them
me and my bf were curious what our blood types were so i order two theyre a really good price imo im a baby with needles but the one used in the kit isnt bad just a quick prick and you have your results right away after we got our results weve been making sure to donate blood as much as possible good kit for
these are really well put together they have three individual pockets inside and hold a standard capsule
ive been using collagen powder for a few months now and have noticed some real changes the biggest being with my digestive system ive suffered from stomach issues on a daily basis for years due to colitis and adhesions collagen powder supplements are really doing wonders for my tummy so that i dont have so much pain they just seem to make things so healthy in therethis colageno hidrolizado en polvo peptides collagen powder mixes very easily into my coffee and my overnight oats i cannot taste it at all in either one and it doesnt have or leave a nasty powder or grainy texture in the last half of my coffee i cant even tell its in therethis collagen powder comes in an xl large plastic container that is barely half filled with this wonderful supplement it is such a waste to have to throw out so much more plastic than necessary otherwise this is great stuff at a great price i would definitely recommend it
not so satisfied with the flavor although the ingredients are really good
i used this for a tiffany bridal shower the paper was perfect color and quality of paper highly recommend
loved the balloons but the tassel banner was horrible while trying to put it together it kept tearing and breaking really upsetting just purchase a banner already put together i didnt realize that it wasnt already in one piece horrible quality
to be used sparingly
i always have difficulty keeping heels from slipping when i walk  these are the best product i have found my high heels stay on great
i had tried  bath bombs which are the same as these but in a smaller size unfortunately this large size performs slightly differently as ill describe belowthere are 3 super large individually wrapped bath bombs in this set all are large clouds with a smiley face on the package coveringeach one is strongly fragrant when dry and lightly fragrant when in the bath they also all have the same scent the ingredients are sodium bicarbonate citric acid magnesium sulfate water cyclodextrin peg400 hydrogenated jojoba oil hydrogenated grapeseed oil butyrospermum parkii shea butter oil natural essential oil fragrance and fda approved colorantsthese are very very large and fun they perform well produce a lovely rainbow of suds and dissolve in about 1015 minutes the fragrance is subtle in the bath however there is one difference in the results read onsince i personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath i use them in a foot bath when i was done the color did not adhere to my foot bath but it turned both my feet pink and  my drying towel note that the smaller bombs did not do this even though they are the same perhaps it is the extra profusion of color in such a large size this is the only reason i rated this 4 instead of 5 starsthe current cost of  1999 for 3 bombs comes to a very expensive 666 per bomb however these are certainly way different from typical bath bombs i like these very much but would have loved them if it did not color my feet and towels note that the color does wash off the towels in the laundry and in the shower for my feet
when i read the review that said she was having trouble sleeping due to her psoriasis i thought this is something i have to try i cant sleep either but its because of allergies and my skin feels like its on firei tried it as soon as the package arrived oh baby where have you been all my life its so cooling which would have been enough but it also leaves my face feeling baby smooth at my age thats a big plus i just used a little bit and its made a huge differencei believe ill be using this cream for a very long time thanks
makes nails smooth without the use of a dile
i have placed two orders of these roller bottles and love them  they are wonderful and have been a lifesaver for me when i wake with cramps or aches in the middle of the night  i also take two with me when i leave the house
its sadly not that good iso100 fruity pebble for some reason tastes miles ahead of this product why it sweet but not in a great way and is just disappointing but its easy to drink the rest of it since i spent the money on it
product is cheap and dont trust fake reviews  worked twice before electronics gave out  complete waste of money and manufacturer doesnt stand behind products
easy to read and reference for lab values and all sorts of tidbits  convenient
i have been using this to make my own vape juice and my other half likes it better than the store bought version
love this heating pad very nice size
great brush especially for travel  fits with the dry oil tin
awesome  cheaper than almost all other  just as good
could not work without them can read for pleasure w ease
we purchased these for use in hotels as we travel alot  these have been fantastic at taking that unknown as well as the known orders from hotel rooms  not to mention just deleting cooking smells when we have a room that has a kitchen but no windows that open or fans  even fish
we use this in a 10 x 12 bedroom that once had fire damage from a chimney fire even after killz paintnew hardwood new fixtures central air running we could still smell it a little in one corner of the room we recently had a baby and the newborn being in the room with us made me finally try this  and it worked at first i was a little uneasy about having something plugged in and running 247 but it only works well if running at all times  it does put off a little bit of light and it sounds like a small fan  so its not super quiet but the white noise is good for the baby anyway so i enjoy it overall im very very happy with this
not good will not hole
my skin is soft and my ancestors are pleased great bath sponge not rough against my skin but still very exfoliating highly recommend
this is the only tool ive ever found that removes the water ring in our toilets  works beautifully  we also have water rings around our kitchen sink drain and it takes it off immediately
this is a very nice version of the auto roller delivered on time works like a charm i might go as far as to say this is the nicest one ive ever had or used
great i will purchase again
really love it  using it makes my face better and better i use it everyday
best price i could find and arrived earlier than expected
i was trying to get the hard water stains off my shower door id say the product helped but did not get rid of the spots will try again maybe it needs more  frequent applications
as adverised
my husband and i just got this model after trying a different brand that only allowed us 2 hours of heat i was worried that i wouldnt be happy with the size because the other one was larger but this one is plenty big we both like using it to keep our feet warm and it certainly does that plus im not waking up every few hours to turn it back on i love how quickly it heats up and its also very soft we think were going to forget the heated mattress pad this winter and just go with this
my aria scale has worked great for over a year easy to use daily i just wish it wasnt such a pain to reset it and reconnect to the new network when i changed the network name ultimately works great though
its funny because my whole life i have never had cracked or dry feet and i always went barefoot but for like the last 5 years or so i have tried to always wear something on my feet when i go outside and now my feet are always dry and cracking sometimes it is pretty bad and very painful this foot file just took seconds to use it does not hurt at all and my feet were alot smoother and softer  when i got done i really like that this can be used wet or dry it is very light weight and super easy to use the buffer is made from a natural ceramic and the handle is a beech wood handle that is very smooth it does have a hole on the handle and it has a piece of twine so you can hang it when not in use it is very comfortable to hold while using it on your feet
its shorter than i am comfortable with also it does not screw into the bottle so a little unnerving to squeeze it for fear of having the thing pop off into the mess
they are cheap and durable they will serve you well for long time they are not very sharp compares to more professional sets however they will do the job as good as many sets in the market
i noticed that they must have changed the ingredients in the works it does not clean off rust build up as easily as it did years ago you have to scrub quite aggressively to get the buildup off now
this tastes pretty good although it does have a bit of that protein flavor it mixed in well although the directions say to mix in two whole scoopsall in all its pretty decent for the price
