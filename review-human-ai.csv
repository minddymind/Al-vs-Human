this is a nice basket of bath bombs the basket itself is a decent quality the bath bombs are a little smaller than i expected but they seem to explode slowly so you can relish the experience for a moment or two the bombs are individually wrapped in plastic which has been a little difficult to open the first bomb that i used said it was grapefruit but didnt smell anything like the fruit it had more of a flowery perfume scent the next one that i used was the peppermint one and it did smell like peppermint so i dont know if the grapefruit one was mislabeled or not the bombs havent left any noticeable rings in the tub this would make a great gift,human

started using march 25 2015 so dont know how it is working yet,human
its still too early to tell if this product is effective but so far im optimistic,ai
i love these aromatic steamer shower bombs they are vividly colored appropriately sized delightfully scented and affordably priced and they always provide an invigorating shower experience each disk comes individually wrapped and the entire set is attractively packaged but i will say that any other scented products i use at the same time as these overpower the fragrant scent of these bombs simply because body washes and shampoos are closer to my nose the air is scented strongly for up to about 3 feet above each bomb and they dissolve cleanly without staining surfaces so id still recommend this boxed dozen to others,human
these shower steamer bombs are colorful aromatic and dissolve cleanly the scent is lovely but gets overpowered by nearby shampoos or soaps still they provide an invigorating experience and come beautifully packaged,ai

no complaints at all about these generic replacement heads for a sonicare they fit well on my sonicare  not so tight that they are difficult to get on or off and not so loose that they come off too easily the fit is pretty much the same as the authentic sonicare brushesalthough these are described as being soft i would rate the bristles as medium or perhaps mediumsoft the bristles are definitely harder than the sonicare ultra soft version but are not as hard as the sonicare regular brushes i would have preferred that they be just a tad softer than they are but they are not so hard as to cause any notable gum irritation the oblong head shape is good for getting at the gum line and reaching molarsthe set of 8 come in a single box with each brush individually sealed in a plastic pouch plus theres a cap over the end of each brush i much prefer this type of packaging versus the blister pack method used by other generic replacement heads its easier to deal with and creates less packaging wasteno significant complaints about these  good value for the price,human

this did not clean my teeth better than my electric toothbrush i can feel it alas i still gave it a few days and nights to see how my teeth feeli will be sticking with the electric brush as the bristles can actually get in between my teeth this is a dense brush and i can see why they call it the cloud toothbrush on instagramfb it is really soft so for those with very sensitive gums try this its worth checking out to see if it helps youi also felt kind of nasty thinking about how id get this completely clean if i continue using it for the full amount of time as it seems food could easily get trapped in the dense bristles it does have a textured back which i assume to be a tongue cleaner however its useless each brush is in its own container with breathing holes however those are also very flimsy so if you get this knowing youll love it i would grab a toothbrush case separatelybasically felt like i was brushing with a sponge,human

i have a lot of low backhip pain and after a day of sitting at the computer all day kills me i cant afford a fancy ergonomic office chair so i was ecstatic to see this show up ive been using it for a couple weeks now and im amazed that i feel as good or better at the end of the day as i do when i start working it conforms easily to my back while still providing excellent support its not overly molded so that it only fits one body typeshape the unique design of the rubber stays firm when and where needed but is soft and cushy where needed tooone thing to note is that the cover is a stretchy fabric like spandex which allows it to stretch over the cushion but fit closely to it there are two loops on the back which allow you to run a belt or rope to tie it in place onto your chair however since the fabric is so stretchy and the cushion fairly heavy it pulls down into the seat rather than staying against the chair back so i still have to push it up and into place when i come back to the chair im thinking of sewing a more structured cover that wont stretch so much to keep it in place betteri received a discount in exchange for an honest review,human

used this soap the day that i received it  havent a negative thing to say about this product  it is just exactly described justas it is  very hard in the container and looks as though its been poured in  while it was hot  very rustic looking in the plasticcontainer  as it is supposed to lookyou can tell that some serious work went into the making of this soap  by its performance  after running hot water into thebowl and using a fine shaving soap brush  you will get a very rich creamy good smelling lather  you will get a close shavewith minimal nicks and irritationanother fine point is  you will enjoy a unique old time barbershop scent while shaving  an important point is  this soap isin line with other brands of shaving soaps according to price  you cannot order a good quality can of shaving soap for lessthat 15 dollars  this shaving soap is somewhat a cut above your average shaving soap on the market today  therefore  ican comfortably say that this shaving soap is a fair price for the quality that it  factually isit appears that you will able to get months of shaving from this reasonably large can of shaving soap  the container is not a cheapplastic  it is a heavy duty plastic jar with a screw on lid that fits precision and will screw on tightly to keep your soap freshthis container will not allow your soap to dry out  all in all  i cannot find fault with this product or the seller,human

there are some good things and less good about this but the review comes with the caveat that sleep preferences are so individual that its tough to say how much ones view should hold for someone else but that said1 size  the footprint is nice it doesnt take up a lot of space id call it medium size maybe leaning toward small ive definitely seen many that were bigger so you dont need a lot of space to use this2 lighting  id prefer a dimmer light personally thought the breath function and colors are nice if you have this right near the bed its a bit too bright id say but if its obstructed or youre  not facing it than it isnt bad at all3 volume  volume control is goodim not sure why youd want it loud i guess if you have a lot of street noise but it can get a decent volume on it4 sounds  this was the more problematic issue for us we just didnt find many of the sounds pleasurable or soothing some would have soothing parts but then a loud surge of sound would appear which would seem to defeat the purpose weve heard others that were just more tranquil soothing some of that can be somewhat ameliorated by the volume control obviously but still wasnt what we were expecting there are a good number and variety but honestly wed only use 3 possibly 4 on the other hand if youre looking for drownout sound you might find that less of an issue5 timer is good and works well never understood ones that came without them so this is a good id say required touchits a useful solid product but not quite as allaround useful as its numbers of lightssounds might indicate at least for us  no concerns over qualityfeels well constructed and responsive,human

biz beats every other laundry additive ive every used  my mom used it decades ago when i was growing up and it still works better than anything else on the market  i cant figure out why its so hard to find in stores  i guess because they dont spend a lot on mass advertising so there is little demand  most sellers on amazon were pretty expensive imo but by buying a pack of 4 boxes i got the best price  itll probably last until my grandkids grow up but at least i have a good stash now  for really tough stains make a paste and spread the paste on stain  let it sit and work for up to hours before washing  ive never had an issue with this technique damaging colors,human

so i had been buying the primal life dirty mouth tooth powder and was loving it except the price was gouging me so i went on the hunt for a more affordable tooth powder option i stumbled upon this for half the price and decided to give it a go in terms of tooth cleanliness it probably works about the same ya about the same however it sucks every single last drop of moisture out of your mouth the second it hits it the mint is also not very strong at all it in no way helps freshen my breath and my husband and i have started having to use mouth wash which imo defeats the purpose of going chemical free also because it does suck moisture out ive found that chunks of it get stuck to my teeth or gums and i have to do a clean run through of my toothbrush with just water on it to get this off just swigging with water wont do it weve hand this over a month and still have over half the jar left so honestly its a good amount of product for what you payim still on the fence though if im gonna reorder this or go back to the primal life toothe powder,human
i switched from a more expensive tooth powder to this one it works similarly in terms of cleanliness but dries out my mouth the second i use it the mint flavor isnt strong and it doesnt freshen my breath so i ended up using mouthwash ive had this for over a month and still have plenty left but im undecided about reordering or going back to the previous product,ai

i was really looking forward to receiving this item because of the way it appeared on the site unfortunately my first night using it was a bid disappointment the mask is soft and plush to the touch however when worn at night the nose bridge part presses way too hard on the top of the nose and impedes breathing if i loosen the strap which is not velcro and gets tangled in the hair the mask then is too loose and falls off the face the pads press just too much on the bottoms of the eyes and make it uncomfortable to breathe and turn the head the strap gets tangled in the hair because you cant velcro it over the back you have to pull it over the head the padding is weighted incorrectly and caused me discomfort while trying to breathe and sleep with it therefore i had to return it  maybe for less sensitive sleepers this might work  but this was advertised as designed for ultra comfort and sensitivity,human
i had high hopes for this product based on the description but it didnt work out the mask is soft but the nose bridge presses too hard affecting my breathing the strap tangles in my hair and loosening it doesnt help the weighted padding caused discomfort so i had to return it maybe its better for those who dont have sensitive sleep needs,ai

this could have a been a nice desserty protein bar coming out of your dessertsnacks calorie budget instead of the main meals unfortunately the various mass market ingredients they put in it give it a not so pleasant after taste an after taste i never get with protein bars that use only 34real food34 ingredientsso while it tastes fine while you eat it and tempts you to forgive the long list of ingredients the after taste is a reminder of what it is  maybe they can make 34real food34 version of thisthe 6pack is stored in a sturdy compact purple cardboard box which you can easily repurpose for other household uses if you open it gentlynutrition wise it has plenty of vitamins and minerals protein 34wins34 1514 over sugars itt is a product of canadasweetening in this is done with among others glucose syrup sugar glycerine high maltose corn syrup evaporated cane sugar fructose dextrose etcthis is so frustrating because its a promising taste combo with 15g of protein but you get all kinds of corporate food crap including carrageenan,human

i heard about these a few years ago how great they are for your teeth well after finally trying them i must say that they did not disappoint first of all with these each one is individually wrapped and they look very sanitary i didnt feel uncomfortable at all peeling off the outer bark and chewing on the stick it does have a flavor which is sort of indescribable but bits can come off in your mouth and they are much like shredded coconut anyway after softening and chewing the tip in your mouth by gently chewing on it the fibers fan out to form a brush while the stick is long its impossible to get the inside of your teeth but as you use it up its easier to get your hand in thereso i wouldnt use these as a replacement for my toothbrush but they are a wonderful accompaniment my teeth feel great after using it it brushes all the plaque away and leaves you feeling super clean but without any mint each stick lasts quite a while because you only use half an inch each time and then use a scissors to snip off the used part so that it remains sanitaryif youve never tried these all i can say is that my experience was pretty good and i would definitely recommend them i hope this review and the video has helped you to decide if youd like to invest in these,human

its fine i have my preferences over this this is a nice blend of various collagen sources bovine marine poultry eggshell and therefore a wider degree of collagen types 1 2 3 5 10 hence the elevated price tag i dont rate on price but i will comment that it should be compared to others of this ilk it is with similar price range some sources are more expensive some sources dont require as much to be effective ie bovine is cheapest but needs more marine is usually most expensive yet needs a lot less this has a good amount well fair amount per serving at about 8 grams of collagen peptides hydrolyzed meaning it is broken down to readily absorbable easily digestible form and it mixes in hot or cold without gellingmulti forms can impart a slight smell and flavor i think the ones that use eggshell tend to have a little extra aroma may disappear depending on what it is being used in or might be noticeable not a big fan of it in my plain black unsweetened coffee but is totally fine in a smoothie or when i have a coffee that i doctor up with cream and flavor syrup i dont fault the brand as it is merely a facet of the composition i will always used collagen often single source but will pepper in multi source as i see fitthis is a perfectly fine product though i recommend that they actually include a picture of the nutritional information we dont need to see half a dozen pictures of people drinking it let us know what is in it had i been shopping around for it i would have passed this over for a listing that tells me all that i am gettingthough i am pleased to see thisif youre not 100 satisfied with your purchase well issue you a refund,human
this product offers a nice blend of collagen from various sources bovine marine poultry eggshell giving it a variety of collagen types the price is higher than some but its reasonable for the amount 8 grams per serving it might have a slight taste or smell especially from the eggshell but its not noticeable in smoothies or flavored coffee i would appreciate it if the nutritional info were displayed more clearly on the packaging overall a solid product,ai

i thought these would be perfect for selecting my favorite sneakers and playing golf in them you have to be careful what sneakers you use for this and anything with air bladders is not recommended due to puncturing and also your sneakers are design for a sure footed response with their current soles so when you add these cleats they can be very uncomfortable on your feet when the ground is hard and dry not so bad when its wet and soft overall i lost more than i would have liked and so i have to give these a clear thumbs down,human

all of the liquid liposomal vitamin c products that ive reviewed have all had a strong flavor  not bad but some people might like to dilute in water or something i take it straight out of the bottle but the sweetened citrus flavoring is strong i most definitely prefer a liposomal form of vitamin c whether its capsules or liquid liposomal vitamin c stays in your system much longer than the water soluble ascorbic acid which is excreted quickly by the body liposomal means the ascorbic acid is wrapped in a fat blanket sunflower oil and is therefore carried much further and longer in your system fighting cold and flu viruses this bottle of liposomal vitamin c is nearly the same as all the others ive reviewed so theres a lot of them to choose from i can find nothing negative to say about this liquid liposomal vitamin c,human
all the liquid liposomal vitamin c products ive tried have had a strong flavor which some might want to dilute in water i take it directly from the bottle and the citrus flavor is quite strong however i prefer liposomal vitamin c whether in liquid or capsule form because it stays in your system longer than regular ascorbic acid which is excreted quickly the bottle of this product is comparable to others ive tried and theres nothing negative to report about it,ai

this set is made in china and does not have specific brand labeling  so it could be sold as any brand  for that reason youll want to look around to see who is offering the best price  i find the current price of twentyfour bucks to be quite expensive for plastic rods and brushes made in chinathe instructions show that you will probably want to use duct tape to secure each section together after you screw them together  this  is certain true as sections could unscrew as your working the brush backandforth   especially if using a drillyou may also wish to use super glue or some other glue to attach the brush head so that it does come unscrewedthe rods are not that flexible  the more rods you attach then the more curved it can become   but  if you that some tight turns then this may not workthis set comes with two brushes  the bristles are a good combination of flexible  stiff  the  brush is 4inches across and about 175 wide  the brushes must be used separately and can to be attached togetheri wish that someone would invent a dryer vent cleaner where you could attach some kind of hose to a vacuum cleaner  because once you use such a brush    youre going to have to get the lint out  if you have such a hose then you could possible attach it to this brush  pole set,human
this product is made in china and lacks a specific brand label so it could be sold by any brand while the price of 24 seems high for plastic rods and brushes i recommend shopping around for the best price the instructions suggest using duct tape to keep the sections together after screwing them in which is necessary since they can come undone during use the rods arent very flexible and theyre not ideal for tight turns the set includes two brushes with bristles that are both stiff and flexible overall i wish there was a vacuum hose attachment option for cleaning out lint after use,ai

i didnt really know what i was getting into ive been discovering all sorts of new beauty and health tools  mostly good  and was especially excited to see this might help my hair i didnt really know what i was getting into here thankfully i read the instruction manual before starting and saw the warning about using this if you have metallic implants i messaged eternal clear and received a speedy response that it was safe to use this as long as i stayed 15 away from my metal rods yayso i had already noted that everything arrived safely neatly boxed and sealed i was worried the bulbs were defective at first because they didnt light up right away i wasnt even sure if they were supposed to but i persisted and eventually they all lit up i dont know if it was a coincidence but one finally lit up when i moved my hand closer toward it they all seemed to light up much easier after the first time the electric buzzing and smell is kind of scary but as soon as i was told i could proceed i plucked up the courage to try this on the lowest setting im not even sure it was a setting because theres a pretty wide range between on and where the dots indicating intensity start im slowly working on getting used to the sounds smells and feel first i found the dial easy to turn im proceeding cautiously but optimistically,human

this is a really coollooking shaver my son is into skulls and thinks this is the neatest thing ever he says all of the shaving and trimming functions work quite well which was a bit unexpected for a seemingly novelty device but when it comes to the brushes they dont clip into the base and stay there therefore once turned on they can fall out at any time the instructions do say to attach the brushes place them against your face and then turn the shaver on so maybe they are just held on by pressure the instruction booklet is a good size and readable which is a plus in my bookaside from the brushes not snapping into the shaver as all the other attachments do this shaver looks cool and also functions very well i would definitely recommend it especially for skull lovers and teenage boys just starting out shaving 4 stars,human

this package came with two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam ear plugs one sleep mask is black on both sides and the other has purple on one side and black on the other  the fabric is smooth and soft against the skin the elastic band that holds the mask on is doubled over and is adjusted by sliding the fastener rather than with a bulky snap or velco closure i find this closureadjustment method more comfortable than my current sleep mask the mask is thick enough to block light and the mask does narrow as in has a cut out in the nose area for a somewhat better fit but there is no molding or pillowed area to hold the mask above your eyes or fill the gap created between the cheek and the nose so light does get under the mask the mask lies directly against my eyelashes and i dont really care for that the stitching is neatthe mask measures 85 across by 4 high or 35 high where it dips up at the nose area the elastic can be adjusted between about 8 to 15 of length for a total mask  elastic length of 165 to 235,human

my wife has major knee issues  i purchased this and installed per instructions  if youre a handy man type this will pose no problem for the installation  the white color matched the white porcelain of the toilet  the base of the toto drake is longer than toilevators 223 inch length and extends off the platform 1 inch in the back  it doesnt effect stability  i know it can hold just over 300 lbs without structural failure in the 2 months we have had iti purchased the item because there were no ada or otherwise round toilets available 35 taller than the drake and this toto has been great operationally and for longevity of parts  with the toilevators 35 lift i kept my original toilet and my wifes knees are much easier to extend when she stands up  i was rather concerned about the weight but it said 500 lbs was the limit  it has proved sound  it has been easy to clean  the toilet hasnt shifted or slid on the base  the bolts extended higher than the top of the toto toilet base  i just purchased a deep cap rather than cut them  all needed items are in the kit except for the deeper bolt cap covers  i also needed a new bowl gasket seals the tank to the bowl as i took off the tank to make handling much easier for methe only issue for me were the closet bolts that were supplied these connect the toilet base and the toilevator to the sewer flange at the floor  the heads of the bolts were round not flat and appeared to be galvanized  they should be stainless steel  they would not fit under the flange  i simply ground the head and sides down a bit till they fit and applied plumbers grease to the threads to prevent the bolt and nut becoming rusted together  years of experience have taught me to think ahead,human
we installed this for my wifes knee issues and the setup was straightforward the lift worked well making it easier for her to stand up the toilet remains stable and everythings held up well just be aware of the boltsthey needed a bit of adjustment but overall its a solid product,ai

review after one week of use had some doubts that this would work as well as stated for the incredible task  at hand  a laundry room that is the nighttime spot for 3 dogs every morning we open the door and gasp at the horror of the stench a good thorough mopping might clean the floor but the air is rank with stinky dog that no aerosol air freshener can conquer plugged this in as soon as it arrived and within an hour it was pleasant even when the pack comes in wet it has made a big difference now to see how long it lastsupdate after a month the dogs are winning it no longer clears out the smell the way it did in the beginning if my laundry room were bigger id purchase another larger unit like the one we use for the whole house maybe that would work for now we might just have to invest in face masks,human
one week update i was initially unsure about this product especially with such a challenging task ahead  eliminating the strong odor in a laundry room shared by three dogs the smell in the room was overpowering and no air freshener could neutralize it once i plugged this in the room smelled much more pleasant within an hour even when the dogs come in wet it makes a noticeable difference now lets see how long it holds up update after a month unfortunately the product is no longer as effective as before if my laundry room were larger i would consider a bigger model like the one we use for the whole house for now i might need to invest in face masks,ai

we have several similar products in the house  during this covid19 we try to take our vitamins and stay hydrated  this is a very nice item to have around  my wife and i are actually both drinking one nowmy biggest complaint is the salty taste  i know i know it has salt for electrolytes but my other main one we drink doesnt have this salty taste  i just chugged half the bottle and then refilled it with cold water  i like it better when it is diluted  next time i will just use 12 of one tube in my bottle of wateri do appreciate the vitamins and will continue to use this,human

i really like the idea of this device the vibrations themselves are soothing but because i purchased this to help with long haul covid issues which stem to my understanding at issues with nervous system regulation i didnt consider the fact that one of my symptoms is scalp pain and when im experiencing the scalp pain the location of this device can be somewhat aggravating in addition i had a hard time getting it to rest comfortably behind my ears it had a tendency to move off of my left ear in particular im not sure if its not as suited to certain headear shapesi did find the vibrations to be comforting but it was offset by the discomfort of the pressure on my head aggravated by long haul scalp pain and proclivity to headachesanother issue was that for a product like this i would like to use it more than 2x a day one charge lasts about 4 sessions so it requires frequent recharging if you want to use it more regularly and also using it more regularly i felt more discomfort from the pressure on my headears so not an ideal device for frequent usei only ended up using it a few days before deciding to return i really like the idea and i did enjoy the sensation of the vibration but it wasnt wellsuited for my needs at this time,human

ive been using the aria for about a month now and im really pleased with it i like that it takes a new measurement every time you step on ive had some scales in the past that didnt seem to budge unless you lost or gained a pound or two and sometimes that big jump was quite unwelcome it measures quickly identifies me and syncs right to my fitbit account immediately i was initially concerned because the bathroom that it is located in has the worst wifi connection in my whole house but so far i havent missed a single reading on itthe bodyfat  definitely does fluctuate but as im familiar with other devices that measure bodyfat i also know that things as simple as whether your stomach is empty or full and how dehydrated you are can cause this to fluctuate quite a bit the percentage itself might not be extremely accurate but if you weigh yourself at the same time and under similar circumstances daily ie first thing in the morning before youve eaten or had anything to drink then it is accurate enough to let you know whether your percentage is increasing or decreasing over time this isnt a professional bodyfat measuring tool and its unreasonable to expect it to work as well as oneim the only one currently using my scale so i cant comment on the difficulties some people have with multiple users or guest users setting it up was extremely simple and now i dont have to wonder if i remembered to log my weight in my fitbit account or not in fact now i cant do things like 34forget34 to log my weight after a rough weekend i like to know where im at on my journey so i dont find myself avoiding getting on the scale to avoid having the weight logged which i was actually worried about overall it has just become a comfortable part of my routine and caused me to have to be a bit more accountable to myself im quite happy with my aria,human
ive been using the aria scale for about a month and its been great it takes a new measurement each time i step on which is a feature i love compared to my old scales that only showed slight changes the sync with my fitbit account is seamless and ive had no issues with the weak wifi in my bathroom body fat percentage can fluctuate but its reliable enough to show trends over time if you weigh yourself consistently setting it up was simple and it has become a part of my daily routine overall im happy with my purchase,ai

i hate how so many supplements use artificial sweeteners that make everything so sickeningly sweet this protein powder is actually not as sweet as many that ive tried definitely more of a natural amount of sweetness that i really appreciate tastes just like a sweetened creamy latte i add this to my morning coffee and its just perfectthis doesnt state whether it has caffeine in it or not but i dont believe it does despite the cold brew flavorthe reason i took a star off was the packaging i was super excited to receive a bagged protein powder because the super large and usually half empty containers of protein powders take up so much counter space unfortunately it just doesnt seal back up very well did not feel air tight at all i didnt want it to lose freshness so i just put it in a different container wish the sealing strip had worked better,human

i love the portability of the individual days of this pill case attache it is great for 2xs per day doses however i have a few dislikesloves each day is portable each side is large enough to hold about10 pills as long as they are not super large i find it easy to fill the pu carrying case makes the pill compartments easy to carry dislikes the pill cases are tightly enclosed in the case making it a bit difficult to remove each day there is no am pm written on each cell instead there is a moon and sun the days written on the side of the case are only one one side since the cells move around in the case the day of the week is not always visiblein summary even though this is large i like that each circular day container can be taken in a purse for one day and there is no need to take the entire container they also hold a sufficient amount of pills for me unfortunately my dislikes have me rating this case 3 stars the current price of 1099 is reasonable for this and a lot cheaper than the same case in black that is 5 more by another vendor,human
i love the portability of this pill organizer its great for doses twice a day but the only downside is that the pill cases are a little tricky to remove its also missing ampm labels only showing sun and moon icons overall its really convenient but these small drawbacks keep me from giving it a perfect rating,ai

the goodi absolutely loved this thing until it came apartit was easy to install and adjust to my 2004 colorado taking only about 10 minutes with a wrench ratchet and socket sitting at the car door in my wheelchair it could have been done with two pair of pliers though once adjusted it simply lifts out of place when someone else needs to drive the vehicle and is easily returned to position when i am ready to drive againit was only a short learning curve until i was completely comfortable driving with itit was the only left foot gas pedal accessory that i found that didnt have to be bolted to the floorthe badafter only two months the glue that held the plastic base that has the spikes that hold it secure in place by engaging the vehicles carpet completely let go as shown in the pics i would return it but for two reasons i dont want to be without it and i am afraid that the glue on the new one will give out in two more monthsthis is a potentially dangerous problem and you should be watching for it if you already have one or intend to buy oneconclusioni am not saying that you should not buy one but you should be aware of this fatal flaw and be aware that you may have to reglue it furthermore for 300 there should be some thought at the manufacturers level as to how to fix this serious problem,human

container  stiff pretty fits in car cup holder no lid so after use you just have a tall cylinder with a hole on toptissue rougher than kleenex softer than hospitalhotel tissue works for wiping nose but rough cold or touch up on makeup no also smaller than kleenex comparison in picture so softer prettier hospital tissue also because its rough and stuffed so tight its really difficult to pull only one out i ended up pulling out a lot and tear all of them very frustratingoverpriced for the quality these shouldnt be more than ten in my opinion,human

ive never used anything like this before so my dissatisfaction may simply be user error ill try it again and update if i get it to work well but they say to only use it twice a week for no more than 5 minutes so it may take weeks to figure out what works i got this when i had a blackhead thats not on my face only to learn that this is only supposed to be used on the face on skin that is not thin so i decided to try it on my nose and around my mouth where it tends to get greasy and clogged though my skin was left red with increased circulation i didnt see any pus in the chamberthere are five suction heads to choose from and the directions detail why you would choose one over the other they also describe how to use the different heads most effectively the heads are easy to snap on and pull off they included several sponges that you put between the section head and the vacuum to catch any pus and these sponges are washable and reusable to clean after use you remove the head and the sponge and clean themi got a washcloth steaming with hot water and held it over my chin to nose like they suggested to help enlarged pores i then dried off the area as they dont want any water suctioned into the machine and immediately started using the machine on the preset vacuum level i thought it was level 3 but it turns out it was only level 2 out of 5 still this seem pretty strong to me you run the vacuum head over the area lift and repeat for 1 to 2 minutes the head also has tiny led red and blue lights that shine at your face while youre doing thisyou longpress the power button to turn the power on and off but shortpress it to change between blackhead vacuum mode cold compress mode and hot compress mode there is also a button to change the vacuum speed the cold compress reaches its coolest temperature 20c68f very quickly and youre supposed to use this on an area that has just been vacuumed to help close the pores i feels pleasantly cool the hot compress is supposed to reach a temperature between 38c and 42c or 1004f to 1076f it got up to 31c then started dropping then it turned off automatically this was not warm enough to do anything but feel pleasantly warm i dont see how it could help open pores when hot steam didnt noticeably work,human
im still figuring out how to use this effectively i tried it on my nose and around my mouth but didnt see much difference the vacuum is strong and it has multiple suction heads the cold compress feature feels nice but the hot compress didnt get warm enough to make a difference,ai
the best part of this sound machine is that an alexatype voice speaks to you as you set the timer 15 minutes press button 30 minutes 60 minutes etc it has a soft foreign accent that i cant place but its cute most sound machines dont have a human voice saying anything i guess its needed because there are no light buttons to tell you which setting youre choosingexcept for this i felt this device feels cheaply made the casing feels cheap hard brittle plastic and the buttons on the interface are not sensitive to touch you have to press really hard sometimes to get it to change settings the volume control is also confusing  there are actually two volume controls  one to raise the volume one to lower i was pressing one volume control the loud one thinking that i could lower it but i was mistaken  you have to press the low volume buttonon the positive side the night light works well  the colors are neon bright and you can keep a steady color going all night long or cycle through the different colors the timer like i said has a human voice which is kind of cool the weak parts are the button responsiveness and some of the sounds the lullaby function is good and the sound is sharp and clear the nature sounds are relatively good  the best are the chirping bird sounds and thunderstorm but the water sounds ie ocean babbling brook sound muffled and are not particularly sharp the white noise is also kind of indistinct and the fetal heartbeat sound is just plain crude  not so much a heartbeat but like someone else noted its like banging drumssoits a serviceable device but i would not pay too much for this there are so many better ones out there,human
this sound machine has a unique featurea humanlike voice announces the timer settings which is quite cute the build quality is not the best and the buttons require a firm press to work however the night light is bright and the sounds like birds and thunderstorms are enjoyable its functional but not amazing for the price,ai
i ordered this shaver for my husband to try and weve had nothing but problems with it it wasnt charged at all upon receiving it it was completely dead  we put it on the charger for several hours as the manual recommended and it workedwhile charging there is a red light next to where the cable plugs in and the light stays lit all the time  even after the shaver is charged so you never knew if the battery if fully charged and whether or not it will overheatthe shaver manual is not much help and in fact makes this product more confusing the printed manual and writing on the shaver box have conflicting charging instructions the manual says to charge up to 8 hours and advises no longer  the box says 1 hour for 60 minutes of shaving this is kind of confusing because my husband was never able to get 60 minutes of use after charging  he was only able to get 2 shaves each at about 7 minutes before the battery went dead and had to be rechargedso my husband will not be using this shaver since the battery keeps going dead and the rotary blades are weakening from pressing the shaver against his face  this shaver is a nogo,human
i bought this shaver for my husband but it had charging issues the light stays on all the time and the battery doesnt last long enough for a full shave the manual is confusing and overall it hasnt performed well my husband wont be using it anymore,ai

first i purchased these directly from the manufacturer  thus it doesnt say 34verified34 purchase for me  i went to the manufacturer because i wanted to try a smaller set 1 month set which was not offered on amazon when i purchased it1  a 34one month supply34 is really only a one week supply  the 34effects34 are supposed to last one month  misleading to say the least  should say its a one week supply2  i took pictures that show no difference to my eye  note  i used exactly as described on instructions  also my front top 4 teeth are 15 year old porcelain overlays  supposedly this system is safe and effective on dental work as well as natural teeth  i didnt see it3  it is messy and a two step process tube  1 is the a super stain treater and then tube 2 which you apply after using tube 1  the pic i have included was after tube 2  note  the tubes themselves were a serious pain most of the time they were extremely difficult to get open even with 34careful bending34 per instruction  i think i had one tube that actually opened without considerable force which causes the swab to be displaced making it more difficult to apply the treatment  they also include a tube that you are to use while you are out and about and have eaten or had something to drink that could be potentially staining  it has a soft brush like tip4 initially the solution didnt really effect me one way or the other however by the end of the 7 days my gums were very sensitive  i have a sonic toothbrush with an all purpose name brand toothpaste and brushed my teeth prior to each treatment which i chose to do in the mornings5  it is obviously a peroxide formula of some sort  you can taste it  with a bit of mint or something mixed in but there is no hiding the peroxide flavor6 in the end photos dont lie  i dont see any improvement at all  photo number 1 is before feb 17 photo number 2 is feb 23  the rest were photos i would like to see if i were considering a purchase  hope it helpsin my opinion these are a waste of time and money i included the photos so you could make your own decision  i never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful but honestly i will not be buying these again either from the manufacturer or from amazon,human
i bought this directly from the manufacturer because they offered a smaller set not available on amazon however the onemonth supply is really only a oneweek supply the treatment was messy and difficult to apply due to hardtoopen tubes additionally i didnt see any improvement after using it as instructed overall i was disappointed with the product and would not purchase it again,ai

id have to say its the first time ive reviewed a product works as advertised but still only gets 1 star the manufacturer doesnt try to hide the fact that it will keep your bong cleaner but not clean honesty is refreshinghowever i have a triple honeycomb disk ice bong and rezblock seems to create a film of its own above the uppermost disk where it only receives liquid during a hit when not being hit for a while that section sits and dries leaving a pink tinge to the resin buildup in that area being that its an ice bong i cant access that area from above to clean it separately to be honest its pricey considering i still have to break out the rezcaps pickling salt and isopropyl every three days anywayno one shows off a new state of the art bong thats nearly clean,human
while the product does help keep your bong cleaner it doesnt fully clean it for the price i still have to clean it manually every few days its effective but not perfect for all situations,ai

this was an unexpected little surprise  i will admit upfront i purchased this free to review iti do not end up purchasing everything i am offered i do not believe in purchasing things or taking things i will not use  this however was intriguing to me  i have long hair that is past my waist and i already use hair straighteners and curling wands  i am 43 and with long hair one must be careful to not fall into the category of having old lady hair that should not be long  i love my hair and love good hair styling products and hair products in generalthe brush registers in celsius but the instructions tell you what settings to use so getting past the learning curve it is easy  the thing can get hot  and i would not just set it on the counter  the back of it gets very hot even when it is cooling downa con is where the buttons are located  when i am using it i keep turning it either off or hotter or cooler  the buttons are in a very very bad spoti have used this on slightly damp hair and dry hair and i say it works best on slightly damp hair  small sections also work the besti have not had any problems with melting plastic or anything  no weird smells  no hair burningdoes it make my hair straighter  actually  yes  and softer too  that was the pleasantly surprised part  do i like this better than my name brand hair straightener  i dont know  i think i like them both differently  i think this straightener is faster  i think my name brand straightener makes for smoother hair  i guess i am also afraid of damaging my hair and since this is made out of country i do not know much about the ceramics used and so i am very conservative and cautious when i use thisi have attached a picture of before and after use  this was damp just showered hairoverall a good purchase  i plan on using it often,human
i was pleasantly surprised by this product though i received it free to review it quickly became a favorite as someone with long hair past my waist im cautious with heat tools but this one works well it straightens efficiently especially on slightly damp hair and leaves my hair soft and smooth the instructions were straightforward though the button placement is inconvenienti kept accidentally changing the settings overall a great addition to my haircare routine and ill keep using it,ai

this toilet spray does do a good job of killing odors and is quick and easy to use the scent however is just ok granted pretty much any scent is better than the scent this is meant to cover up but the sea salt scent is more floral than i was expecting its an ok scent but not 100 to my liking the other issue ive had is that the sprayer doesnt always spray properly instead of a mist it sort of splatters the liquid at times making a bit of a mess unless your aim is perfectly true its only happening with one of the containers so it seems that the sprayer is defective given the price point better quality sprayers should have been usedthe scent plus the sprayer issue lowers my score to 4 stars but its otherwise a decent product that does what it says it will do,human

i personally do not like this product it contains caffeine i took two pills and i could not sleep for an entire nightthe concentration of vitamin b12 is too high it doesnt make any sense to take all that vitamin b12 every day your body will discard the rest with urine and you will have a peak of vitamin b12 in the blood despite b12 does not induce cytotoxicity why wasting money in something you dont needadditionally they put in optimind lgaba to compensate the effect of caffeine so why putting caffeine in the first placethis is an extremely expensive itemplease be careful because they are very sneaky if you cancel the free trial subscription period on line on their website in fact you click cancer and you see a message you are almost done however you have to wait a few secondsminutes to display the final please cancer now only then you will receive an email confirming your cancellation this is a very sneaky way to induce people to forget to wait and continue with cancellation and charge them with an additional chargealpha brain is for example a superior product more cost efficient and with no caffeine if people want caffeine they can drink a coffee,human
i wasnt a fan of this product the caffeine content kept me awake all night after taking two pills and the high concentration of vitamin b12 seemed unnecessary since the body excretes the excess additionally the subscription cancellation process feels deceptive requiring extra steps to confirm cancellation if youre looking for an alternative id recommend alpha brain which is more costeffective and caffeinefree,ai

this is a good idea in theory but poorly executedtheres not much in the way of pros and many conspros   1 washable and reusable   1 as others have mentioned this opens up the sides of the mask so so much that it effectively means that youre getting unfiltered air coming in   2 these dont fit an adult face unless you have a small chin to get the mask to cover the nose the bottom edge of the mask will press into your skin above your chin and below your bottom lip its not a super sharp plastic edge but its enough to make a mark when you wear it for a while   3 theres nothing to attach this to the mask so when you remove the mask this will fall off onto the floor or the ground unless you remember to catch it as it falls   4 it doesnt work with regards to preventing your exhalation from fogging up your glasses  it does reduce it a tiny bit but not nearly enough to be usefuli really wish this worked as described although it might work for children hardpass on this particular mask insert well see how some of the others work,human
while the idea behind this mask insert is good the execution falls short it leaves gaps that let in unfiltered air doesnt fit well on adult faces and tends to fall off when removing the mask it also barely reduces fogging for glasses overall its not worth it,ai
this is ok but not great  it says not to use your finger but it doesnt have an applicator so i guess youre supposed to use a tissue  it burned a little when i first put it on  later when i had to wipe it felt a bit numb so i guess the numbing property does work  i dont really like it as much as some of the name brand ones i have,human
this product is okay but not great it lacks an applicator and advises against using fingers so a tissue is the only option it initially burned slightly but did provide some numbing relief later i prefer other brands for better performance,ai
great purchase,human
a fantastic purchase im happy with it,ai
not long enough,human
the item isnt long enough for my needs,ai

this sound machine offers 28 sounds and while most are clear a couple are slightly staticky the timer and nightlight features are handy and its wellpriced at 2339 the userfriendly controls are a bonus but id prefer if an ac adapter were included,ai

the two buttons are not enough i needed 3 buttons on each flap side in order to secure it for both my toddler and newborn,human

i waited 6 months to post my review because i wanted to use this iron long enough i am a seamster  i use my iron every day i have had many irons in my 75 years of life listen to me and do not buy this iron it does not steam but it pours the water in one part of your fabric while other parts are dry this iron has not been made for even nice steam something is wrong i use only distilled water dont pay even 10 dollars for this iron,human

love these they work just great my only peeve is that they squeak but i remedied that by coating the squeaky parts with graphite as a dry lubricant so that it didnt collect dust and hair i have advanced peripheral neuropathy a nerve condition so walking is a pain the cane i used just doesnt cut it anymore i needed support on both sides so i puchased these and can move around swiftly instead of slow,human

flavor not as bad as described,human
the flavor wasnt as unpleasant as i feared,ai
these are now something you may need if wearing a mask for  many hours a day several days a week  the silicone doesnt pull on your hair so its comfortable it can be a bit small depending on the size of your head my husband has a big head and it can be tight depending on the mask straps  they worked fine for me and they have saved my ears from chafing  the ear loops hook easily over the button thingy on the extender  th extender has a small amount  of stretch so you can adjust your mask for the comfort level you prefer,human
these mask extenders are essential for longterm mask use theyre comfortable and adjustable but might feel tight on larger heads they worked well for me and prevented ear chafing,ai
like magic these things scrap away dirt like nothing else i finally found a product that does not scratch but gets dirt off my only problem is they really are one shot only and deteriorate very quickly they cannot take much abuse but they do what no other sponge can,human

slim and well made  it fits perfectly at the end of my 1234 deep cupboard over the sink  the installation was easy because of the numerous slots available for drilling and anchoring the georgia pacific 21000 two ply style towels fit just right and pull out singularly without waste  this is the second commercialstyle towel dispenser that i have purchased for my kitchen in the last four years  the first one was a slim roll design that dispensed single ply towels  the double  ply towels dispensed with this unit are stronger and more absorbent requiring fewer towels for average cleanup in the kitchen  this was actually a costsaving investment,human

i was hesitant to get this based on some of the negative reviews here  but the positive ones convinced me to try it  and the price was good enough that i thought 34why not34first of all i have fibromyalgia and have severe pains and have been desperate  im not someone who is comfortable to get a massage and even if i was i would be poor if i went as often as i would need to  so what to dook  i got it today and tried it about a half an hour ago  i think that alone tells you what i think of this spa mat  that i literally came on here to review it right away  i didnt even bother with 34low34 and went right to 34medium34 high seemed to scare me for the initial setting  i figured itd be similar to a tsunami  the power of the bubbles was amazing  gets you all over and was so powerful that the tub looked like a pot of crazy hot boiling water  and that was on mediumoh and yeah  while a 1015 minute bath is usually cool at the end this amazin beauty keep the water at a nice temp  regarding the mat floating  it does  some of the suction cups stuck great and others did not  frankly who cares  this is supposed to make the water bubble and it does that job fantastically  made me feel good and relaxed   woolastly  other people complained about the noise  the noise of the unit is quiet  the massive bubbling is noisy    and seriously if youre complaining about bubbling noise then why did you get a 34body bubbles bath spa34 mat  lol  personally i liked it and it reminded me of being on vacation and in a big hot tuband for storage i figured that since ill likely be using it 23 times a week the best way to store the mat is just to stick it on the side of the shower wall   perfect so the excess water can drain out and it can dry well,human
i was hesitant but this spa mat exceeded expectations the powerful bubbles were relaxing and the water stayed warm a bit noisy and some suction cups didnt stick but those are minor issues highly recommend it,ai

a word of caution im sensitive to stimulants so the first 3 days this messed with my stomach a bit after that im good to go at 178lbs the recommended dosage is 22 scoops for me because im sensitive to stimulants that is just too much everytime i do two scoops i end up bonking mid workout shaky hands starving have to stop and eat and rest a good half hour before finishing i always eat an hour before my workout and only have this issue with two scoops one scoop for me is perfect makes my face tingle helps me kill my workout i love this stuff so my recommendation is to try it in different dosages until you find your sweet spot maybe you are a 12 scoop person maybe you need the full two scoops ust dont try it once and say its not for you give it time give it a chance youll love it,human
if youre sensitive to stimulants start with a lower dose of this preworkout supplement i found one scoop to be perfectenergizing without overdoing it adjust the dose to your needs and youll love it,ai

these electrolyte packets were a lifesaver they helped my husband recover quickly after surgery and spared us a trip to the hospital highly recommend them for emergencies,ai
i like it its smaller than most pill organizers which i prefer since i only take a few pills but honestly it isnt worth more than 34 wait for the price to go down because even paying 5 for this i thought i was overcharged if you really love the aesthetic of the rainbow go for it but if you need more space for vitamins and pills get something else,human
this pill organizer is compact and visually appealing but its overpriced for its size its ideal if you only take a few pills but wait for a price drop,ai
great for camping or your purse for any cleanups i dont think its worth the money though  theyre not so high quality that its worth it individual packing and natural is why i liked them but wont be repurchasing,human

this provides a subtle as in very subtle differencei cant say that it was enough to justify the price but everyone is different in that area in addition everyones body is different and yours may respond better than minei definitely believe in the theory behind it but im the sort of person that cant wear certain watches because they stop or i touch light switches and get a little shock even when there is no activity that would cause it such as walking on a carpet creating static electricityso do give it a try this is one of those items that cant hurt and might help my hope is that it helps you more than its helped me best of luck to you,human
this product made a very subtle difference for me but i believe it could work better for others its worth a try if youre curious as it wont hurt to experiment,ai

i got the giggles as this thing made my daughters hair and scalp quite literally squeaky clean her hair is insanely thick but very fine and also long weve been battling dandruff for years and tried everything this has been a terrific help and it somehow doesnt tangle her hair in the process im absolutely stoked on this thing and so grateful i stumbled across it,human
this product works wonders for my daughters dandruff while leaving her hair clean and untangled i couldnt be happier,ai
came leaky,human
the product arrived leaking which was disappointing,ai
this was fine except for two things1  its thicker than i thought  it would not fit in the side pocket of my purse2  the one i received the top open too easily  just a baby bump against the closure and out popped all of my pillsso i returned this item,human
this case is too thick to fit in my purse and doesnt stay securely closed so i returned it,ai
as expected fresh product date perfect,human
fresh product and perfect packagingno complaints here,ai
im sorry but i just couldt manage to make this fit in my ear well enough to block sound as designed despite repeated attempts,human
unfortunately i couldnt get this to fit well in my ears no matter how much i tried,ai
good price and work very well,human
a great price for a product that works effectively,ai
works well but i dont get why they are using glass which breaks easily and is dangerous especially when u consider that most of us will stand on it barefootedweigh ourselves naked etc surely luciteacrylic would make more sense,human
the glass construction feels unsafe especially for barefoot users acrylic wouldve been a better choice,ai
originally i thought these files would work just like my crystal nail file from perfect formula a file i have had for years my nails were all finally strong healthy and grown outafter using these files my nails are shredding peeling and down to the nubs several of the top layers of my nails are peeling back even further some nails have 2 3  4 cracks up the nail i just had a horribly painful crack and it tore to the skini thought all these crystal nail files would be the same but they are not,human
these nail files caused damage to my nails instead of strengthening them not recommended,ai
this is the 2nd one ive bought i purchased this because it was dual voltage and we were headed to ireland i used it at home and i really liked the hot brush but the flat iron not so muchthe plates dont touch when i used it in ireland the digital temp display got really hot burned out and stopped working i was about to throw it out and tried one more time to use it and the brush got hot but no digital temp display i used it for the rest of our trip but when we got home it wouldnt turn on  so i ordered another because it really does cut down on my styling time people mention the problem with the button placement but you can lock the temp by double clicking the offon button a couple of times once it reaches the temp you want,human
this dualvoltage styling tool worked well initially but stopped functioning during my trip disappointing durability,ai
the awesome and perfect cloth mask heres my longest review ever and why this is the awesome ppe for mewe have several other masks cloth and disposable masks to compare these masks against i must tell everyone these masks rockseriously this mask is soft soft like a high quality tight woven brushed cotton and soft tshirt that feels so good i cant wait for it to be washedmade in the usa by americans look up their websitei dont know them but i know where they are and they stopped production and are only making face masksthe mask has adjustable ear loops a pouch for inserts like those charcoal filters if you so choosethe mask is so comfortable but here are more reasons why i will wear this mask every time i can because of a unique feature of the strap that goes behind my head furthermore not putting pressure on my head or neck simply rests on my back so i can take the mask off when safe and it simply hangs on my chest or lower no longer having to put it in the visor risk it touching anything but my shirt period i dont have to look for it when i get out of the truck or put it in the pocket my phone was in as cellphones are nasty even though you clean them because i simply raise my mask up by the ear loops and slip it on my ears and snug the strap if its loose double layer full coverage mask from bridge of my nose to under my chin comfortable all day i dont use the carbon filters if needed i would  put a disposable mask in the pocket area on a as necessary basisi dont think i have been so excited about a product since my first boom box just kidding since my iphonethese comes in two different sizes i wear the xl i have wide cheek bones and im chubby my spouse wears the large and has a narrower jawline shaped face and chubbythank you buttonsmith for your part in helping with covid19 by producing more comfortable ppe its hard enough as it islastly mine were shipped out a bit faster than expectedi ordered more,human

not just this one but others that i tried just do not work when training a puppy  on this one  i cleaned the pee spot and sprayed it on  puppy went back to the spot and peed next to it  it would be funny if i wasnt peeved,human

i have spent years making homemade bread for my family and one of my most important tools has been a plastic dough scraper i got from a king arthur seminar several years ago without explanation my scraper simply disappeared without a trace and no one knows what happened to it i think it got tossed in the trash by accident i went about finding a replacement and after looking at a number of products i chose this one based on the price and the positive reviews it has proven to be a good tool a little different than my old scraper but still fine for my needsinstead of plastic this one is stainless steel encased in silicone there are a couple of important factors here first because of the silicone shell the scraping edge is soft and pliable this is helpful for scraping around crevices and getting as much dough from a round plastic bowl as possible  because of the stainless steel inside the whole is stiff though still slightly bendable which allows it to flex just enough to clean the bowl of my stand mixer without fatigue or permanently getting warped or bent it is stiffer than my old plastic scraper and while this is a positive thing it does require getting used to itunlike my old plastic scraper this one will work on a hot saucepan thats good news for when i am making candy and dont want to wait for the syrup to cool and harden requiring a lot more effort to remove i did not find any statement regarding the temperature limit for this scraper but based on other silicone utensils i have it is probably safe up to around 400 degrees fandsilicone is more nonstick than plastic so cleanup is a little easier it was never bad with with my plastic scraper but it did require a bit more effort than this new scraper just because of the nature of the materials of eachim very pleased with this scraper it meets the need i had and it is better than my old plastic scraper that i used for years it works well it can be used on hot or cold cookware and it is very easy to clean its reasonably priced too based on my experience this is a very easy product to recommend,human
this scraper is excellent for baking tasks its silicone edge is soft yet durable making it versatile for various uses,ai
wow i wasnt expecting this dual sided silicone body brush to be as amazing as it is i use the same amount of body wash as usual and lots of soft foam is produced the bristles are soft but very effective even if they dont feel that way at first the other side is nubby and works nicely for feet knees etc its a little heavy but not overly dries quickly and i can even sanitize it,human
this silicone body brush is fantastic producing lots of foam with minimal soap highly recommend it for thorough cleaning,ai
tried the detox via the ion foot bath at a friends house they had a very expensive machine being cheap i looked at various machines and settled on this one works like a champ and glad i bought it because of the 5 yr warranty and being stateside was the clincher have used it many times on a regular basis 2 days on and one off easy instructions cant go wrong i threw in ton of salt to see what would happen alarm went off and reset it use very little salt great product and fast delivery worth it,human

im not totally sure this is helping this whole pandemic thing has messed with everything but the fact that these are a capsule instead of a powder is a winner for me i cant stand the taste of most of those things and just that alone is a turn off i was totally skeptical but while im not sure how much of a benefit they are i can say that they havent caused any negatives so that alone makes them worth a try,human
while im unsure of its full benefits yet the capsule form is a major plus since i dislike powders,ai

the lack of clear instructions made this product difficult to use ill stick to traditional curlers,ai
ive suffered from migraines for about 11 years technically i just get the migraine auras plus strong light sensitivity that irritates my eyes these glasses do help although they arent going to completely fix your problem according to medical studies green light is the easiest light on the eyes and brain for people who suffer from migraines the green tint is soothing reduces how much bright lights normally irritates my eyes and helps to prevent getting a migraine to be clear i get some migraines when wearing these from time to time but they still help in reducing light sensitivity and reducing chance of getting a migraine i also like that it has the green part of the glasses on the side to protect light coming in from your peripheral vision i wear them daily at work when staring the computer all day,human
these tinted glasses reduce light sensitivity and help manage migraines a solid purchase for daily use,ai
who doesnt like bath bombs well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me these bath bombs are great they are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath the fragrances these have are fantastic i tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to plain vanillayou get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over 20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it these come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me i will probably have to get these again when i am out the only one i am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint but that is because i just dont like that fragrance but it will come in handy when i have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses,human
these bath bombs are generously sized and have wonderful fragrances perfect for gifting or selfcare,ai
i had not heard of dmannose and cranberry supplement until a few months ago when i was desperately seeking relief from utis every few months id been taking apple cider vinegar cream of tartar and baking soda which works well but takes too longafter the first sign of another uti i took three of these for 5 days and i stopped having any symptoms from day one it never did turn into a fullblown uti ive been taking one a day ever sinceim so thankful to have found this as utis are so painful and irritating its nice to have something that will help keep them away though this is a bit expensive it works very well i might look for a coupon or shop around when i run out but i would absolutely recommend taking dmannose and cranberry supplements,human
this cranberry supplement provided immediate relief from uti symptoms a bit pricey but worth it,ai

i agree with first reviewer too thick does not appy easily tends to stick to plastic tube applicator tip not metal like muro 128 very bad product not well formulated for humans would not use on the dog either,human
this product is poorly formulated and hard to apply i wouldnt even use it on my dog,ai
this is a huge spatula  i like that it is almost straight indeed i was hoping it would be completely straight up and down unlike a turner  note the picture where i compare this wood spatula to my pink silicone and ss turner that is much more angular  i wanted to have something with a firm base but a straighter design because a friend showed me that her straight up and down wooden spatula puts a lot less stress on the wrists when breaking up big batches of ground beef and shifting them around  i tried to purchase a silicone head straight up and down spatula from le creuset but for my intended use it was a waste of moneynot firm enough and with too narrow of a head  i am really looking forward to using this instead  i do wish that instructions for the proper care of the wood apart from not putting in the dishwasher were included as i am unused to wooden implements  also there are a couple of slight indentations in the wood on the very bottom edge of the spatula this may be customary in natural wood products but i simply dont know if it is  but other than that i am pleasedpotential customers may be interested to note that this is large definitely larger than most turnersspatulas i have previously encountered that the bottom is almost but not quite flatstraight across and that the corners of the bottom curve in ever so slightly in addition to the slight angle of the mostlystraighton head  it can be hard to tell details from pictures  i received this item at a discount in exchange for leaving an unbiased review and i count myself lucky as i had basically been looking for precisely this item,human
this wooden spatula is sturdy and perfect for cooking tasks but lacks proper care instructions,ai

elegant it is and heavy too just a note to make sure the suction pad is tight before hanging the squeegee  it hung best against the glass shower door not so much on the wall  besides its sleek look it functions pretty awesomely with its long length to cover a wide area and the rubber worked well to pull the moisture off the surface  a good squeegee,human
sleek and functional this squeegee works wonderfully on glass but requires a secure suction pad,ai

these syringes are too stiff making it difficult to administer medication accurately,ai
great supplement quality and quick and packaged well,human
a highquality supplement thats wellpackaged and delivers great results,ai
a little too high and deep for a neck pillow for me but works great behind the knees or in front of my other orthopedic pillows to elevate my legs or to ease my spine nicely made no smell soft at the very top but firm at the core very comfortable for knees and legs wide enough for larger than average legs although very large or very heavy legs may wear it out sooner  im a tall gal big gal with longer than average legs its holding up quite well for me after several months nice zippered pillow case  im happy with it  i hope they continue to manufacture these because when this one wears out i will rebuy if you sweat a lot you might want to cover it with a towel to make it last longer this material breaks down in damp and humid air hence it will get flatter sooner so keep it dry,human
while it didnt work as a neck pillow for me its fantastic for leg support and is wellmade,ai
this polisher did exactly what i wanted it to do,human
this polisher met my expectations perfectly highly satisfied,ai

if you must save on space consider these laundry soap sheets  i will be honest though hotel bar soap and baby wash made my clothes smell and therefor feel cleaner to me when doing laundry in the sink  the soap sheets were easier to rinse out than the alternatives but i do appreciate a good sudsing  one time during our trip i ended up with a shirt so stinky after one day on a train and i am not a stinky woman usually that these sheets made the shirt a lost cause  ill blame it on the turkish food but man these things could not keep up  i ended up trying a combination of hand sanitizer bar soap this stuff and downy spray but the initial wash seemed to 34set34 the stink,human
these laundry soap sheets are convenient but struggled with tougher stains on my clothes,ai
neat concept but the design still needs work when working properly it is convenient to have the capability to store snacks in one side or water and a preintraworkout it is however not without flawleaking i have one of the older versions of this shaker and noted leaking as a main issue this was supposed to have been one of the areas of improvement on newer models but its still not perfect yetdurability 1 drop from no more than 2 feet rendered the shaker useless,human
great concept but this shaker still leaks and isnt durable needs improvement,ai
this is the best bum cleaner everim a big girl and gained a bit more weight during the pandemic and started having issues reaching to clean my bum in the shower it wasnt pretty let me yell youi did some searching and comparing and settled on the butt scrubberi handle is long the yellow head is made of some type of silicone and very sturdyi got in the shower and soaped it up and got to work and trust me this device gets in there and cleans everything my cheeks are tight so wrapping a towel around the head is out of the question my bum is much cleaner these dayswhen im finished i soap it up rinse and place it upside down in a container solution of white vinegar and water and let it soak for a whiletrust me your bum will thank you for it,human
this scrubber is a gamechanger for hygiene and works brilliantly highly recommend it,ai
i cant smell this but for just a micro second after spraying it  it initially has a little bit of a bleach smell but then nothing  i sprayed some in my daughters really stinky running shoes and it helped a lot  i could use this in a gallon size since we have pets and stinky tennis shoes  it seems to work as advertised so unless it stops working i think it deserves 5 stars,human

im very happy with this set all four items came individually wrapped and they are all pretty nice quality especially given the price for all of them there were a couple loose stitches here and there but nothing majorthe glove has a cute pattern and a hole on each side of the bottom so it stays on your hand the loofah side feels nice and the exfoliating side actually works it makes my skin feel noticeably smoother after just one use but its not so rough it causes discomfort on my very sensitive skin the back loofah is especially nice and the material is very soft the regular loofah works very well and i actually had to start using less body wash on it because it works up ample lather with just a small amount they all have handles to hang them up to dry overall im happy with this purchase,human

so we called this my husbands leg condom  due to an infection he had his prosthetic knee replacement removed and then six weeks later a new prosthetic knee implanted  this allowed him to shower with his leg restraint on without worry of contaminating the incision or getting his dressings wet  it looks really weird at first with the whole disc thing but it does work and is long enough for even a tall guy to use  it is tight so dont expect to wear it for a long twenty minute shower  highly recommend,human

people take curcumin for the antiinflammation benefit i dont personally notice anything from taking a lot of curcumin from many companies considering the relatively high price for curcumin i would like there to be a more noticeable benefiti measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them which is close to what i expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients it means these capsules have minimal to no fillers which is what they advertiseyou are after the curcumin not the turmeric so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing the current price is 13 for 90 pills which 144gram the 90pill bottle is 094gram the now brand 60 pill bottle costs 033gram the doctors best 120 pill bottle is 034gram nothing about this bleaf nature curcumin would suggest that it is a better product that is worth such a price premium over the established reputable brandsyou can buy tumeric root at the grocery store if that is what you want tumeric is too bulky relative to the active compounds for it to be a good supplement instead focus on supplements that contain just the curcumin extract and ones that contain more of the desired extract than what is in this pillmade in the usa in gmp certified facility,human
while this curcumin supplement contains minimal fillers its overpriced compared to other reputable brands,ai
its honestly so cute i love it i used 7 slots for daily supplements and i use the 8th slot for tylenol,human
i love the compact design of this pill organizergreat for daily use and travel,ai
these are not the quality of others i have bought directly from local pharmacy stores  they will not clean in the earonly around the entrance to the ear canal,human

i bought a package of two because i was trying to approximate the facia blaster not available on amazon at this time and hoped this would work just as well  probably would have been workable except for two things the octopus top has a face and the nose part of the face is pokey when youre grabbing the top and trying to 34blast34 your facia with it  also i had only been working for about 5 minutes when the top of the first one unscrewed and when i tried to screw it back on again these are two piece massagers that you screw the top handle part onto the bottom fingers part it was stripped and would just spin in a circle and come off again  couldnt be secured in place  if this were a solid single piece construction and a smooth knob for the top it would have been a great option for facia blasting  i think ill just end up buying the actual facia blasterupdate  i had been giving up trying to approximate the facia blaster and was about to buy the product but i had been hearing from youtube reviews that it was taking a long time to arrive and i didnt want to stop efforts to blast while waiting waiting waiting  i found a diy facia blaster online and decided to make one and these little guys are just the ticket  hooray  heres a link to the diy project tutorialhttpwwwwellnessgeekycomhomemadefasciablasteralternativediy,human
while the design isnt perfect these massagers are effective for diy fascia treatments,ai
i use these every christmas i used to have a whole bunch of holders and i cant find them was happy to find a kit with 2 holders and 5 scenters a little pricey for my taste but the scent has held up pretty well normally they last about 34 days and then your nose gets used to it,human

i think the use of noise cancelling is a little lost in translation but otherwise these were great and came in really handy  when i travel and am in a secured place its nice to be able to block out all the noise and get some good rest  these did an excellent job  i also used them when going to the shooting range and they worked great there also  having the different sizes meant i had an extra pair to give to someone that didnt have proper ear protection at the range the hard carrying case is great to have as well or i wouldve lost them a long time agoto be noise cancelling they would have to produce a counter noise so the use of that term is incorrect but they do block out a good amount of sound  i was very happy with them and had no problems with them at all,human
these earplugs effectively block sound and come in various sizes great for travel and shooting ranges,ai

i think the frequency works for all pests i dont hear sny more scratching near the attic above my bed but i rarely used the night light and it turns on and then immediately off i have bought 3 and it all does that so glad that the unit itself still works perhaps an led bulb for longetivity,human

i often find myself using my less accurate notouch forehead thermometer to avoid dealing with the sterilization process following the use of an oral thermometer these digital thermometer sleeves work great and about the only issue i have encountered was removing it from its protective packaging without dealing with extra pieces of plastic,human
these thermometer sleeves are convenient and make cleanup quick no mess or fuss,ai
theres not much to describe it is a simple product and i received exactly what i wanted,human
a simple product that met all my expectations highly satisfied,ai
i mean yeah it makes it convenient it is a complete mineral profile i like that about it but sadly it uses inferior forms of some minerals they used calcium carbonate which is one of the most poorly absorbed calciums citrate is what you want as well as magnesium oxide which is also poorly absorbed  you want malate or gycinate that made me a bit disappointed in this product its not too hard to swallow and goes down easy but in the endits not the best,human
while this supplement is convenient it uses less effective forms of minerals disappointed with the formulation,ai
extra fluffy when new and dry but not so much once wet not as good as the original mop heads but still good for the money,human
these mop heads are fluffy when dry but lose volume when wet still decent for the price,ai
it does what is says it will do removes hair painlessly  it does take significant amount of time rubbing it in a circular motion to remove the hair but it does eventually remove the hair and it does not hurt at all unlike waxing or using an epilator  your skin is exfoliated in the process so it is really smooth afterwards  i was able to do one half of my leg from the knee down on the front before my arm got too tired so i will do a little each day after my shower until it is all donebonus it also works on facial hair that i normally get a wax treatment for  i was looking at my lady lip hairs and it reminded me that i need to make an appointment for a wax treatment then saw this device sitting on the bathroom counter and had a lightbulb momentwould this work on my little bit of random lip hair  i had just washed my face so i gave it a try and it worked  again the exfoliation left my skin feeling smooth and soft and no little hairs needing to either be plucked or waxed  because of this along i have upgraded it from 4 stars to 5 stars now i dont need to schedule a wax appointment and have my upper lip swollen and red all day after the waxing like it usually is  i had no irritation at all from this device  saying goodbye to my every couple of weeks painful waxing appointmentsi had my doubts that it would work or if it did remove the hair it would have my sensitive skin very irritated but i was wrong on both parts  it worked and my skin was not harmed at all  kind of a cool device and cost less than a single waxing appointment too,human
this hair removal tool is painless and exfoliates skin but using it takes considerable time and effort,ai

this is a huge urinal for women nothing discreet about this thing i am not going to take it with me at all  i would rather go in the great outdoors instead,human
this urinal is far too large and impractical for travel not discreet at all,ai
not much to say other than these were the size and color i needed,human

these glasses seem to be a wireeh style  they can get easily crushed in man pockets  so im not sure  the frame is too lightweight and lacks the comfort at the ear piece and nose piece  i wanted wider fitting for my big head  so these were good for that purpose  yet when they are on and i am looking thru the glasses i can see the glass frame edges all the time  i since bought another style glasses  and now use these as spares around the house yes they fit around my big head nicely no the lenses are smaller than comfort nose piece is flimsy entire glass frame is flimsy,human
these glasses are lightweight and fit well but feel flimsy theyre now my backup pair,ai
this raveler sleep mask for woman and man contoured with ear plugs is good at blocking out light but lets some light in at the nose area  this is because the nose area is preshaped like the nose area in a halloween eye mask so that the sleep mask doesnt lie completely flat against the nosesleep masks designed with padded fabric across the lower edge of the mask below the eyes and across the nose do a more complete job of blocking out light see eg   however this sleep mask which comes with a set of rubber ear plugs gives good value for the price less than 6 on amazon  it also has a very wide and comfortable elastic band for holding the mask in place while you sleep,human
this sleep mask blocks most light but lets some in near the nose area comfortable and affordable,ai
the band i received from withit was the molded style not decal and is amazing  i get tons of compliments on it  it fits my pebble time perfectly  the colors are exactly as pictured  it matches pretty much everything  highly recommend,human

this heating pad has great temperature control but the wires are noticeable when held still a good product,ai
i am completely new to gua sha techniques so i thought this roller set would be a good entry point and for the most part it is if you are looking for a set that will allow you to learn the techniques at a good and reasonable price point then try these and upgrade to stainless or real jade at some point in the futuremy big gripe about these is that they do feel a little cheap i am not entirely sure that it is real jade and when the roller arrived the larger roller was popped out of place and i had to pop it back in there but it feels really really insecure in there now if the packaging was better this might not have happened thats okay though because i really just wanted the handsculpting too so i can live with the roller not being great if you are buying this for the roller i would look elsewhere otherwise i would recommend this set as a beginnerentry level piece,human
this gua sha set is great for beginners but feels slightly cheap consider upgrading later,ai

i was looking forward to getting this product for review i received a discount because ive had tinnitus for nearly 25 years because ive lived with it for so long im not surprised that this supplement wasnt effective in my case in fact i wouldve been shocked if it had beeni will continue talking these and i will update my review if i notice a difference,human
i had high hopes for this tinnitus supplement but didnt notice any improvement will continue trying it,ai
this item is not as good as advertised i read the research paper the product is based on and the statistics looked decent but i am not one of the people this product worked a miracle on i am back to the old acid blockers this product is worth a try but after one bottle if you feel no improvement do not waste your money on another one,human

this nail care set has everything needed for shaping and smoothing ill definitely buy more,ai
collagen is a part of my daily routine usually in coffee since coffee is part of my daily routineeach packet has 35 calories and 9 g of protein all from cow collagen peptidesunflavored so nothing to interfere or overly sweetenpricier than similar collagens and the serving size is larger than some others as wellstill these are convenient packets for on the go the packets are thoughtfully designed very easy to open no scissors needed,human

ive used a few tens units in the past and can state that this might be the most powerful one ive used though this power comes at the cost a shorter battery life it worked for about 30 minutes out of the box though and when fully charged i got a few hoursthis tens unit charges fairly quickly and provides muscle tensionpain relief so i definitely recommend this devicejust a reminder though that there are warnings online to not place the pads near your heart so id advise not using it on your torso or spinal cord,human
this tens unit is powerful but drains the battery quickly effective for pain relief though,ai
im using these along with a scooter while i recover from a broken ankle  i have arthritis in my shoulders so i this style of crutch works better for me balancing the pressure better for me  these are reasonably priced but still good quality,human
these crutches are great for balancing pressure and are reasonably priced highly recommended,ai
i will keep them because i could can cut a piece of soft fabric moleskin  to line with first but in my opinion this cushion is worse on the sores than the furniture it is protecting against  it is not a soft gel cushion  its more like the scratchy styrofoam peanuts used in packaging  but thicker maybe i can find a gel pad to line it with i have it two stars because i like the netted sleeve  for az heat that is ideal so it has some value to me and  not worth returning but not soft enough to use for bed sores thats for sure,human
this cushion isnt soft enough for bedsores but works okay with added padding the breathable sleeve is a nice touch,ai
its a bit of a mess of cords and such but it makes the flight box wonderful to use compared to batteries i dont even use the batteries any more unless im mobile very nice using it lightly for 3 months no problems or breaks so far,human

i am really pleased that this product came up on my list of items i can review when i saw it i instantly selected it because i know that chlorella is an excellent green superfood i love superfoods and consume them often this one is just chlorella with no spirulina added but if you want both in a capsule its easy to find here on amazon if its only chlorella youre interested in this is a great way to take it i like both the powdered and capsule forms i like the powder for my smoothies but sometimes i dont want a smoothie and the capsules are a great alternative i always feel better and more energized when i consume green superfoods they have a lot of nutrition and naturally occurring minerals there is nothing negative i can find to say about this product,human

fractionated coconut oil is good for making homemade soaps and beauty products but its less potent for hair and body care use  i find the formula thinner but the trade off is that it isnt as greasy and you can still use it for moisturizing your hair and skin without that greasy coconut oil feeling which stains too i have both kinds of oil  the real unprocessed kind for massaging into my hair hands and nails and this kind which is versatile but lacks the smell of coconut but is good as a carrier oil both have their uses and this product is of decent quality  i would just go by price because i dont see any discernible difference between this one and other similarly priced brands of fractionated oil,human
fractionated coconut oil is versatile but lacks the potency of regular coconut oil still great as a carrier oil,ai
works wellstays closed,human

my only complaint with these molds is the size two millimeters is too small for an effective dose  the 2 trays should come in a 5ml  10ml size other than that these are spoton id never made suppositories before  was afraid the caps on the bottom would be hard to remove from the directions they came with but the caps pull off easily no twisting needed the pipettes make it easy to fill the molds without any overflow use the pipettes once then toss them and the individual molds  caps are easy to clean with a qtip dipped in alcohol definitely store your supps in the fridge once you make them  stick them in the freezer for 10 min right before using them to prolong the melting time this kit costs more than a 10pk of natural plantbased supps that youll find online but it lets you make as many as you need based on whatever formula suits your ailment good stuff,human
my only concern with these molds is their size two millimeters is too small for an effective doseoffering trays in 5ml and 10ml sizes would be ideal that said the molds are excellent id never made suppositories before and was worried about the caps being difficult to remove but they pop off effortlessly with no twisting needed the included pipettes make filling the molds messfree the molds and caps are easy to clean with a qtip and alcohol once made store them in the fridge and freeze for 10 minutes before use to extend melting time although pricier than premade options this kit allows you to tailor the formula to your needs highly recommended,ai

couldnt be happier with this purchase  colonics have literally saved my life i was diagnosed with a pelvic floor dysfunction which led me to the inability to have a bowel movement on my own and that undoubtily  led to all sorts of problems health issues and diseases autoimmune lupus chronic fatigue epstein barr hypo thyroid hatchimotos sp fibermyelgia   prior to this i was extremely healthy  my career was in fitness but after years of major constipation at least 30 yrs my 34then34 healthy body couldnt fight off the toxins anymore  i became so toxic and sick  there were days i could hardly get out of bed but when i did  all i could think about was when i could lay back down and take a nap againim a mom of a young family  this unhealthiness was unacceptable buy i was clueless regarding what i could do about it  so i decided to doctor at the world famous mayo clinic with the best docs in the world  after months and months of tests the only thing they could come up with was to remove my colon and live with a colostomy bag the rest of my life  i was so depressed but didnt believe i had any other choice  right before my surgery my husband suggested i go see a naturalpathic doctor to see if they could help me in any way they chose to take me on as their most challenging constipated patient client  a big part of regaining my health was getting professional colonics do you know how expensive those things are between 60100  i was getting one a week for 18 months yes thats how impacted i was i knew this couldnt continue doing this as who can afford a lifestyle of this i sure couldnt on my income my extended family felt so badly for me they would gift me with a colonic a month just to help me out  when they could  but i was still paying thousands out of my own pocket to continue this major cleanse i needed  i thought id eventually have to just give in and use the 34bag34 as it was more 34affordable34  thats when i found out about this colonic board best info ive ever received  changed my life  i ordered it immediately it came in the mail that week and i set it up very simple and went right to work  during my first colonic while using it  i had tears in my eyes  it worked what an answer to prayer  no more having to pay for all those professional colonics  on a side note i just finished a radical 8day detox cleanse and using my colonic board daily was a big part of that   i now feel better than i have in years im not kidding  i lost my bloated weight ive got never ending energy my body nor my joints hurt anymore i cant wait to get out of bed in the mornings im happier  no longer depressed etc  i am forever grateful to my new colonic board that has given me back not only my health but my lifeps  just to warn you ive never met a western medical doctor who has approved of this practice so dont expect them to be jumping up and down on your newfound discovery with you but at the same time ive never met a doctor  nor any person who had as bad of a chronic constipation problem as i had,human
this colonic board has been lifechanging after years of dealing with pelvic floor dysfunction and major health issues this affordable tool has restored my health and saved me from costly professional treatments easy to set up and use it works as effectively as professional colonics im forever grateful for this product,ai
we have a big variety of probiotics that we rotate and use daily  this one has a very impressive label  now i have no way to test any of these claims so i just have to believe them  this one gives more capsules for less money than many others allthewhile giving lots of cfusnot long before the covid19 outbreak i had to take another round of antibiotics  since this wipes out all of the good bacteria in my intestines i stocked up on several different pre  probiotics  my thoughts are that different brands may have different types of good bacteriaafter about two weeks of some serious probiotic dosages which was also in the middle of the covid19 outbreak i got sick  i had a fever cough and shortness of breath  it really started to worry me  it only lasted two days and was gone  i have no proof but i am going to say that my pre and probiotics kept me from getting much sicker and also shortened the duration of my illness,human
this probiotic has an impressive formula offering high cfu counts at a competitive price after consistent use i feel it supports overall gut health especially postantibiotics,ai

this air purifier performs exceptionally well clearing the air in my room within a day even my guinea pigs allergy symptoms disappeared after a week of use saving me a vet bill planning to buy another soon,ai
the brand seems to have changed names twice since ive been using it and the new packaging is the same bottle they have always used but now it is also placed in a sealed heavy plastic bagvery very wasteful and such a poor use of plastic for a company putting out organic items especially they already had a seal on the bottle and the cap is wrapped in a plastic band so the bag is truly wasteful also i believe the mg in each bottle has changed at least twicei believe 3 timesjust seems sketchy since it was not advertised to have changed i only knew by reading the package  that said it seems to work perfectly well i just may start looking for another brand that gives me more confidence and less waste,human
while the product works well the excessive packaging feels wasteful especially for an organic brand the inconsistency in bottle size and milligrams is also concerning although it delivers good results,ai
saw this on insta and immediately bought thru amazon primebetter  but it is terrible  poor qualitypoor instructions and flimsy cord for charging it took forever to heat up and i was terrified that it would tangle my hair i didnt have to worry because it would not wind fullyi returned and treated myself to a curling ironsometimes old school is still the best,human

got this for photo and video shoots where 34wardrobe malfunctions34 cant happen without requiring reshooting  the only thing that will hold outfits in place tighter and not take skin off is doublesided wig tape but it is tough to conceal the tape outline if the fabric is thin  this is in the middle of the spectrum between heavy duty 34stickum34 sprays and the wig tapefour stars instead of 5 because the applicator tip is less than ideal  this product used to come packaged like a 34glue stick34 which seemed to be less messy than the applicator tip that come on this one,human

i have been taking 10000 mcg biotin supplements daily for many years to help with hair and nail health this vita mountain product has calcium in it as well and i am not sure why they added that ingredient as far as quality i have no reason to score this less than five stars for actual purchasing i would go with whatever is cheapest which is often natrol or nutricost i am unaware of any notable differences between the brands,human

this is useful and seems durable its replacing a similar cane i bought a year ago which bent but that was a different design for the leg and seemed less durable i hope this one will last i use a different cane in the summer but find it useful to have a light on the cane in the winter when i have to see ice and snow to walk the flashing red light is very useful for crossing the street at night the alarm might not seem like a great idea but lets be honest there are people who attack cripples and i ended up needing the alarm only 2 days after i got the cane when i was randomly attacked near my homei get a lot of compliments on it from people who are impressed with the idea of a cane with lights built in,human
this cane is sturdy and functional with builtin lights and an alarm for added safety its great for winter use when visibility is critical highly recommend,ai

been using this since our baby was a newborn although i know this company was under some scrutiny a while ago i still think this is a great product we havent really had much diaper rashes but when we did this took care of it its a thicker consistently when the tube is new but over time it can become more liquidy especially in warmer temperatures and it turns to like an oil so best to keep in a cooler place also sometimes when the tube gets really old and low there are some grainy things im not sure if thats because the product has dried out a bit overall i think this is a good diaper rash ointment or preventative ointment it also goes on clear so you babys butt isnt covered in like white,human
ive used this since my baby was a newborn and its been effective for preventing and treating diaper rashes while it thickens over time and can become oily in warmer temperatures it works well overall store in a cool place for best results,ai

nice unit  except the bracket is too narrow to hold waterpic and similar showerheads which renders it useless for metoo bad really that the distributor and manufacturer dont take the time to let potential purchasers know this because they refuse to take returns on this itemtoo bad really because the unit is otherwise acceptable the suction cup adheres well and the bracket allows a fair range of adjustment gfor the showerhead  if you have one that fits the bracketjerry,human

normally i just love gummy vitamins but these dont taste very good  i like the vitamins and omega3s they contain all that is very good  they just dont taste good  i immediately get a fishy flavor got to be from the algae they are made from followed by some serious tartness  though they are still palatable why consume these when there are other gummy vitamins that are just as good and taste a lot better  if you dont mind tartness and a little fishy flavor then i highly recommend these,human
while the vitamins and omega3s in these gummies are beneficial the fishy and tart taste makes them less appealing,ai

the shiatsu massager provides a deep relaxing massage with strong rollers and a heat option its perfect for pain relief but must be plugged in to use,ai
in short open reservoir cup makes it easy to add water keep clean and to allow dry between uses can adjust strength slim design makes it easy to maneuver around mouth takes up little room can be packed up for on the go use loud but similar to my corded tank stylei use water flossers all the time the best to me is a particular name brand that has a tank and is plugged in i keep that in my main bathroom that has a plug nearby since i rely greatly on water flossing i wanted to have one in my 1st floor bathroom which is like the size of a closet and has no counter and no plugs so i have been tried cordless flossers for use in that bathroomhere is the thing i find with most of them the water reservoirs are bulky and are hard to clean i dont care that they dont hold much water that is easy enough to deal with but to have an enclosed cup that really can ever be cleaned out gross then i tried one where there  and that works really well for my needs that one wins out over this due to one aspect it is fully cordless when i saw this hangsun water flosser i decided to try itit has appearance of regular plug in but an open water top that makes me feel better about it drying between uses i didnt need another flosser but i wanted to find out more about it and report back in a reviewso this may be for you if you are like me in wanting a cordless flosser with an open water reservoir i can easily add more water to it it is easy to clean and it dries between uses charge has been long lasting so i like that i dont need to fuss it is nice for use in noplug areas while cordless i still feel attached as i need to set the base down doubt i would use this in shower with my other one i may need to supply my own cup for water but it can be any size and i can use it in shower just by cupping my handkinda loud similar to my plug in name brand onei tend to only ever use one head the slightly curved one havent tried the other options and likely wontof the half dozen cordless flossers i have tried including a name brand cordless i like this one and the one i linked to the best i use them secondary to my plug in,human
this cordless water flosser is easy to clean and maneuver making it ideal for small spaces though slightly noisy its a great alternative to tankstyle flossers,ai
im a big fan of mint and a big fan of chocolate  many see girl scout thin mints as the apex of chocolatemint cookiedom but i was looking for something more  i think ive found it in these york peppermint pattie cookies  the cookies consist of a chocolate cookie covered with mint creme and dipped in chocolate  heres whats so great about them  first these cookies are dipped in dark chocolate which i personally prefer to milk chocolate  second they have a nice layer of mint creme which gives a nice texture compliment to the crunchy cookie  third the mint creme is a true strong peppermint great for those who love their mint  overall this is a great cookie  id happily munch one anytime,human

this milk was better before the addition of guar gum which makes it too thick i prefer the original version great for liver health and weight management,ai

these camera batteries last as long as the original and are invaluable for outdoor trips a worthwhile purchase,ai
received the device a couple of days ago  stumbled around a little bit to get the hang of it but its easy when you know what you are doing  purchased this one because of the many positive reviews  good choice  im just wearing it now to see how i do normally  i cant believe i am such a low stepper  no wonder ive seen a weight gain  darn the reality of sitting at a computer all day  when you can 34see34 for yourself what you are doing or more importantly not doing it really is a motivator  grandma was slow but she was old  i hope to reverse some of that old saying,human
this step tracker is a great motivator helping me visualize my activity level and set goals for improvement easy to use,ai
i got this free at cvs using extra bucks but that price still seems too high mine had no mechanical problems and the vibrations were pretty strong it shook the entire table which makes me wonder if it should be containing that vibration and channeling it into the jewelry more efficiently its important to note that the cvs price was only 799 and i got it half off after christmas for basically four bucks i tried it first with just warm water no change my jewelry still had some grime then tried with a drop of dawn same result the photo in my review is after two cycles the debris in the lid is from dropping it while trying to open it that wasnt actually removed by the device i also experienced difficulty removing the lid but i was able to get it apart with just my hands save your money dont get it,human
while this jewelry cleaner vibrates strongly it didnt effectively remove grime save your money and look for a better option,ai
i cannot tell if its picking up anything dirt is still there after spraying and wiping it smells great though,human
this cleaner has a pleasant scent but doesnt effectively remove dirt not worth it,ai
prosecure fitcomfortable to wear4 layersconscannot think of any,human

i was hoping this was the original formula but it is not i used this detergent with my last 2 kids so i know the smell of it and this one is not the same i loved the old smell which last longer on the clothes after washing this one fades away i can barely smell it after the clothes come out of the washer also the original formula is much more concentrated therefore you only need to use a little bit i used more with this one as for packaging it arrived well packaged in plastic so there was no leak,human
this detergent isnt the original formula and lacks the longlasting scent and concentration i expected disappointed,ai
works exactly as advertised zero smoke  not sure how long it lasts but out of the package id call it a miracle product  surprise bonus was the smoke buddy keychain great entertainment posing him after using the smoke buddy,human
this smoke eliminator works flawlessly with no odor the included keychain is a fun bonus,ai
when i decided to order them i must have misread the directions  once i received them i discovered that the daily amount is three  that  means a package is a twenty day supply  to me that is too expensive and the taste really isnt that great  i didnt take them long enough to determine how helpful they will be,human
the daily dosage of three makes this supplement expensive and the taste isnt great i wont repurchase,ai

i purchased this scale on april 10 2016 today is may 16 2017 and my scale no longer works i changed the batteries when they died and now when you stand on the scale it says scanning step off thinking and then err like many others i reset the scale reset it up left batteries out etc i sought out the help page on fitbit 5 pages of people with the same problem no response from fitbit i am very angry that my 13 month old 123 scale no longer works i just bought a 17 digital scale to replace this bad show fitbit6117 update fitbit reached out to me and sent me a replacement scale no charge after we tried a few things to reboot my original scale their customer service has been fantastic and was wonderful to work with i really appreciate the good faith and of course the new scale i will gladly purchase their products again,human
while the fitbit scale initially stopped working after a year the company replaced it promptly with excellent customer service id buy from them again,ai
i received this set undamaged and in good working order i tried the different heads included and have to say that it definitely works as intended you are using electricity so please follow all safety guidelines and do not use it for things it was not intended much like a tens unit this unit sends current into the skin at its lowest settings you merely feel a slight pleasant vibration i lack the courage to try it at its highest setting because it would surely give a pretty significant jolt in between those extremes there are several settings that create a good working base for a variety of uses for instance it gives instructions on aging or delicate skin when applying serums and when trying to alleviate painthe booklet is pretty clear on its warnings suggestions and instructions the box it came in has a magnetic closure dense foam to cradle the different fragile glass heads and the unit itself it will take some experimentation with to find the optimum level of comfort and efficacy,human
this skincare device delivers gentle vibrations and offers multiple settings for a variety of uses follow the safety guidelines for the best experience,ai
butter no pecan blcch,human
this product tastes like butter but lacks any pecan flavor not enjoyable,ai
its not bad i havent felt any results as others have so i am going on faith that it will deliver benefits over time you must mix it with berries or something the taste by itself is a little rustic for me i make it as a keto smoothie with some heavy whipping cream fruit water a touch of stevia doable,human
the taste of this powder is earthy and requires mixing with berries or sweeteners to be palatable results are subtle but promising,ai
its much thinner than i was hoping for but should do the trick if i double or triple layer it  but that will only make the usable length 13 what is listed,human
the material is thinner than expected so doubling it up is necessary works okay overall,ai
just as shown and just as stated the suction cups could be better but the price was right,human

was having good success with bulletproof stress gummies but they contained malitol so i started looking for a viable substitute  this brand seemed pretty close  same sensoril ashwagandha just more same ltheanine a little more b6 plus the addition of gaba and magnesiumi find this blend helps with anxiety that started for me with perimenopause  the kind of irrational anxiety that you know is just anxiety  the sudden dwelling on all things bad  stressful the sense of impending doom  this blend helps a lot with that  i also find it useful as my brains leans toward overstimulation  i probably would have been labeled autistic as a 70s child had it been a thing  my brain does not shift gears well  it is not good at surprises  although i cope and try to be rational when hubs asks me to do something suddenly my brain just wont let me sometimes  i call it my gears jamming  this supplement helps that  it backs my brain down of the ledge and makes me think reasonably againoverall  super pleased with these  they are just what i was looking for,human
this stress relief supplement has a wellrounded formula that effectively eases anxiety and improves focus highly recommend,ai

this antimotion sickness oil is simple natural and highly effective a musthave for travel,ai
you cant expect quality products if its super cheap especially organic acerola i take the acerola tabs but sometimes i rather just mix it in my drinks this is very tart so i recommend mixing it with juice and also using a whisk it can clump very easily it really does give me energy im very sensitive to caffeine so this is a great alternative to energy drinks doesnt mess with my glucose levels and i dont crash on this the benefits of acerola are amazing and i recall hardly getting sick living in puerto rico because we had a large acerola tree in our back yard my mom use to juice them and we ate them as a family on a daily basis miss that tree,human
this tart acerola powder is energizing and a great alternative to caffeine mix with juice to reduce clumping fantastic for overall health,ai

this review is more to clarify someone elses review bc they didnt understand understand the labeling  it shows 1000mg as advertised  another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium  i realize not everyone takes chemistry but 4 ppl liked his review  so misinformation is spreading  this works if however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr  ask for a medication called linzess which works must better  must faster but is unnecessary for most people  if magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food  drink 68 glasses of water per day  staying hydrated will really help  before switching to linzess i used to take one 1000 mg pill am  pm every day with meals  always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid,human
this magnesium supplement works well but requires proper hydration for effectiveness consult a doctor if stronger solutions are needed,ai

i mixed a heaping scoopful in some cold filtered water and it took some stirring but finally seemed to dissolve  it turned the water a beautiful cherry red but it did not taste like cherries  it tastes a lot like beets since beets are the primary ingredient and i could detect the flavor of the soil they were grown in  ive grown organic beets in my raised beds and i never could get the dirt taste completely out of them so im not complaining  as far as sweetness goes there was very little despite it being sweetened with stevia  i will be putting this into my smoothies and kefir smoothies from now on since its flavor is not all that good but the ingredients are top notch,human

these really arent too shabby the cleaning sheets are as expectedi read through the product description before ordering  i think i have used something similar in the past as it felt rather intuitive to use just add a sheet to water it instantly dissolves i think 1 sheet per gallon give or take can be stuffed into a cleaning bottle for a spray solution or can be added to a bucket smells nice works well small pressure zip plastic packaging little footprint really no wastei have used it primarily on counter tops and tubs while it mentions floors and walls i just use it as a basic cleanerseems gentle enough my rag picks up a lot of dirt so i know it is effective current price of 5 for 30 sheets makes this a budget friendly option especially if looking for something that doesnt take up much space or plan to use it in a spray bottle of course there are liquid concentrates that would offer same but hey i thought it worth pointing outi really think it is an ok productlack of directions is a concern though i dont mind information in another language other than english if i cant figure it out then using a translator app i pass my phone over it  odd thing is there arent any instructions the most info you get on this product is what you see here on the product page there is no workable information printed on the package so i dont down rate because of the info not being in english i down rate because there simply is no info i will include a picture of the translated text but even so i think nearly anyone couldshould be able to figure this product outwatersoluble cleaning sheet concentrated cleaning sheet will quickly dissolves upon contact with water and is immediately ready for your cleanup jobi do  like these cleaning sheets i clean homes for a living and while i dont always need my own cleaners i do keep a few in my tool kit having the option of mixing something up on the go and having no added weight or mess to carry around is highly appealing  i would even tear off half a sheet and add it directly to a toilet it does dissolve instantly easily and smells good and fresh not too strong no need to rinselovely product overall 4 stars,human
these cleaning sheets are great they dissolve instantly in water and i use them for countertops and tubs theyre budgetfriendly and easy to carry making them convenient for cleaning on the go however there are no instructions included which is a bit of a downside,ai

this is a nice ice roller it rollsspins without effort and doesnt stick even when very cold compared to another i have this handle is easier to hold as its made for a normal grip i have another one where the handle is somewhat triangle shaped the freezer case is especially nice as you can store it without worry of food contact it doesnt take up much room in the freezer i recommend this model,human
this ice roller is fantastic it rolls easily doesnt stick even when very cold and has a handle thats easy to grip the freezer case is great too as it keeps the roller safe from food contact and doesnt take up much space,ai

this sleep mask is one of the most adorable ones ive ever seen it has a 3d effect because the floppy ears are attached separately to the mask and jut out its really cute and would be appreciated by dog lovers as well as fans of the disney movie the price is a little high for this type of thing but otherwise its a fun sleep mask especially for children now if only they made a cat version based on the aristocats,human
this sleep mask is one of the most adorable ones ive ever seen the floppy ears give it a 3d effect making it perfect for dog lovers or disney fans its a little pricey but overall its a fun and cute sleep mask especially for kids i wish they had a cat version too,ai

we needed a first aid bag for our dog and this one is perfect its spacious and exactly what we needed,ai
this freshcap unwind instant drink mix tastes very good  its slightly sweet and no where near being too sweet  some people may want to add a little more sweetener to it  i mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it completely dissolved leaving no mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup  it nearly has the color of coffee and when i added a little cream to it it looked exactly like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but without the caffeine  the product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix i guess that means reishi and chaga but it doesnt say per serving  nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving  im assuming that you get 1000 mg of reishi and chaga per tube  i looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules i have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so i guess one tube also contains 1000 mg  overall i think this is a good product especially useful right before bedtime to promote a better nights sleep and it tastes good too,human
the freshcap unwind instant drink mix tastes delicious its not too sweet and dissolves perfectly in hot water leaving no sediment it has a coffeelike color and flavor but without the caffeine making it ideal for bedtime the product is effective though i wish the serving size details were clearer,ai
i do not often eat nutrition bars but when i need to these are the ones i select  they are not too sweet chock full of good little crunchy things and priced well  i cannot find them in retail stores even tho i shop at organic groceries and wonder why they are not more widely available,human

but i dont get a lot of support from it for your knee you need more support than what this brace offers the side supports are not metal they are a plastic and bend easily enough i dont fight the fit to be very good and am disappointed in this knee brace,human
this knee brace doesnt provide adequate support for those needing more stability the side supports are made of plastic rather than metal which makes them bend easily the fit is also not ideal leaving the user disappointed in the overall quality of the product,ai
i have used sea moss gummies before  but i must admit that i was a little scared to try the real thing  since i like to keep my diet in the raw as much as possible  i decided to give this a shot  honestly  its basically tasteless  it has a very faint oceany flavor that i barely notice  if i put it in a smoothie  i dont notice it at all  the texture reminds me of chia seed jam  it works really well as a thickener in smoothie bowls and pudding if you are gluten free  its a good way to thicken soups as well  the serving size is very low so this bag should last a long time,human
a decent product for those looking to incorporate sea moss into their diet the flavor is subtle and not overwhelming and it works well as a thickener in smoothies and soups the serving size is small making this a longlasting option however the taste and texture may not appeal to everyone,ai
i had given her mom one previously but she said she had never seen it because mommy keeps everything for herself that is a 12 year olds opinion so i got her this one and if she cant get those blackheads our of her face with the machine then she use the tools that are included,human
the tools included with this blackhead remover set may be a practical backup if the machine doesnt work as expected while the previous product may not have worked for the mom the new one seems to be a more effective option its a solid product for those who want an additional way to manage blackheads,ai
always use them extra soft,human
the extra softness of these products is a notable feature providing comfort during use their effectiveness is likely tied to the gentle quality they offer,ai
i found that this traction device is of the utmost highest quality than all the rest also if you have any questions you can contact the company and they will assist you  my surgery liked it so good the he was going to recommend it to his other patients  it is easy to adjust up and down and very comfortable as much as traction can be i have tried several others and this is by far the best for a soft traction device,human
this traction device stands out for its superior quality compared to others it is comfortable to use and adjustable offering good support during traction sessions the companys customer service is an added bonus making it a reliable choice for anyone needing a traction device,ai
i used it maybe 10 times and it stopped working i used a small torx screwdriver and took the screw out of the bottom and used a small flat screw driver to put in the slot to slide the cutter head off of the plastic base i took my old razor head tabs broke off like everyone elses and compared and they are very similar but whatever grease they are using fails pretty quickly and becomes sticky causing the hair to get stuck i suppose you could clean their grease off and use a white lithium grease or something and it would work fine but i just decided to swap my old oem cutter head into the new plastic base works great now,human
while this product initially stopped working it was easy to fix with a few simple adjustments after swapping the cutter head the device worked well again the grease used in the mechanism is suboptimal causing issues with hair getting stuck but can be remedied with alternative greases,ai
45these zep cleaners that came in the zep cleaning bundle work perfectly just like brand names if not better than somethis bundle comes with an all purpose cleaner and a streak free glass cleaner the all purpose cleaner is a degreaser as well and it works brilliantly we had grease splatter on the stove top and i was dreading the clean up but figured it would be a great test for this stuff i gave it a spray let it sit for 60 seconds attempted a wipe up and wow the grease came right up i was impressed i wasnt 100 in love with the smell but the cleaning power sold methe glass cleaner i would definitely say is in line with other blue glass cleaners it only streaked if i wiped it really poorly i can streak any windowmirrorglass surface imaginable i am so bad at that it had the normal smell that you would expect i liked it a loti thought both these cleaners were very good im not sure about the price and how it compares to other cleaners though even though i definitely recommend these for their cleaning power i did have to take just a tad off for the slightly higher cost,human
the zep cleaning bundle offers great cleaning power particularly with the allpurpose cleaner which easily tackles grease and other messes the glass cleaner is also effective but may require better technique to avoid streaks the price point is a consideration but the cleaning results justify the cost,ai
i ordered this because i have a hip replacement coming up and after checking out the walkers medicare would provide for me decided this is a much better option while ive only tried it out so far i am pleased with its appearance and solidity it is very sturdy and with the back wheels being further apart than are the front wheels there is more room for me another feature that i really like is that i can pull up on the strap in the middle of the seat and fit it through a narrow bathroom door while still using it for support while this is a heavy nylon seatand not paddedit and the back fit me well and provide solid lumbar support someone else looked at it today and was quite impressed she said they paid over 500 for a walker for her brother that was flimsy with metal that quickly bent so that the thing was useless she plans to get one of these for her mother the only downside seems to be that the included cupholder cant be put on without loosening a strangelooking screwwe have to find a screwdriver that will fit it a cane holder is also included the velcroattached bag is good sized if you want to go to the hassle of removing 8 screwgizmos with large plastic heads they are easy to do and lower the arms it will fit in the included bag,human
a solid walker option especially for those anticipating a hip replacement its sturdy easy to adjust and provides good lumbar support the only downside is the cupholders installation difficulty but this is a minor issue considering the overall quality and value,ai
perfect we need this because the toilet is very low good product,human
a helpful addition for low toilets this product provides the necessary support for easier use simple yet effective it meets the need it was designed for,ai
this is the 56th bp monitor that i have tried and ordered through amazon either via purchase or the vine program and is a basic monitor almost every single monitor takes my bp within a few points of each other and this ones accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors this one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user note that i did not take 180 readings so this is unverified after the reading it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse it averages the bp after three successful bp readings but the average recall is not marked as an average most monitors identify an average with the avg notation it has an irregular heartbeat indicator  there is one large cuff provided that will fit most people there are two power options available and included and that is four aaa batteries or via a usb type c cable time settings are in the 24hour clock military time only voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy chinese accentincluded in the package one bp unit one bp user manual and one digital pamphlet one large cuff one cloth carry pouch one usb type c cable and 4 aaa batteriesfeatures up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory date and time settings are available in 24hour clock only setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual the lcd display readout is large for easy reading the cuff is 22 to 42 cm 866 to 16535 inches which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese clearing all the bp settings is just a matter of holding the mem button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until all ee appears the display is large accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors press and hold the set button when power is off wait until the user indicator blinks and then press mem to switch to the other user it displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such it has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female chinese accentnegatives the cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance the average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the avg indicator what happens is that after three readings the first number displayed is the average the next three numbers and beyond are the readings once i cycle through all the readings the average is never displayed again unless i turn off the unit and then press the memory button again the voice option is moderated by a heavy female chinese accentthis is an acceptable bp monitor operation and setup of this unit is simple once i read the manual to take my blood pressure i affixed the cuff around my left arm with my palm turned up i made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor then i pressed start and after a little bit i had my reading i pressed stop to turn off the unit the systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayedblood pressure is never the same from moment to moment so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes it is important for a user to learn how to take their bp to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when in fact it is user error there are many great videos online that can help teach thisin summary this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual the cuff is large enough for most people and the lcd display is large and easy to read it displays an avg after three readings but that is not marked the voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented the current price is not listed but any price at 24 or below would be reasonable for thisfor those who are interested i attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5star monitors these monitors i consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others i tested i listed two 4star monitors because they have unique features such as spanish speaking or bluetooth each one of these monitors is accurate and i would highly recommend any of them  this is known as the gold standard of bp monitors it stores 100 readings between 2 users it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an ac adapter can be purchased separately the arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people   this is the monitor i use most often in the winter so i do not have to disrobe to expose my arm it stores 120 readings between 2 users it is great for portability comes with a hard case and is battery operated in addition it has cp g correct position guidance to ensure the user does not make an error that only works if it is turned on accuracy is spot on which is atypical of wrist monitors   this is great if a talking monitor in both english and spanish is needed it stores 120 readings between 2 users in addition to battery operation it comes with an ac adapter two very flimsy cuffs and a case if the cuffs were better this would be my favorite arm monitor  this is a great monitor with a large cuff two power sources 4 aaa batteries or ac cable and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each 45 stars  this monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes the lcd display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green yellow and red based on the hypertension levelwhich is excellent there are two power options it takes four aaa batteries or a usb type c cable both are included there is an average feature after two readings there are date or time settings in ampm not military time the cuff size is large there is an irregular heartbeat indicator accuracy is spot on   this is one unique monitor the monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the ios or android app vihealth the cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small operation is simple this is rechargeable and comes with the usb type c cable for charging there is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app there is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app in fact the readings can be associated with multiple users number and amount unknown the date and time are automated through the bluetooth pairing with the app as of june 2022 the app is quirky and does not always connect the bp unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone the  is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulationtens option both are 4 stars  this monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes the lcd display is large and easy to read there are two power options of either four aa batteries not included or a microusb cable included there is an average feature after two readings there are date or time settings in 24hour clock military time only the cuff size is large and will fit most users there is also voice broadcast mode and two alarm options this does not have an irregular heartbeat indicator  45 stars,human
this blood pressure monitor is a reliable choice for those who need accurate readings at home the features are straightforward though the voice assist could be improved with clearer pronunciation the units memory capacity and ease of use make it a solid option for everyday monitoring,ai
did not work  i returned this item,human
unfortunately this product did not meet expectations and was returned it was likely not a good match for the intended use,ai
i had high hopes for this as i suffer from neck pain that radiates up into my head at times may be stress maybe misalignment not sure but it didnt help me with my problem its possible it needs to be used for a longer period of time to get any results but its very uncomfortable and a few times i felt  like it almost made it worse maybe it was just not  a good match for my problem but for my personal experience i cannot say it helped,human
while this product is meant to alleviate neck pain it didnt offer the expected relief the discomfort experienced while using it suggests that it may not be a suitable solution for everyone particularly for those with misalignment issues or stressrelated pain,ai

just received this and so far love it it had a charge but i charged it overnight in my phone charger and used every accessory the next day it still had plenty of power left 1520min of playing around with it no pain with any and the facial hair remover worked great no redness or hair seen 2 days later im 53 dark haired with light complexion the nose trimmer piece came apart when i went to put it on and it was tricky putting it back together but i eventually got it not my favorite to use but it works not sure about the eyebrow trimmer but i didnt buy it for that i didnt try the body shaver as i had shaved my legs  underarms that day so far i am very happy with this purchase and feel its a great buy overall would definitely recommend,human
overall this product performs well with various accessories especially the facial hair remover the nose trimmer could be better in terms of assembly but it functions fine once reassembled though not perfect this product offers good value for money and has earned a positive review,ai

i think weve used about every wipe there is to use between the 3 of my children8 months to 5 years with newborns pampers was my choice i had to change diapers often and they worked great at working against diaper rash admittedly though as my children got older we gravitated toward huggies wipes pampers seems to have different kinds of wipes there was one kind that seemed so slimy we couldnt bear to use it and it seemed that no matter how hard we tried we ended up with that particular one we keep wipes just about everywhere and use them on our hands tooparticularly during car rides we prefer huggies when it comes to hand usethese are great though when it comes to backsides they are a little more on the slimy side than huggies but these are more durable with huggies wipes theyre constantly tearing or we end up pulling out 4 wipes stuck togetherthese seem to come apartfrom each othermuch better you can tug and pull on these and see just how much more durable they are we generally have better coupons from pampers so we usually end up with pampers wipes ill be honest though and say that when we have the coupons we get huggies wipes we like them both for different reasons we only use one of the two though from my experience and opinion just forget generic brands when it comes to wipesif your little one has a sensitive backside though i highly recommend these these are scented so if that bothers you theres the unscented sensitive kind too,human
pampers wipes are preferred for newborns but huggies is favored as children get older especially for hand use pampers wipes are more durable though both brands are liked for different reasons,ai

i have tried a few different versions of neck traction devicesneck stretchers and have found they all are quite similar with some slight variations in size and designthis one is slightly smaller than others something that works well for me at 54 like the others it is not soft despite what it may look like the foam is very hard as its intended to be in order to support your head and neck and to provide a thorough stretch there are also some pressure nodes on the device which are really just bumps in the foam but are positioned to provide a bit of acupressure and massage while youre lying on it personally i dont notice the bumps but its possible theyre doing their jobif youre new to this type of neck device know that it takes a while to get used to it when i first started it was quite painful and i managed only a couple of minutes at a time now i use it once or twice a day for about ten minutes at a time the benefits are immediately noticeable as it relieves the tension in my neck and shoulders that always develops after a day spent at my computerthis particular device unlike others i have used comes with a zippered carryingstorage bag as well as an eye mask and ear plugs none of these are crucial to the neck traction device but are nice extras some reviewers noted a bad smell when they received their device i had no such issues with mineif  youre looking for a way to relieve neck and shoulder pain without resorting to medication this is definitely worth a try,human
this neck traction device is helpful in relieving neck and shoulder pain but may be uncomfortable at first the extra accessories like a carrying bag eye mask and earplugs are a nice bonus,ai

after weighing 250 pounds for the last six yearsincluding during periods when i ate less andor increased my exercise and lost no weight i have dropped to 230 in only three months using mcg i eat whatever i wantalthough i am dramatically less hungry than i ever used to be and i have virtually no cravings for sweets unheardof for me and i am not exercising at all just as a matter of documentation im 46 and 64i have 30 more pounds to lose and the only reason this is a fourstar review instead of a 5star review is that my weight loss does appear to have stopped its been difficult to find clear guidance on whether its safe to take more of the supplement and if so how much more and that too is frustrating i dont know anything about other brands of this stuff although i saw a consumer something or other report in which a couple of the other 34top34 brands were found by laboratory analysis to have either less or none of the active ingredient in them this particular brand was not included in that study at allim not brand loyal by any meansi dont give a darn who makes it and am more than happy to switch if i find a cheaper manufacturerbut i have stuck with miracle because it worked at least this far and i still have three bottles leftto those who tried this and had no benefit i dont know what to say other than that i am sorry for your lack of results i regularly eat steak chicken salmon and halibut rice homemade pasta quality cheese organic fresh fruits and veggies dry roast almonds homemade ice cream and homemade cherry pie a no sugar added recipe for the latter and i drink about 2 cups of twinings green tea every day as i said about i find im hungry for and thus just comfortably eat much less of these foods at eat sitting than ever before and have been happy to do so the supplement is expensive but i have saved a ton of money taking dinner leftovers to work for lunch the next dayassuming i continue to have curbed cravings and reduced appetite and assuming my weight loss resumes soon i really couldnt be happier its hard for me to imagine that this is just a fluke after trying to budge my weight unsuccessfully for six years and then lose 20 pounds in 90 days will it all come back ifwhen i stop taking the supplement is the supplement safe to take longterm to keep my weight down if the cravings return as far as i can tell nobody knows yetif anybody cares ill be happy to post an update as time continues to pass today is may 25 2014,human
after maintaining a weight of 250 pounds for six years including times when i ate less or exercised more without seeing any weight loss ive dropped to 230 pounds in just three months using mcg i eat whatever i want though im much less hungry than before and i no longer crave sweets which is rare for me im not exercising at all for context im 46 years old and 64 tall i have 30 more pounds to go and the only reason this is a fourstar review instead of five is that my weight loss seems to have plateaued its hard to find clear guidance on whether its safe to take more of the supplement or how much which is frustrating im not loyal to any particular brand but have stuck with miracle because its worked for me so far and i still have three bottles left to those who didnt see any benefits im sorry to hear that ive been eating steak chicken salmon rice homemade pasta quality cheese fresh fruits and veggies and other homemade foods and find that im eating much less of these foods now the supplement is pricey but ive saved money by taking leftovers for lunch assuming my cravings stay under control and weight loss resumes im really happy with the results after six years of struggling with weight losing 20 pounds in 90 days seems like progress,ai
i really like this brand of contact lens cleaner works the best for me,human

so this is not regular powdered horsetail like you would normally buy  this is 7 so that means they add extra extract which is going to make this stronger and extremely bitter since i eat my herbs like food i dont want this extra extract added to it  the taste is overwhelming and bitter  plus its not green  good fresh dried horsetail powder is supposed to be green  this is also from china  i normally get my powdered horsetail grass from starwest herbs and its organic and from croatia and tastes wonderful and fresh  this stufftastes gross wrong color not organic and from china  i bought this because it was cheaper than the starwest so i thought id give it a try  but totally not worth it  you get what you pay for  im going back to the more expensive horsetail from starwest which is exactly the way horsetail is supposed to look and taste  i like bulksupplements normally  for supplements and amino acids vitamins minerals and chemicaltype stuff  i highly recommend bulk supplements for vitamins and supplements their quality is good and the price is excellent  for herbs i would recommend starwest or frontier  definitely not bulksupplements,human
this isnt your typical powdered horsetailits 7 extract meaning its stronger but also very bitter i prefer a milder taste and didnt like the added extract its also not green like fresh horsetail powder should be this ones from china whereas i usually buy from starwest herbs which sources organic horsetail from croatia and it tastes much better although bulksupplements is great for vitamins and amino acids id recommend starwest or frontier for herbs over this product,ai
works well,human
this product works well,ai

purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder  it is less messy than regular powder however it doesnt work as well  and it is oddly greasy  he reports that it is lotiony in a weird way  since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry  if its lotiony or greasy not so muchif youre hoping for a replacement for powder  this isnt it  at least in my husbands opinion,human
i bought this for my husband to avoid the mess of regular powder but while it is less messy it doesnt work as well he said it feels greasy which isnt ideal for keeping areas dry this product isnt a good substitute for powder in his opinion,ai

after using this air purifier for a week ive had no odor from the litter box its nearly silent and the only indicator its on is a soft blue light its worth the price for odor management though i cant confirm its effectiveness against germs if you have pets this is a great choice,ai

so far my husband loves this dental plaque remover this is not going to take the place of your dental hygienist but it will help maintain in between my husband has crooked teeth so this helpsthe instructions are pretty much nonexistent so that is huge minus when it comes to this product you would basically have to figure it all out on your ownoverall the product seems to work but time will tell just need to have better instructionsnote take off the flimsy rubber tips first,human

my husband said he was not impressed by this flavor and it took a lot to get a hint of the orange he did say he got a hit of orange creamsicle taste but it too a great deal of the product to get that hint also this product is not part of prime and the shipping cost was more then the price i paid so not a great bargain unless you were to buy many more flavors this is not the first capella flavor he has tried and while they indeed taste like the descriptions it takes a great deal more product to achieve then other brands now this is in reference to using it to make homemade vape juice and im sure if using for food purposes the flavor would be must stronger all in all its just ok and will not be ordering again,human
my husband wasnt impressed with the orange flavor it took a lot of product to taste the orange and the flavor was subtle the shipping cost more than the product itself which wasnt a great deal unless you buy multiple flavors its okay but i wont reorder,ai
acai is great if you want to reduce your appetite if you eat for pleasure then it might not work as well i found that in two months of taking this supplement i didnt lose a great deal of weight as reported in some reviews but i did see dramatic results in the clarity and radiance of my skin this supplement contains powerful antioxidants which protect the cells from free radicals so if you are interested in skin health then i can recommend this to you for me it hasnt helped me lose weight in a dramatic way as advertised in many blogsthe rebecca review,human

these socks are great the fabric is soft smooth lovely feels really nice next to my skin i love how colorful  fun these compression socks are because all ive found up until now were just drab tan black or white stockings that looked hideous just because i have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities feet calves doesnt mean i want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose these are so cute bright  colorful the only downside is that i am wearing these due to leg swelling  when my calves are real swollen which is often unfortunately the design on some of these socks gets stretched out making it so you lose the very thing that makes these so pretty the design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost at times  not so colorful this hasnt happened on all the ones ive purchased i have about 6 pairs but definitely on some of them if youre very thin or dont experience much swelling this probably wont be a problem at all a solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes maybe just small  large,human
these socks are amazing the fabric is soft and smooth and they feel great on my skin the bright colorful designs are a fun change from the usual drab compression socks however the design stretches when my calves are swollen which affects their appearance,ai
i like these pacific gloves there nicer then other gloves i have bought beforethe gloves are very comfortable not the heavy thick ones  that i have bought at the grocery store before thathave always been too big clumsy  and uncomfortable and i usually would only use about 3 times and forget about themthese are a size medium fit me but the small would have been better i have long thin fingersthe inside is soft and actually feels goodi use these pacific gloves for doing the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and washing my heavy cast iron pansthese gloves get a good grip on heavy cookwarei also like the sleeves  are long and the water does not run inside and i use them for gardeninggood price for two utility gloves,human

i love this dry brush  ive never heard of dry brushing before but im glad i did  the dry brush is very invigorating  i used it on the backs of my arms and legs and my back in circular motions i wish now i had bought the handle my husband helped me it felt so good and left my skin with a rosy glow  after showering i felt the circulation much improved in all the areas i brushed  first day it just felt good the second time i used it i noticed my skin tightening a bit and the skin on my arms felt softer even my lotion seemed to absorb better  im very satisfied with the construction of the brush also  its well worth what i paid  the strap is secure and it has a groove in the back to attach a handle which im purchasing right away,human
love the dry brush improves circulation and leaves skin feeling soft and tight worth the purchase will buy a handle soon,ai
these are surprisingly thicker than i imagined but still allowed me enough maneuverability to get dishes and household cleaning done my hands are on the smaller side so this is always an ongoing issue for being as sturdy as they are i like that i could still use them these gloves provide a great alternative to anyone with latex issues only used these for a week or so but there are no signs of wear on them as yet,human
thicker than expected but still flexible suitable for cleaning great for people with latex allergies,ai
this flavor is scrumptious very soft and creamy almost feels like a full calorie full sugar dessert but without all the carbs and sugars very satisfying to me just remember to warm them in a micro for just a few seconds thats the big catch so dont plan on using them for on the go unless you leave them someplace warm where they will stay soft,human
delicious flavor creamy and satisfying best when warmed up for a few seconds,ai
great pads and they wash up nice only issue is that since the cleaning agents are in the disposable pads from irobot you get just plain water unless you spray your floors with cleaner i used the wet mop pads to get the sticky dirty stuff and then used a disposable to get the floors clean by running the mop again,human
works well for cleaning but requires an external floor cleaner for sticky residue pads wash nicely,ai
these detergent packs have a really awful odor when you open the container  i didnt want them to be scented and they arent but they have an offputting odor for sure  they do not make the dishes or the air smell bad thankfully  they also work very well and do not leave any residue on the dishes  4 stars for that smellbleh,human

this massager is ok  i can recline in my zerogravity chair and its pretty nice behind my low back holds up to my weight but i can tell its starting to struggle a little as opposed to another brand i have that doesnt give in at all i also wouldnt advertise it as a neck massager  its too wide for the neck scrapes the outline of the traps but thats about it not bad on upper back its a onetrick pony but thats what these little massage pillows are its a 35  pretty good not great and compared to another one ive reviewed slightly underwhelming enough to not give it a 4,human
okay massager good for lower back but not for neck underwhelming compared to another brand,ai
works as intended,human

this is an attractive and giftable set of six bath bombs the amazon site says the four fragrances are lavender vanilla rose and orange but it was hard for me to detect those aromas they all smell nice  but the fragrance difference is super subtle they are made with essential oilsi tried the greenishbluishyellow bomb in my foot bath i used hot to tepid water and suds were created in the foot bath and the bomb fizzed as shown in the video it eventually in about 10 minutes dissolved in the water as i bathed my feet my feet felt clean and i liked the subtle scent my feet also came out feeling  soft unfortunately there was a slight adherence of the green color of the bomb to my ankles and heels but it was ever so slight a white bathtub might develop a slight ring of color around it from these bombs but i suspect it would immediately wash off insofar as performance these bombs are really good luckily i had a strainer in my sink because i had no idea there was a surprise miniature animal figurine in these i had a little dinosaur in mine although no price is listed i suspect these will be priced between 1699 and 1899,human
attractive bath bomb set with subtle scents a fun surprise inside and leaves skin feeling soft though there may be slight color residue,ai

i compared this with elderberry emergenc ec  the ingredients are similar as far as sugar 5g vit d3 125 and 50mg elderberry  this one has 25mg zinc227 compared with 10mg with ec vitamin c is low at 270mg 1000mg ec i like more vit c  this one does have turmeric root extract 140mg which scores with me  salt is the 4th ingredient with 23 of daily sodium 29 chloride  thats a lot for me  i definitely taste ityou absolutely need to mix this in 16ou of water  it doesnt fizz  stir it  mild citrus taste  overall not my cup of sports drink or immunity drink  i think if youre out sweating hard like a lineman in a football game or prefer more nacl than this will work for you  the ingredients and packaging otherwise look good,human
compared to emergenc this has more zinc but less vitamin c suitable for those needing more sodium,ai

i buy a lot of turmeric powder either from amazon or from my nearest multicultural food market  i make what is called golden paste out of turmeric coconut oil water and freshly ground black pepper  it has helped me and my husband immensely with bone and joint health  im 62 and play very competitive tennis singles and doubles against opponents less than half my age and i often win  i am a true believer in the miracle of golden paste as my previously super sore and creaky knees have been transformed into those of a 25 year olds  no kidding  please google golden paste and see how easy it is to make at home and give it a try  when this organic turmeric came up on my list of items i could review it took less than a nano second to select it  i think its wonderful it comes in 3 smaller bags instead of one big one and it seems to be among the best organic turmeric ive used,human

these work great to wipe if you can keep hold of them they slide all around and they dry out pretty fast i think if they were each maybe twice as big it wouldnt be so difficult to use these to remove nail polish i have to stack 2 together to effectively remove the nail polish but they are lint free there no problem there,human
wipes are lintfree but they dry out quickly and are difficult to hold need to use two at once for effective nail polish removal,ai
while packaged attractively and according to the company website  all organic ingredients it is not clear how much evidence there is for the longterm or short term effectiveness of the aromatherapy blends  this particular blend is heavy on ginger but dissipates very quickly  while no doubt the initial whiff provides a positive awakening energy it doesnt linger long enough to be able to notice significant change in mood or any symptoms  unsure if at this price point it provides significant advantage over using ones own blends in diffusers,human
aromatherapy blend is refreshing initially but doesnt last long enough to notice significant effects not sure if it justifies the price,ai

i finally have to admit that im getting older and my feet hurt when i wear boots in particular  after a couple of hours in i have to take them off or sit down because the balls of my feet will burn and its just uncomfortablei have some knee damage and i broke my foot a few years ago so these days even more than before i am aware of how uncomfortable feet affect my mood  my posture and my balancewhen you are not walking straight and even late  it can affect your hip and lower back as well  these insoles are an absolute godsend in my pictures youll see how much thicker they are near the balls of the feet than the ones you get at the store  or even the custom ones i had made at a local store nothing beats these for comfort the gel is thick and distributes evenly in such a way that i feel like im wearing my slippers all day i live in south texas where boots are an absolute staple in the summer or winter and these insoles have made such a differenceyou will have to cut them down to size just like with most insoles that you buy at the store  and since they are thicker than any others i have ever bought i do need to wear thinner socks but since boots western ones in particular tend to be a little roomier  these insoles work perfectly with themi dont know what negative ion technology is but i really dont need to know the details all i need to know is that these will stay in my boots and i will replace them every six months as recommended because ive never been more comfortable in my boots after wearing them the first day my daughter borrowed them from me and put them in her shoes because she was planning on a long day at school and work she too was amazedat 23 years old she has discovered that gel insoles are not just for old ladies like her mom i never thought id be sitting here riding along review about my feet come on my boots or insoles but here i am raving about my latest discovery i can definitely recommend this to anyone,human

i read the reviews and was scared it might break when installing so i called drive medical and a tech walked me through each step not only that but he took the model number and installed one with me while we were on the phone that way he was able to give more detailed instructions when the upper washer seemed to not fit well it got installed in about 5 minutes with no tools and is perfect for me there are more expensive models but this has all the features recommended by my occupational therapist in fact she installed it with me she thought it important for me to have an onoff switch in the handle and the ability to divert water into the regular shower head as needed its the perfect length color and very easy for me to handle plus it came in 24 hours and i didnt pay extra,human
at first i was concerned it might break during installation but a tech from drive medical helped me over the phone and everything went smoothly it was installed in about five minutes no tools required the product works perfectly and has all the features recommended by my occupational therapist it even arrived within 24 hours with no extra charge,ai

ive went through about 4 foot spa machines and this by far is the best and i will surely keep it is big enough space for my husband who is a size 11 and he says he still has a lot of room second i love the remote control and drain something ive not really considered and am glad i got this honestly i got this on a whim thinking id just return it if i end up not liking it did not read that it had a remote lol as you see in the video it works so hooray the drain is kinda slow but dont let that stop you if spillage is your concern this drains slowly and no spills third the heater works unlike some that only retain the heat this one really heats up the water for you i know because i put cold tap water and heated it to 40 fourth i loooove the rollers at the bottom this made filling up and then moving it near the couch so easy no carrying for me less mess less spillage fifth the cover and the tools that came with it they are useful bonuses if you are like me who like to keep things dust free the cover is something that you will surely appreciate and of course the tools at first i didnt use them but they helped to get the smaller areas of my husbands feet i dont know how to use all of them but im sure they will all play a role someday lol overall recommend steep price but it isnt your regular foot spa it is worth it i promise,human
ive tried several foot spa machines and this one is by far the best theres enough room for my husband even with his size 11 feet i love the remote control the builtin drain and the heater that warms the water the rollers on the bottom make it easy to move around and the cover and tools are great bonuses although its a bit pricey its definitely worth it,ai
very comfortable to wear they really are as comfortable as a pair of glasses even with a shield attachedunfortunately there is such a gap on each side i would not wear this without a mask underneath these face shields would be useful if you are only expecting something to splatter right between your eyes or in the exact middle of your face nowhere elseso these are fine depending on the level of protection youre looking forthe shields attach with a pulloff tape that sticks to the eyeglass portion,human
these face shields are comfortable but i wouldnt wear them without a mask underneath due to the gap on each side they work fine for basic splatter protection but arent suitable for comprehensive face coverage,ai

i appreciate the backlight on this device it makes it much easier to read and is accurate too,ai
these masks are soft and comfortable to wear but i wear eyeglasses and these masks do nothing to prevent fogging when you are wearing the mask although the fabric is 2 ply your breath freely passes through the fabric and causes instant eyeglass fogging whenever the temperatures are cool since i live in minnesota cold temperatures are a constant issue very disappointed i expected more from this purchase,human
while these masks are soft and comfortable they do not prevent fogging when i wear glasses the fabric allows breath to pass through causing fogging in cooler temperatures which is a major downside,ai

this is a white noise sound machine with a total of 6 sounds it sits up like an alarm clock i love that it is battery operated i charged it overnight this comes with a usb cable not the typical micro usb perhaps type c the unit itself and an instruction pamphlet operation is simple as per my video press and hold the onoff button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off  rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook thunder white noise wave wind and bonfire all but one sound is pure annoying noisethe timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off it means the timer is offthere is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on the nightlight button is in the center top there are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light  the first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial the second press turns on one side of dots then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off the next press keeps all the dots lit this is what they call breathing lightsthe volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volumethe current price of 1619 2699 minus 40 would be extremely reasonable for this if i liked it but i do not it has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights i like the look of this and that it is battery operated i also like the simple operation however the two most important features nightlight and sound are lackluster in my opinion,human
this white noise machine offers six sounds and is batteryoperated its easy to use but the sounds are limited and the nightlight feature isnt as useful as i had hoped while it looks nice im not completely satisfied with the performance,ai

these clippers are sold under various brand names but have one thing in commonthey do the job regular clippers that are of the same design always used to scare me because for what ever reason they were too imprecise and often ended up cutting into the nails quick and frankly made me avoid clipping my nails until they were past due eventually i gave up using clippers and just used the scissors in my swiss army knife which lead to imprecise cuts that needed filing to look acceptable but at least they didnt draw blood  thick solid build that made me realize just how cheaply regular clippers were stamped out the cutting edges are precisely machined and in the 8 years i have owned them there is no perceived dulling of the cutting edges  the product should last a life time  a lot of time i have just held them and admired how precisely they were built and how attractive the results were i own both sizestoenaillarge and fingernailsmall and find the small size hard to to get a firm grip oni would recommend caution about  the small size regardless of your finger size and opt for the large regardless for both toe and fingernails the only thing approaching second rate is the brand name decal stuck in the indentation the clippers themselves should have green bell stamped on back they sold as seki edge but are the same green bell clippers,human
these clippers available under different brand names get the job done theyre wellbuilt with precisely machined cutting edges that stay sharp after years of use i recommend opting for the larger size regardless of your finger size the small size is harder to grip,ai

more than likely if you are using this you are under the care of a doctor  it is a fabulous dressing although admittedly expensive  i wish mine lasted several days but a day is all i see to be able to get out of them before they need to be changedit is good that there is no adhesive border  wounds are typically irregular in shape and the entire area most be covered  if you can not find one large enough you can use two together  if there was an adhesive border it would then stick to the wound which would be harmful  it is much easier to use your own adhesive which you know will not irritate your skin  as my skin is easily irritated it is necessary i use an adhesive for fragile skin and many of the adhesive borders already in place end up damageing my skin,human

i used to love these energy drinks and have used them for years but i do not see myself repurchasing in the future they recently changed the formula and the flavor  i dont mind the flavor change even though it is not as good as it used to be  but the main difference is that these do not work the same for me as the original formula  from what i can tell they halved the amount of 34spike formula34 in the ingredients and changed around the order of the 34other ingredients34  it doesnt really matter since whatever they did it is not as effective now as it used to be which is a shame,human

i completed the full bottle of pills and my conclusion is that this product did nothing i consider myself a biohacker and i am in tune with how my body responds perhaps the effect is masked by all the other supplements and peptides i take i tried to isolate the effect from my other supplements and energy drinks i tried taking more than the recommended dose taking it spread throughout the day taking it in the evening in addition to recommended three pills at onceif this supplement does anything it is too subtle for me to notice some supplements and medications take time to build up before their effect becomes noticeable but i did not notice anything from this at any time during the month i was hoping this would work since the company seems wellintentioned with a belief that what they are selling worksthis is clearly not a stimulant anything that is a stimulant is more immediately effective than this productthe clinical trials are meaningless if they used a placebo as a comparison they should be comparing competing products such as caffeine adderall ritalin and modafinil all of these competing drugs are less expensive than this supplement excluding the cost of the doctors visit to get the prescription the real challenge for supplements like these is how it stacks up against caffeine or a monster energy drink not a sugar pillpeople that are avoiding stimulants are not going to eat cocoons either products like this target the fringe of biohackers who already take numerous other supplements and are not nutrient deficient in anything the target audience is different from a clinical trial groupthe main compound adding to the cost is the peptide for brainenhancing peptides semax and cerebrolysin are established proven and scientifically validated peptides and both work great in me and have noticeable effects i am not sure what cocoon peptide is supposed to do and the web site of the vendor does not mention how it works what is the mechanism of action the other peptides i mentioned increase bdnf levels and are less expensive than this producti am a man in my 40s and i have tried a large number of supplements nootropics medications and peptides to help increase productivity focus and mental performancethe moneybackguarantee helps for a product like this but it seems like you will need to take a test at the start of the 30 days to activate the offer,human
i didnt notice any difference after finishing the bottle despite trying different dosing methods this product didnt seem to have any noticeable effects on me,ai

quite an advantage when sitting for a prolonged period on hard surfaces not really 34soft34 but adds a lot of comfort as your weight seems more distributed and hence the 34nopressure34  it is very portable and works on many surfaces my wife sits on it when on a soft sofa and has significantly less lumbar pain  i have been using 2 different types of the horseshoe shaped chair cushions with the sacral cutouts for about 1 year  and find these to be amazing when sitting for long periods on a wooden chair but they are more rigid and do not quite distribute pressure like the purple to be honest i put the purple pad on the chair then the anatomically shaped butt cushion and together they are the ideal solution most comfortable sitting arrangement i have found ever,human

this toothpaste has an interest flavor never had a lemon mint toothpaste and its not bad it will probably grow on me more too one of the main reasons why i got this toothpaste was because the ingredients seemed better than conventional toothpaste although i didnt realize it contained silica never heard of it before either so i looked put up to see what it was i guess it is ok to use but i also read it could wear down your enamel so i dont think im going to be using this regularly just in case i may use it weekly or even biweekly the toothpaste doesnt foam up much which some people may not like besides the silica concern i like the toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean,human

full disclosure yes im a very tall and heavy guy so this review may not apply to a lot of people  on the other hand im within the advertised rating for weight for this stool and my disability makes it a necessity to get around in my kitcheni had high hopes for this product  the same feature thick seat padding that makes this uncomfortable for me after prolonged use is also what makes it durable for my weightso thats an even trade  after all its a stool and not a recliner  im good with thatwhat im not happy about is that after just over two months of using for about 40 minutes a day a wheel fell off this morning and wouldnt snap back in again  then i was surprised to see that the sockets for the wheels to snap into are just molded plastic  one of the edges of that failed wheel socket had cracked  what a poor designgoing cheap like that instead of a few pennies to put metal inserts into the plasticive poured a bunch of thick super glue into the socket to see if that will work as a temporary fix until a new one can get here  yes im taking a chance on another one of the same type but i cant keep paying about 75 every two months to buy stools that i really need to have to lead a fairly normal life,human

since a relative had a knee replacement weve tried 2 brands of ice bags and 3 brands of cold packs to keep her swelling under control she prefers this ice bag at night because it gets the coldest and conforms to her knee the best get the 11inch bag for knees youll need the extra width once the ice bag is full the 3inch wide opening on this bag enables you to include larger ice chunks instead of having to hammer ice into tiny chunks to get them to fit be sure to dry the threads of the ice cap on the bag and cap before and after use i had leaking from another brand of ice bag after shreds of ice got caught in the threads when i screwed the cap on the leaking stopped with that bag and ive never had leaking with this bag when i kept everything dry,human

listen lets be frank it tastes yucky yes but appears to work i am very bad at being consistent in taking something that i dont really like but maca powder seems to balance the system boost energy and certainly keeps you regular as to the claims of heightened sexual appetite not so sure perhaps one has to take it a while first hint the easiest way for me to take something that reminds me of dirty chalk in my mouth is to mix it with a very hot sweetened vanilla based tea like pumpkin spice vanilla bean or even almond even a regular basic tea sweetened with a tiny splash of vanilla extract is better,human

at the current price of 3324 3499 minus 5 this is super expensive for something that can only be used as a nightlight i was unable to pair this to any bluetooth device and i tried a couple also the touch controls are quirky the timer goes off by itself with any button change the light comes on automatically sometimes and the pausemove ahead button is for show only as it does nothing there are buttons on the front of the unit and on the bottom it is impossible to read the bottom buttons this is nice as a nightlight only and is barely functional as a sound machine with only 5 sounds this is definitely not worth the current price for such a quirky and partially working sound machine,human

i have long been curious about wen but am always leery of getting locked into automatic shipments which is what happens often when ordering from tv or a website i found out that sephora now sells it so off i went to buy some i was convinced that it was the answer for my sunandcurlingirondamaged hair i bought the almond mint one there and tried it a few times quite frankly at the time i was disappointed and returned to my regular shampoo  conditioner admittedly my hair was in pretty bad shape well a few weeks ago i went to the salon and had about 8 inches cut off and i tried wen on it again and had several good hair days i became curious about this orange blossom scent which is not available at sephora so i ordered iti actually buckled down and followed directions this time it has taken some patience but i finally got the knack of how best to use it on my hair my hair is now short in back longer in front with bangs the texture is mediumfine and i have a good bit of hair so it often looks thicker than it really is humid climate plays a part in that first off 1016 pumps of this is far too much and takes forever to rinse out the magic number for me is 57 pumps secondly i use lukewarm not cold water to wash and cooler water to rinse and i do rinse well after leaving it on for the duration of my shower  this is very important as it will leave a film on my hair if i dont thirdly i massage it very well into my scalp adding a bit more water and then comb through to the endsboth the almond mint and the orange blossom work equally well so i know this orange blossom wen is the real thing my hair looks and feels better than it has in a long time it has bounce shine and holds a style beautifully i now only use a tiny bit of mousse on my bangs and spray lightly with hairspray and do not need to comb or brush for the rest of the day even in high humidity i do work outside and so the style does fall some by the end of the day but that is to be expected with an active job like mine but the damage and dryness that had been plaguing me have all but disappeared since i have been using wen when i feel it creeping back i just use the remoist mask by wen and that fixes it straight awaya note on the scent it really does not smell like orange blossoms to me but it is pleasant with a fresh floral aroma and maybe just a hint of spice i can still smell it faintly in my hair after blow drying whereas with the almond mint i cannoti am really happy with this product and do not intend to ever use anything else on my hair again,human
i was hesitant to try wen due to concerns about automatic shipments but i eventually purchased it at sephora initially i wasnt impressed but after a significant haircut i gave it another shot i found that 57 pumps worked best for my mediumfine hair the product has restored my hairs health adding shine bounce and smoothness the scent of the orange blossom version is pleasant though not exactly like the flower im now a dedicated user of wen and wont use anything else,ai

i ended up not not being able to take this  myoinositol is great for hashimotos  i have elevated tpo antibodies and elevated tsh  but i missed the addition of dchiro which is great for pcos  but the dchiro portion lowers cortisol and my cortisol is actually already on the low side  one needs well functioning adrenals to help with the hashimotos so it is a catch 22as a side note  cordyceps is supposed to lower tpo antibodies by 45 if that is something you needso while these capsules are easy to take and did not upset my gut i could not continue taking them,human

i have been buying these little guys for quite some time i love them because they are unscented and they are not huge this time when i bought them the packages are different they do not have the same plastic lid and the biggest difference is the wipes are not layered within one another so that when you pull one out the next when its ready there is no way little hands or fingers of little children are going to be able to figure out how to get the wipes out i end up pulling out wads of them i am not sure why this changed and i do not like it and i will not buy these again until i can be assured that they are layered so they come out of the container easy,human

i dont know why i never thought about getting a pill box in the past especially since i usually grab an empty medicine bottle to carry benadryl aspirin etc when i go out of town and i always say to myself i dont want to mix my pills but i also dont want to carry multiple prescription bottles so when i was offered these for an honest review i said to myself this really makes so much sense and guess what it does lizimandu has created some beautiful pill boxes inspired by van gogh these are perfect for people who travel or who have to take medicine on a regular basis each pill box is divided into 3 compartments they are small enough to fit inside your purse travelmakeup bag or bookbag they arent that expensive and would be perfect to give as gifts the only reason i am deducting a half of star is because i believe having a removable option for the compartment would allow people to put larger pills inside perhaps having the ability to twist the compartment and remove it would have made this 5 stars,human
i never thought of using a pill box before but it makes so much sense now lizimandus pill boxes inspired by van gogh are great for traveling or daily use they fit perfectly in purses or small bags the only downside is the compartments are a bit small for larger pills but a removable option would fix this overall a welldesigned product thats also a great gift idea,ai

it may be a particular brand of tennis shoe but when i walk for long periods of time in them my toes start to hurt usually it is my second toe and it hurt like it was sprained  anyway i am overweight and attributed a lot of the problem to my weight but noticed with other sneakersflip flops etc with the same distance when walking the pain didnt happen  the tennis shoes were expensive and it was too late to return them so instead of losing out on being able to wear them entirely i thought to try these  they worked and they worked well  i dont experience that same pain in my toes or when it does it is after walking over two miles and not on the first mile  a fairly inexpensive fix to the problem but next time i go to purchase new walking shoes i will try a different brand,human

chocolatey but not chocolate milk i despise chocolate milk flavor reminds me of the inside of a 3musketeers candy bar liquify that keep it thick and that is what it makes me think of it is really thick could easily water it down or use milk of choice or add to blender with some ice and get something that tastes much like a milk shake or frosty reminds me of a frosty when i do thatnot a low calorie food but is within the norm for drinks and powders of this ilk i love meal replacement drinks over plain protein as the added vitamins minerals and fiber make me feel better than protein alone  i make smoothies and use prefab nutrition drinks like this as a means to get something in my body when i dont feel like eating i often dont have an appetite until half way through my day but i will feel some low level hunger and i know i need something to power me through my physical work day so a simple smoothie usually works and allows me to add in other supplements such as collagen mushroom powder that being said at some point i am never quite satisfied with a liquid meal but still dont want a meal so i usually add in a few nibbles of something whether it be fruit veg cheese stick snack bar etcworks great as a snack or even as a dessertsweetened primarily with allulose and finishes with some sucralose splenda i dont really have an opinion on either sweetener i find both are very sweet without an aftertaste and i dont have digestive issues from itpack of six 32 ounce bottles which contain 4 8 ounce servings all told same as a pack of 24 bottles at 8 ounces each i like the option of it having a few servings worth in one big bottle as it cuts down on packaging but it also reduces my ability to just grab and go however they do carry these in other sizesprice per ounce is very similar to others with blood glucose support in mindi have to say i didnt know what to expect with my first sip i was impressed with taste texture and how there was no odd taste or funny after taste really quite pleasing flavor the extra thick texture makes it versatile thick makes it feel like a shake and triggers belly into thinking there is something in there but it also allows for it to be watered down some if you want something to sipim impressed and would recommend this of course take a look at ingredients and decide if it is good for your needs,human
the flavor is chocolatey but not like chocolate milk which i dislike it reminds me of the inside of a 3 musketeers bar  thick chocolatey and satisfying its filling and can be thinned with water or milk or blended with ice for a milkshakelike treat its not lowcalorie but offers a balanced nutritional profile including vitamins minerals and fiber its a great choice for a meal replacement especially on days when i dont feel like eating sweetened with allulose and sucralose its very sweet without an aftertaste its a versatile drink thats easy to add to smoothies im impressed and would definitely recommend it,ai
my kids are super picky its like they know they are eating something for their health and immediately is bad but these are great they love eating them the flavor is not strong but enough to be tasteful for them they have a great consistency and are chewablesthey are sugar free and thats really a plusin times when health is so important this probiotics are the bestlike them,human

this is a smart little case  it has sections and a divider to allow for separation of items which is helpful to prevent necklace chains earrings etc from getting all jumbled together  however because it does have dividers it has a bit of thickness to it  while this is a good wellmade case ill bet someone will create a jewelry organizer soon that will keep items separate without adding the extra fabric that is in this one  i also wish it came in other colors  when it comes to jewelry while traveling my preference is to have a bright color that cannot be overlooked on a dresser top or inside a hotel safe when packing to leave  how bout a bright neon greenif you find this review helpful please let me know by using the voting buttons  through the years i have relied on reviews to make smart purchases and now im trying to 34pay it forward34 by helping others with my reviews  please let me know how im doing with your vote  thanks,human
this case is a clever design it includes dividers to keep items separated which prevents jewelry like chains and earrings from tangling however the thickness from the dividers is noticeable its wellmade but i think someone will soon create a more compact organizer that still keeps items separate i also wish it came in more vibrant colorssomething like neon green would make it easier to spot in a hotel safe or on a dresser i rely on reviews for smart purchases and aim to help others with my feedback if this was helpful let me know by voting thanks,ai

this thing is a godsend i was spending 100 on acupressure spa visits to lessen the pain in my neck using this the first time brought tears to me eyes because it was so damn good i was able to target the abd spot right where i needed it the most plus the heat helps wish it was more heat i also wish the handles were loops because its a tad awkward to readjust from neck to upper or lower back as you have to remove from from inside the cuffs minor thing really but being able to hang arms inside the cuffs means you get to control how mnuch pressure is applied which is the key to delviering the massage i was impressed at how well made this thing is very good stitiching and love the red glow you get from the item for the price i paid its amazing value and really does work it has helped to reduce my neck pains i use it before going to bed and wake up with much lesser pains in my neck i only wish i had bought this item sooner i wish the nodes could be spaced further apart its fixed position this thing is really meant to be used mostly on the neck but since you can move it around you can target those sore spots any where also works wonders on the lower calf not so great on lower back for me nodes too close but again simply move it around to target the spot i also wish the power cord were longer you almost need a extension cord if you want to use it where ever so keep that in mind youll need a power outlet where ever you plan to sit for the next hour,human
this product is a lifesaver i used to spend 100 on acupressure spa visits for neck pain relief after using this for the first time i was nearly brought to tears because it felt so effective it targets sore spots precisely and the heat feature adds extra comfort my only minor suggestion would be for the handles to be loops for easier adjustment between neck and back areas the construction is excellent with solid stitching and a pleasant red glow for the price its an incredible value and has significantly reduced my neck pain i use it before bed and my neck feels much better in the morning i just wish i had purchased this sooner,ai
this is a rather large product but i like the shape and how it can stand up on its own on the carpet it has lights on it that fluctuate to different colors but if you are using it when you are sleeping the lights can be turned off it has several different levels of use and you can turn it on high to get the most heavy air cleaning seems to work well and its easy to remove and clean the filter,human

we purchased this for our babys room we already had one for our own bedroom and loved it totally drowns out the sounds of life outside the window and allows for a deeper sleepour baby now associates the noise machine with sleeping and her eyelids start drooping the moment we turn it onfour stars because it does seem that the noise gets softermuffled after a few months of use i thought maybe this was just me going deaf but i dont think so the new one we got for the baby is definitely louder than our old workhorse i also think the holes in the machine that are supposed to allow you to vary the volume of sound dont really do enough there is a noticeable difference in volume but not enough rangeupdated review february 2017 one of our machines has developed a truly irritating rattle it took a couple days of terrible sleep before i figured it out like another reviewer mentioned it seems better if the machine is on an angle but the rattle is so unpredictable im ordering a replacement and hoping this is just the result of years of nightly use and not some sort of manufacturing quality issue our device and the newer one we got for our daughter are identical and weve moved them around enough that we dont know which was the original anymore,human
this noise machine is a game changer we loved it for our bedroom so we got another for our babys room and its amazing for drowning out outside sounds the baby now associates it with sleep which makes bedtime easier however after months of use the sound does seem softer and one machine developed an annoying rattle hoping a replacement will fix the issue as its been a nightly staple for years,ai
this stuff works wonders,human

although i havent used coppertone for years this certainly is the smell that i remember from way back when those days before an spf was listed on the bottle the days when there were billboards with the little girl with the tan line as the dog tugged on her bathing suit bottomfor nostalgia alone i would like this product the fact that it feels much better going on than i remember the old ones to be is a big plusit has an spf of 30 and since i usually use it around a pool the fact that its water resistant is also very nicejust remember to put it on as the label suggests applying at 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying after swimming or at least every 2 hours,human
coppertone brings back such nostalgia for meits the same classic smell i remember from childhood but now with spf  it goes on smoother than i recall and is waterresistant perfect for pool days just follow the directions to reapply as needed and itll keep you covered,ai

my boyfriend swears by tart cherries in any form  ive read a lot about them and sour cherry reduces inflammation and muscle soreness helps with insomnia and prevents gout a form of arthritis  inflammation is my middle name so i wanted to try this although i dont have gout i do have arthritis in various parts of my body i also have daily muscle aches and inflammation which was recently verified by a doctor yet after consuming these capsules for a couple of weeks they have had no effect either good or bad on me i should be finished with the bottle in another two weeks  the positive is that i did not have any side effects  ive used natures bounty red yeast rice and although that product worked for me to lower my cholesterol i had a permanent nasty side effect from it therefore i consider the absence of any bad effects with this supplement a big plus on the other hand ive had no reduction in soreness or inflammation so its like taking a placebo for me  it does appear this tart cherry concentrate works for some so i suggest anyone considering this give it a trydepending on how many pills are taken per day this bottle provides a 60 30 or 20 day supply the recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills per day with meals the max ive taken was 2 per dayi called natures bounty to understand why the bottle says 1000mg equivalent on the front yet the back says 250mg per capsule what the fellow say to me was that the powder is concentrated and the 250 is the weight if you were to empty the contents of the capsule however he said since it is an extract these compressed components are equivalent to 1000mg per capsule whether this is really true or not i have no ideaas for the ingredients besides the tart cherry prunus cerasus fruit extract each capsule also includes vegetable cellulose and less than 2 of silica and vegetable magnesium stearate this is suitable for vegetarians,human
tart cherry capsules sounded promising as ive read they help with inflammation muscle soreness insomnia and even gout while i didnt notice any major improvements in my symptoms after a couple of weeks i didnt experience side effects either the pills are vegetarian and include a concentrated extract which the brand claims is equivalent to 1000mg it might work for others but for me it felt like taking a placebo,ai

these provide some support for my bad knee but ultimately they dont have any side support to stabilize my knee these are probably better for light walking and some gentle exercise though they have compression support it doesnt prevent side twisting motion which is how i can hurt my knee i dont really think there is anything special to copper infused compression sleeves it kind of reminds me of the magnetic bracelets they sell that boast claims but have no real science behind iti received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review i am under no obligation to provide a positive review and received no incentives or rewards for doing so my goal is to highlight features and drawbacks that i would want to know about as a buyer not hype the product for the manufacturer to increase sales my remarks are sincere and true i work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item my goal is ensure that these reviews are helpful to others my opinions are my own and i thoroughly believe in keeping the integrity of amazon reviews legitimate to help the community make the best choices it is just my own opinion and experience with the product your own opinion and experience may vary i received no monetary compensation and i am not required to give a good review just looking at my public profile and you will see i dont hand out many 5 star reviews they need to be earned for me to recommend a product regardless of the price i paidkindly click yes below if you found my review helpful,human

problem with this belt is you warm up the packet and it can get lava hot but you cannot feel it through the too thick super synthetic material of the pouch so once the super hot gel pack is inserted into the pouch you barely feel it i was looking for one with cotton pouch and clay beads but they were too  had bad ratings this would be great if the pouch was different to transfer the heat from the gel pouch plus after a few times in the microwave the gel seems to be burning through the lining of the gel pack so it might not have great longevity as well,human

these are excellent towels for certain cleaning tasks they are thin but absorb quickly and hold a decent amount of water they can be rinsed laid flat to dry and reused several times making them go a lot further than a roll of conventional paper towelsthey are ideal for certain cleaning tasks especially windows glass smooth tile and other types of smooth surfaces they are not however all that good for scrubbing or use over a rough surface they can be used for that but the roughness will shred the towel making it only good for one use if used on smooth surfaces they can be rinsed and reused multiple timesfor me these are ideal for washing windows i use a few sheets of these towels with cleaning liquid to get the dirt off the window then use a single microfiber cloth for a final dry and polish the used towels are rinsed and set aside to dry for the next task i can usually get 4 or 5 uses out of a single towel before it starts to shred upmy only quibble is that i dont care for the graphics printed on the towels they arent bad looking just unnecessary other than that no complaints they work well last a good amount of time eliminate the waste of using onetime use paper towels and are a good value compared to other similar towels as well compared with  conventional paper towels since one of these towels can take the place of many onetime use paper towels,human
these towels are fantastic for specific cleaning tasks they are thin but absorb water quickly and hold a good amount you can rinse them let them dry flat and reuse them multiple times making them a more sustainable option than paper towels theyre perfect for cleaning windows glass and smooth tiles however they arent as effective for rough surfaces as they might tear the only downside is the unnecessary graphics printed on them aside from that they perform excellently last a long time and are more costeffective than paper towels,ai

i havent been using this long so far just once a day im a little confused on dosing there isnt any information regarding it on packaging other than add 1 scoop to your juice smoothy or whatever it says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract powder is that just weight or is that the actual amount because that is 3000 mg of this extract otherwise which is higher than some other similar products out there maybe the serving size just happens to be larger where as the others are smaller with expectation to use it 23 times a day this lack of clear info is frustrating hopefully other reviewers can comment on thatas for how it works well i am not exactly sure what i am looking for it to do and how to measure my experience i know it has been an ingredient used in weight loss formulations and i sure could stand to lose several pounds but im not sure about that for reviewing easily reading through some potential benefits like better digestion better concentration reduced food cravings loss of appetite reduced joint pain improved cholesterol levels  better mood etc i figure the one i can measure best is the food cravings i know what my habits are and i will know if my desire for sugary foods reduces so if i notice a reduction then i can attribute it to this so far not feeling that but it is early on and i have taken but one serving a day i will give it a little more time and report back your desires for taking this as a supplement may vary from my own there is no shortage of info on what this fruit is or its purported benefits are as well as risks such as do not take if have dementia or alzheimers  so please read up i know i am still learningactual product so i will tell you more about the product itself it is an 8 ounce bag of  garcinia cambogia extract powder it is a resealable mylar bag with a front window so you can see how much is in there it comes with a small scoop which is one serving in my pic it shows the little scoop and the amount dumped into my hand there are 76 servings in a container if you plan to use it in liquid plan to use a shaker cup or your blender just stirring it in will not work i included a pic and you can see all the powder just sitting on top strangely my spoon stayed dry so that is when i got out the shaker cup and all blended fine with thatthe taste is absent to me not sure if it supposed to have a noticeable flavor or not the fruit is tart and i hadnt noticed a tart flavor with this maybe my taste buds are off seems that it will go well with yogurt oatmeal blended into smoothies added to soups broths baked goods i have been just consuming it with plain water or some organic lemonade in a shaker cup because like i said it doesnt mix by just stirring the powder is fine and not at all gritty ill likely add it into my next smoothy i havent tried it blended in with coffee next time i will do that i imagine if you like to fill your own capsules that this powder could work for that but i dont know for sureeverything about it seems fresh and of quality i received it in 92019 and it has an expiration date of 32020 6 months from now  if i figure out anything else i will be back to update 3 stars because i need more time with product also i have no idea what the price is and lack of info is concerning,human
ive only been using this product once a day so far so im not sure about the dosage it says each scoop contains  grams of garcinia cambogia extract but im not sure if thats the actual amount or just the weight its frustrating that the packaging doesnt have clear dosing instructions as for the results i havent noticed a reduction in cravings yet but ill give it more time the powder mixes well in a shaker cup and seems to work well with smoothies or juices the taste is mild and im hopeful itll help with my health goals ill update after using it longer,ai

this has a 5 concentration of potassium nitrate which is the ingredient used in all sensitive toothpastes to cut down or in my case eliminate sensitive teeth issues as such it works the same as other sensitive toothpastesit does differ from others with regard to taste and consistency it has a mild minty taste that while acceptable is not all that fresh tasting the consistency is a bit softer than other toothpastes and it doesnt foam up as much while thats usually a plus good foaming action is a benefit when it comes to sensitive toothpastes since it helps the potassium nitrate get into all the nooks and crannies my favorite sensitive toothpaste is the colgate foaming action one it has the same 5 potassium nitrate as this but the foaming action does make a differencewhile the tube looks big theres not a lot of product its only filled about 12 of the way and while it looks like a standard size tube it only provides 35 oz of toothpaste its also hard to get all of it out of the tube since the tube is plastic and does not roll up it dispenses fine when mostly full but is not great at dispensing when the level gets lowwhile this does work the negatives put my score at 3 stars average not a compelling purchase compared with other options,human
this toothpaste contains  potassium nitrate which is the same ingredient used in most sensitive toothpastes to reduce tooth sensitivity it works just like others but it has a milder mint flavor and a softer consistency with less foam the lack of foaming might affect how well the potassium nitrate reaches all areas but it still works the tube looks large but only contains  oz which is only about half full its also hard to get the last bit out since the tube is plastic and doesnt roll while it does work the drawbacks make it a star product for me,ai

im impressed with how effective these liners are for their intended use they have a silky waterproof material on one side and a soft fleecy fabric on the other theyre perfect for low flow days which is where i feel most comfortable using them for light coverage or as a daily liner theyve worked well,ai
overall i am impressed with the effectiveness of these s they are intended silky waterproof like material on one side and soft fleecy material on the other they are meant for low flow which i am really only most comfortable with using it for very light days so please keep that in mind i always wear a liner for various reasons i am using these for that purpose they do not leak there is no odor that i have notices and the material is so soft and comfortable my lady bits like the fleecy feel when done i toss it in the wash or hand wash depending on what i feel likewhile the liners stayed put in a manner that kept me covered  do notice some shifting i am larger in size so underwear is larger and it seems that these were quite loose i think a second button snap right along the first to make more narrow andor a second set to also help keep it in place right now it is one snap loose fit it may not be limited to these this may be the norm this is my first experience with reusable cloths i really like the idea and while i am not ready to fully swap out i can comfortable using these in place of my daily liner or paired with a resuable menstrual cup but for flow i am not there yet in terms of confidence,human
overall this mop and bucket set is pretty solid the mop itself is fantastic the metal pole screws together really securely and the threaded sections are recessed which makes for a sturdy longlasting connection that wont loosen during use the mop head attaches using a snapbutton which is a good quality mechanism my only gripe is the point where the pole meets the mop headits made of plastic while its thick and durable i feel like a metal connection would have been sturdier since thats a potential weak spot the mop head covers are wellmade and attach firmly with velcro and you get two pads in the set theyre machine washable but i recommend hand washing them and letting them air dry flat to preserve their lifespan the bucket design is where things could improve its smaller than similar models which is a plus because its lighter when filled with water however it lacks some useful features like a drain hole at the bottom and its difficult to remove the top for cleaning the handle feels a little flimsy compared to other buckets ive used despite the bucket being a bit of a letdown this is still a great mop set its super easy to get the mop head into the bucket thanks to its springloaded feature that allows it to fold vertically the squeegee works well to wring out the water and having separate wet and dry sides to the bucket speeds up the process and ensures a better clean its not perfect but it offers good value for the price,ai
overall this is a pretty decent mop and bucket set  the mop is excellent the pole is metal and the sections thread together well the threaded portion is recessed into each section making for a very durable solid connection that wont come apart or loosen when using the mop the mop head is not threaded but it has a good quality snap button attachment  the only moprelated complaint i have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic its a decent quality thick plastic but metal would have been nice since thats a strain point on the mopthe mop head covers are of good quality and attach well with velcro to the mop head two pads are provided in the set while they can be machine washed its better to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat it reduces the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machinethe bucket design could have been better it is smaller than another similar product that i have which is actually a positive since it weighs less when full of water however it lacks some key convenience features such as a popopen drain at the base it is also not possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use the overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat lightweight especially the handle it lacks the heft and durability of other similar productswhile the bucket issues brings my score to 4 stars this is still a very good performing set its easy to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a spring that allows it to automatically fold vertically so it can be inserted into the bucket the squeegee on the dry side does a good job of wringing out the water the ability to have a wet and a dry side to the bucket makes mopping quicker easier and results in a better jobnot perfect but a decent value for the price,human

the motif twist is a small portable breast pump thats lightweight and includes a onepiece flange with a comfort cushion it can be batteryoperated which is handy for onthego use while the pump itself is cute it doesnt come with accessories so youll need to buy a tote and cooler separately the pump is quiet and works well but the suction can be a bit loud its a closed pump meaning milk doesnt get into the tubing which is great for hygiene the parts are interchangeable with the motif curve and the comfort cushion makes pumping more comfortable than other models however getting replacement parts can be difficult and the pump is a bit limited in flange size options despite these issues its a solid portable pump that id recommend for anyone who can work with the available parts,ai
motif medical motif twistthe twist is a small lightweight very portable breast pump it comes with a 24mm one piece breast flange with a comfort cushion it can be battery operated with four aa batteries it is rather cute in appearance to me and it comes with a one year warranty replacement parts can be hard to get if one is attempting to order direct however aeroflowbreastpumpscom carries motif medical replacement parts the pump comes with no accessories if you need a tote and cooler youll have to purchase your own warranty on the pump is one year from date of purchase or received through insurancewhats included 4 valves and membranes 2 wide neck bottles ml volume only with nipples and hard plastic sealing disc 2 one piece flanges with comfort cushions  caps flanges included is the standard 24mm only 1 ac power adapter 2 sets of tubingpros twist is a closed pump meaning there is a barrier usually a diaphragm that prevents milk and condensation from entering the tubing small and lightweight which makes for high portability its far lighter than my avent double electric comfort pump and that too is far lighter than other double electric pumps parts is interchangeable with the motif curve flanges is rather light in comparison to other full one piece bodies comfort cushion makes for one of the most comfortable pumping experiences twist has two phase expression when the pump is turned on it starts in the letdown phase where it replicates the faster suckling a baby would do to get milk flowing turning the dial up enters the expression phase when expressing i noted that higher suction has a longer pull on the nipple with some hacks flangesflange bodies can be used from other closed pumps other bottles than can be pumped into is avent classicnatural and dr browns wide neck bottle this is only if using motif flanges twist is a double electric pump allowing mom to express from both breast at the same timecons pump is loud its comparable to avent double electric comfort pump in terms of loudness motif only carries a 24mm flange and a 28mm flange parts is hard to get at this time what i noted is only aeroflowbreastpumpscom carrying all of motif replacement parts one must use motif brand valves and membranes or duckbill valves the flange opening where the valve would go is far smaller than medela so trying to use medela valvemembranes or third party ones from nene supplymayomom will not work with the motif twist flanges tubing is double ended which forces a lactating mom to use motif parts  i did a hack and cut one of the ends off allowing for me to use flangeflange bodies from other companies i also noted that the tubing is rather soft and has some stretch to it allowing for me to remove the excess plastic from the end for use with spectra tubing thus far i was able to use my avent comfort flanges and my medela personal fit connectors with pumpinpals flanges with the motif twist 60 most commercial single user breast pumps use vacuum technology so flanges can be used interchangeably between brands62  this is a personal con which may not be across the board for all moms vaccum sucks the nipple and areola in well and creates good suction i noted this phenomenon between three different company flanges where removing the flange from the breast is a bit of a task and has sort of a pop like noise from the release i dont have this feeling when using electric breast pumps from other companies motif medical only has monday through friday customer service from 8am5pm estupdate 172018i called motifs customer service asking about replacement parts and a larger flange size please understand that cutting the tubing to use different company flanges can and will void out your warranty parts is covered for 3m and motor is one year according to the warranty i was informed that a 32mm flange is in the works and should be available soon this year i was sent two 28mm flanges and extra valvemembranes although i have been using size 30mm flanges for most of my pumping career i recently changed out to size 28mm to note that i am able to express well with the size 30mm may be more comfortable for me to use with no chances of my nipple hitting the back of the flangesmotif has an interesting flange for size 28mm the body and flange is separate from each other the diaphragms i noted is bigger than what is included with the 24mm flange its a small pot and is far deeper than the 24mm ones 24mm flange has a shallow pot diaphragm  the flange is also shaped like a pot it covers all of my areola and is quite comfortable its far more comfortable than medela in my opinion i also decided to change valves from the two piece valvemembrane thing most companies put out i switched to a third party duckbill valve from nenesupply also sold on amazon and noted that it fits onto the flanges and work well the valvemembrane combination doesnt offer good suction thus i need a higher vacuum to express with maymom another third party after market retailer also sold on amazon carries a thread changer which also works well with motif flanges with the thread changer i was able to express into medela and ameda narrow neck bottles just fine the thread changer only works properly with duckbill valves that arent avent  avent style valves one cannot express with using the thread  thread also works well with the two piece valvemembrane combinationoverall i would recommend the twist its a high quality pump and i personally respond to it well flanges are quite comfortable to use and the pump is extremely light weight the pump is rather loud but its no louder than other pumps close to its size replacement parts may be hard to obtain but aeroflow carries them as well as a call to customer service one can get them third party duckbill valves work with motif flanges and the 28mm flanges is easy to cleanupdate 372018i recently went looking for replacement parts only to note that 1 motif updated their website to include a parts store 2 the 28mm flange was updated 32 is still not available neither is a full flange size 21mm or 19mm currently the insert for the 24mm flange reduces the flange down to a 21mm there is an insert for the 28mm flange however i was informed via customer service that its only for added comfort and it doesnt change the flange sizethe 28mm flange is now a single one piece body with a shallow pot diaphragm it was changed as i was told the old version was more expensive to produce than the current model the new 28mm flange has a very similar appearance to the 24mm flange included with the pump i have yet to receive and use the new model but i shall soon and update this review againupdate 3272018i recently called motif customer service as my pump is still under warranty for parts i inquired about the 28mm flanges i was sent another set of flanges though with shipping one of my flanges arrived broken  its no big deal as the original set i was sent is still functioning just fine motif has not changed their 28mm flanges its still a two piece item with a larger pot diaphragm  the parts store shows a replacement diaphragm being the same size as it is for the 24mm flange from what i am seeing via photos and what originally came with my pump the 24mm flange body has a  shallower pot for the diaphragm parts store claims the flanges both 24mm and 28mm use the same size diaphragm but such is not the case as one is far bigger than the other there is still no other flange size out side of 24mm and 28mm 28mm flange now has an insert i have not used nor ordered as the flange is very comfortable to usestill i would recommend the pump for mamas who use the available flange sizes its still a high quality pump and i believe it performs far better than my spectra s2 and my medela pisa  pump in style advance customer service is good and motif makes quality breast pumpsupdate 09122018i recently noted that motif medical has taken to offering their replacement parts and flanges on amazon we can not order breast flange kits with valvesmembranes and tubing included breast flange inserts replacement valvesmembranes diaphragms extra flanges and so on is now sold on here making it convenient to get partsmy pump now being 8m old is currently in the process of being replaced after doing routine maintenance of replacing tubing duckbills  i dont respond well to the valvemembrane combo so i dont use them  and diaphragms monthly i noted that my pump is no longer able to provide me with adequate suction even when increasing the suction on the pump with daily use of three plus times a day it is past its prime as with other pumps ive replaced in the past the old motor will be sent back in exchange for  the new motor i never used the pump as a double as for me i noted that it doesnt perform well as such i always used my pump as a single and on ac power never battery using any pump as a double kills the vacuum strength thus motor is worked harder and mom would need to use higher suction overall i would still recommend this pump for moms on the go now that parts is easier to get and the fact the pump is reasonably priced even when its on sale,human

over the years ive tried several different supplements including a few free samples from bulk supplements i recently decided to add horsetail to my regimen after hearing about its benefits for healthy teeth and gums i wasnt impressed with bulk supplements versionit just didnt feel fresh after two weeks i couldnt really notice any difference so i decided to try a different brand and the difference was night and day the new one smells fresh and earthy and im already seeing better results bulk supplements version just doesnt cut it for me,ai
i have purchased quite a few different supplements and had some free sample sizes from bulk supplements over the last few years horsetail is a herb i have heard about but never thought seriously adding it to my regimen until recently listening to a video on alternative dentistry horsetail is the goto herb for healthy teeth and gums i ordered the herb from bulk supplements and began to take 1teaspoon a day the color of the powder is brown and the taste tolerable i was concerned about the quality and freshness though after taking it for 2 weeks i couldnt tell one way or the other if it was having any effect at all in the meantime i decided to order the same herb through another well known company that only sells fresh dried herbs oils etc organically grow and american made it arrived today this new one is like night and day it is green and smells earthyfresh it is still just tolerable to taste but that is pretty typical with herbs i chuck it back with just enough water to get it down then chase with at least a cup of purified water so sorry bs but your product just doesnt pass the quality test with this particular herb i wouldnt recommend it and i plan on purchasing other herbs from the other company because i know it is high quality,human

update  01062021had to get my hands on the new flavors tried the sample pack and loved them great tasting with the same buzzoriginal reviewim no stranger to caffeine as someone who has always taken preworkouts and drank energy drinks i have a pretty high tolerance to the stuff im always on the lookout to try new products and came across this sample pack of neus three flavors and figured id give it a whirlthe three shots arrived quickly to my door and i waited for the right moment to try the first one all the flavors were good but i personally liked the original tropical punch the best green i took the first shot before a night out and it worked great the stuff is smooth and i felt a lift in my mood about 15 mins after taking it its nice because the 2oz shot doesnt leave you full of liquid just crazy good energy i felt great all night and had zero crash which was exactly what i was looking fori find that the 300mg of caffeine is the sweet spot for me its enough to get me going and not too much where i feel too jittery this product hits that sweet spot perfectly it also has other ingredients like b12 and choline for an additional brain boost overall the formula is strong the product looks amazing and the flavors are greati would highly recommend trying these out for your next night out on the town study session or in the office as a pick me up,human

i dont like the coconut milk in my coffee or tea but i use this whenever light coconut milk is mentioned in a recipe this is a good alterative to buying cans of coconut milk which i use up easily  this 8 oz resealable packet will last me a long time while the canned milk is undeniably thicker and creamier adding warm water to this powdered version still yields enough rich coconut flavor to be satisfactory for my thai dishes i add a spoonful of red or green curry to a frying pan add in the prepared light coconut milk add some ginger lemongrass etc and i have a delicious curry sauce its also nongmo and vegan which is great i wish id known about this product earlier i would have stopped having to buy cans all the time,human

these vitamin c gummies taste amazinglight and citrusy the sugar coating keeps them from sticking and the dosage is just right a bit pricey but worth it for the quality,ai
im pleased with these vitamin c gummies they have a light citrus taste thats very pleasant the consistency is perfect  soft enough to easily chew but not something that sticks to my teeth the gummies are covered with granular sugar which keeps them from sticking to one another even in humid weatherthe vitamin c content is decent with each serving of 2 gummies providing 240mg thats not as high as other gummies but for me its a good dosage level the echinacea content is pretty low at 35mg per serving still i use these for the vitamin c so the echinacea is more like a bonus than something i find essential to have the price is a little high but not out of range for a 60 count bottleoverall score of 45 stars ill round up to 5 since im so pleased with the taste and consistency,human

seriously i love this thing  i hate washing and fixing my hair because it takes forever as i have very thick wavy hair that holds moisture  it takes me at least an hour to blow dry usually still damp at the back of my scalp and straighten my hair  ive taken to using dry shampoo for 3 and 4 days to avoid washing and doing the process all over again  well this brush solves all my problems  the day after i got it i took a shower at night letting my hair air dry a little bit before bed  when i woke the next morning it was pretty gnarly looking think janis joplin i sprayed it with my heat protectant and hit it with the blowdryer for roughly 5 minutes just to make sure it was completely dry that underneath layer was still damp  i cranked the brush up to 450f while i was blow drying and she was ready by the time i was done  i brushed my hair thoroughly to make sure there were no knots to snag  then the miraculous occurred i think i heard a heavenly choir singing  i slowly brushed the first section of my hair  there was no strange pulling no scalding piece of hair to hold no weird kinks against my scalp but it was straight  oh wonder of wonders miracle of miracles  i did one side and then decided i needed to document this process  i went and got dressed must wear a bra for the public good and grabbed my phone to take a few pictures  i started with the brush at 708 and with wardrobe changes and selfies i ended at 722  say what  this brush is my new best friend  i didnt get any finger burns from lava hot hair i even picked out a few stray hairs from the brush while it was on and it didnt burn me what is this sorcery  this brush is amazing and i kind of want to kiss it  if i never buy another hair appliance again i will be totally ok with that  i love this thing almost as much as i love my first kindle,human
i have two germguardian sanitizers one in each of my kids rooms they help reduce odors like baby diapers and seem to contribute to us rarely getting sick they also act as a subtle night light ive been using mine for over a year with minimal maintenance and its still working great if the price drops again ill buy one for my own room too,ai
i have a 6mo old and a 3yr old and have one of these germguardian sanitizers in each of their rooms we hardly every get sick i would like to think these sanitizers play a part in that they make just enough noise to act as a noisemaker as well as put off just enough light to act as a night light very dim one they seem to do a decent deal for removing odor baby diapers from their roomsi have had one of these sanitizers in my older kids room for about a year and half and it is still working great had to replace the bulb once i got a really good deal on the ones i bought on amazon most of the time they are overpriced so wait and you can get a decent deal on these sanitizers if the price drops again i will get one for my room,human

this air purifier is incredible its been great for tackling odors in small rooms including one with dirty laundry ive used similar units but this ones been reliable and effective im planning to buy another one soon,ai

like most stain removers this one works best on fresh stains it worked okay on a recent stain but didnt do anything for an old grease stain the small bottle is handy for travel though and its good for mild recent stains when you dont have other options,ai
like most stain removers this one works best on fresh stains  for example if you just spilled wine on your blouse five minutes ago this remover worked but then so does seltzer if you apply enough of it when i tried it on an old stain a pair of jeans that had a spot on it from grease it didnt do anything the small bottle is handy for travel however so its good for when youre on the go overall its good for mild stains that just happened and you dont have anything else on hand for more stubborn stains id use something else,human

eres the next batch of reviews,ai
i am always looking for ways to curb my appetite so i thought i would give these a try you are to take so many pills each day i think that is hard to remember to take them and with the smell it is hard to force yourself to do but i was determined to give it a fair shake i did take them for a week and i did notice that it helped my appetite i am not sure if that is because of what is in them or because of the terrible smell who wants to eat after you have smelled that it did work though so you have to give some stars for that i defiantly noticed that i was going to the bathroom more often do the detox part worked as well this is not something i could add or take for my regular routine but if you are looking for a way to loose a few pounds or a way to detox for  a week or so this would work,human
i tried these pills to curb my appetite and while its tough to remember to take them every day i gave them a fair shot they definitely helped reduce my appetite though the smell is so bad it makes you not want to eat anyway it also helped with detox and bathroom trips but its not something i could add to my regular routine still if youre looking to lose a few pounds or detox its worth a try,ai
the first thing i love about this flat iron is that its cordless  its so nice to slowly getting rid of all of the power cords in my bathroomsthe iron itself is nice  heats up fastthe only thing i dont like is the size of the heating plate  im used to a longer one in my older flat iron so its taking me a bit to get used to this onesince i only straighten my bangs and every so often my entire head of hair the charge will last me a long time before i need to recharge it againnice flat iron thats easy to pack up and take on the go,human

i have been using this clear care product to clean and disinfect my contacts for years  it was recommended to me by my eye doctor when i was diagnosed with an eye infection i have not had an infection in the many years i have been using it i gave it 4 stars because the double pack only comes with one of the required cases i think there should be a case for each bottle included,human

there are 30 shimmery champagne gold boxes and 6 pages of 20 clear stickers totaling 120 stickers that come with this set they come in one piece and fold into a midsized boxi finally figured out how to fold the box bottom correctly the tabbed flaps go on the outside of the bottom and interlock into the other flaps they are not very sturdy so i suspect that 4 of the 120 stickers should be used to secure the 4 tabs as shown in one of my photosas long as one seals the bottom it should hold these are perfect for christmas gifts no wrapping needed or for cookies cupcakes or other classy gifts  each box should be able to fit about one pound of cookies depending on the size of the cookie or four regularsized cupcakes overall i think these are classy but i do not like the interlocking design of the bottom that requires stickers to provide holdthe current price of 1899 for 30 comes to  63 cents each which is reasonable,human
there are  champagne gold boxes and  clear stickers in this set theyre great for wrapping christmas gifts or cookies i like them but the bottom is a bit flimsy and needs extra reinforcement each box holds about a pound of cookies or four cupcakes good value for the price,ai

in addition to this new linea squeegee i have three oxo shower squeegees two of which are in service at any given time  my favorite  i have been using my  oxo squeegees anywhere from twice daily to once every other day depending on which shower im using and if im taking one or two showers per daythis unit comes in three piecesthe suction cup which has to be screwed into the stainless steel holder the stainless steel holder and the squeegee its features are partial crystallike handle rust proof stainless steel in brushed nickel finish for top of squeegee and suction hook slightly angled neckpros it has a long 10 blade so its great for wiping down my shower walls in a few passes the streamlined design looks sleek and elegant except for the lucitelooking handle the blade wipes smoothly and leaves my walls and shower doors streakfree the suction cup holds hard on my acrylic shower walls the blade appears to be replaceable by loosening two screws it comes with lifetime limited warranty guaranteed rustproof finish will replace if defective etccons to me this is heavy as it weighs in at 65 ounces excluding suction holder the handle looks like lucite or glass and if the suction cup gives way when its hanging i expect it to break when it hits the tub or shower bottom in fact the weight of this thing might nick the bottom of a porcelain tub only time will tell how this holds up the handle is too thin for grasping comfortably i wish the blade head were a little more angledcompared to my other squeegees i actually like this one the least mainly because of the thin fragile handle and the lack of a deeper angled headif i were to rate my preference in squeegees my first choice is the    47 stars and the   this squeegee  i rate 3 stars because the handle needs to be thicker and in stainless steel and the head more angled at the current price of 3999 plus 525 shipping i feel this is overpriced for its current design  nevertheless this squeegee is a looker and for those who have very large showers and baths this 10 blade makes short work of wiping away the water,human
ive been using oxo squeegees for years and this new linea one comes with a suction cup and a sleek design it works well but the handle feels fragile and its a bit heavy i still prefer my oxo squeegees but this one does the job,ai

i ordered the dental duty teeth whitening kit with 14 nonslip whitestrips  whitening accelerator light for review  i have had the opportunity to review several other whitening kits recently and this one by far has given my wife the best results  she has completed six 20minute sessions and already has had significant results  her additional thoughts compared to whitening pens or other trays these are much easier to use  you simply open the strips place the larger strip on your top teeth and the smaller strip on your bottom teeth  be sure to get all the way down to your gums and press the strip to adhere closely to your teeth  then insert the light into the mouth tray and turn it on the light has an automatic shut off at 10 minutes  just turn it back on once or twice dependent on the time you want to continue whitening  i would not recommend nor does the instructions recommend any longer than a half hour you do need to open the battery compartment to remove the paper between the two batteries to use it the photos show her before pic along with after the first use and then after 6 uses  the pictures were taken in the same spot in the house at the same time of day without a flash because these are strips versus a gel you do not have anything draining into your mouth while you are whitening  once you turn off the light and remove the tray there is some saliva mixed with white foam  she did not gag as much as with the gels it may be too early to tell but at this point this product has not caused any additional sensitivity to her teeth this kit is less expensive then many other less comparable whitening kitsoverall my wife is happy with the results she has seen already  she is looking forward to finishing a complete week once she does i will update my review with new after pictures,human

ive enjoyed the premade version so reading the powdered version wasnt the same didnt surprise me but a lot of reviews claim it tastes terrible and was so different they threw it away luckily i trusted the company and tried this product anyway contrary to those lowstar reviews i disagree that it doesnt taste similar and when mixed in a blender you almost cant tell the difference i use a small portable version  just using a shaker cup doesnt blend it as successfully but ok if you just need that satisfying shake to stave off snack cravings i find this meal replacement to be very satisfying and helps stop me from craving excess food i do 2 scoops to actually replace a meal 1 scoop to stave off snacking note the container says 12 c is for 8oz  23 c 2 scoops is for 12 oz not as creamy as the premade but probably not as many additives either unfortunately ive realized this product causes stomach discomfort so i cant enjoy it as often as i would like if you pop and enzyme pill and a probiotic pill just before it helps a lot with the gas,human
ive tried the premade version so i wasnt too surprised by the powdered version some reviews claim it tastes terrible but i had a different experience when blended the taste is almost identical to the premade version using a shaker cup doesnt blend it as well but it still works if you just need a quick satisfying shake to curb your hunger i use two scoops as a meal replacement and one scoop to stave off snacking its not as creamy as the premade version but it likely has fewer additives unfortunately ive experienced stomach discomfort so i cant use it as often taking an enzyme pill and a probiotic before helps with the gas,ai
a month ago my blood pressure was 14080 i had atrial flutter issues and my heart was acting bizarre i started taking a potassium and magnesium product and saw some results then i read the magnesium miracle by dr carolyn dean and stated taking this liquid magnesium i noticed good results with magnesium and now my blood pressure went down to 11060 so my nurse practitioner has halved my blood pressure medication and i have an appointment in a month to check it againif you do take this liquid magnesium and have high blood pressure make sure you are working with your doctor or nurse because your medication may need to be adjusted they also did an ekg on me and said my heart was normal and i told them well im taking magnesium they also did blood tests and said they were normal im not sure my nurse actually realized that the magnesium had lowered my blood pressure here are some of my experiences day by day at the startday 1 i took 14 teaspoon in 169 fluid ounces water it made me feel relaxed and i slept wellday 2 i got ambitious and took 12 teaspoon in a large container of iced tea and it only tasted a bit saltysipped over a couple of hours and it seemed to relax me and take the edge off my anxiety i thought it was giving me a lot of energy and made my heart beats really strongday 3 backed off a bit and took 14 teaspoon in a small amount of cranberry juice tasted salty and a bit bitter so didnt want to do that again decided it needed more liquid to make it palatableday 4 took 14 teaspoon in a pint 2 cups of coconut water my anxious thoughts stopped and my mind felt calm and almost as if my thoughts were not as loudday 5 took 14 teaspoon in 2 cups bottled water felt as if my system was detoxing and cleaning outday 6 felt like toxins were being released so drank more waterday 7 decided to try taking the magnesium liquid in capsules that way you cant taste and salty or bitter flavorday 8 while waiting to get capsules took 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in iced teaday 9 put 14 teaspoon magnesium in 3 veggie capsules swallowed them down with no issuessince then ive been taking 12 teaspoon magnesium liquid in five veggie capsules i fill them up with a syringe and take them right away not letting them sit around to dissolve it is a little extra effort but it keeps my atrial flutter under control and i feel better in general you may want to wipe the capsules off a bit after filling i just use a napkin that way you dont taste any of the liquid that is my best solution and how im going to continue to take this magnesiummy cautions are to start slow with drops or 14 teaspoon and work up slowly to 12 teaspoon a day also read the magnesium miracle to understand all the reasons to take this product and how to take it i would not recommend taking it straight always dilute it in at least 2 or more cups of water to make it palatable i will say this magnesium does not have laxative effects like other magnesium products do that is a good thing if you want to leave the houseso my experience has been positive please consult with your doctor before taking any supplements as your medications may need to be adjustedthe rebecca review,human
a month ago my blood pressure was  and i had heart issues i started taking a potassium and magnesium supplement and saw some improvement then i read the magnesium miracle by dr carolyn dean and switched to liquid magnesium i saw even better results and my blood pressure dropped to  my doctor reduced my blood pressure medication if you take this product and have high blood pressure consult your doctor as your meds might need adjustment i started slowly with small doses and gradually worked up to  teaspoon a day i also found that mixing it in coconut water helped calm my anxiety this magnesium doesnt have the typical laxative effect which is a plus overall my experience has been positive,ai

i am in my late 40s and cant see up close without my reading glasses i recently purchased a vanity mirror for my bathroom with 5x magnification i was horrified with what i saw the wrinkles didnt bother me  that goes along with age but i have lots of blackheads on my temples i couldnt see them before i have used the acne tools  the ones that look like dental tools and they work okay but those often leave behind temporary redness and you have to be precise about the location because of the small tips i found this ultrasonic cordless skin scrubber to be much more effective at getting rid of the blackheads and it doesnt leave behind any redness the end of it is about an inch and a half wide and it is able to scrape out the ugly blackheads you can see the dirt and grime on the tip after youve used it gross now as far as the scrubber goes it comes with a charger once it is on it has a vibration thing going on it heats up a little bit but not to the point where it is too hot to use or it burns i just can feel a little heat from it while it is in use theres a silicone cover to go over the metal end when it is not in use i am thrilled to have found thisi received this for free in exchange for my honest amp unbiased review my thoughts amp opinions are my own,human

for a basic eye mask of this style it is attractive budget friendly and are well made blocks out light via not only the outer material but also an internal piece of flannel stitched in im not sure why it has a pocket nothing to come out perhaps to add your own additional padding or black out material no ideanot adjustable but there is a lot of stretch how loose or tight this fits depends on your head i think it would be easy enough to make an adjustment to smaller size with a couple of quick stitches and i am not one to sew  i like that it isnt adjustable because usually the adjustable part snags my hair or i can feel it against my headhowever it being a little large to start is good because i have a large head my head measures 2375 this fits me without feeling too snug most feel way too snug but at some point in night i didnt like the feel not sure why yetmaterial is nice stitching is good comfortable when first on over course of night i could feel some pressure i eventually took it off i think these will be used for the occasional nap or when i need to just rest my eyes for me i think the pressure is due to the use of slim elastic and the opening to that pocket area i can just feel it at some point most all eye masks use slim elastic and what it does for me is create pressure across eye area where it pulls on the material through there but since this isnt too snug feeling i think it has more to do with that crease where the pocket it more material to smash against my faceso initially comfortable but then turns uncomfortable your experience may varyquality overall seems fine love the 3 pack love the floral design of the ones i selected it just isnt quite for me sadly ill try it a few more times if i experience anything else i will let you know in the mean time these are just ok hence 3 starsoddly my favorite sleep mask is one that no one else seems to like lol i keep waiting for it to come back so i can buy another or maybe i will figure out a way to make one for myself i am linking it in case you too have a big head and are bothered by the pressure of the slim elastic or at very least can see what i mean by largewide elastichttpswwwamazoncomdpb07rjqgv61,human
this eye mask is a solid option for a budgetfriendly sleep aid it blocks out light effectively thanks to its soft material and a flannel insert the mask fits comfortably on my head though its a bit loose which i prefer however the pressure caused by the elastic around my eyes became uncomfortable over time still its a good option for short naps or rest breaks,ai

in the bathtub this product works great it is much easier to use than the typical baby baths and can easily be used for an infant in the reclining position or an older baby in the supported sitting position  i love the fact that this takes up less room and makes it much easier to wash the baby directly in the bathtub the bottom seat part has rubber grips to prevent any sliding and the pillow portion floats nicelymy issue with this product is the fact that it holds a ton of water actually absorbs the water and then takes over 24 hours to dry i dont know why it wasnt made to be waterproof considering its used in a bathtub  that said it is still a great alternative to the traditional baby bath it takes up less space and allows the baby more freedom to move around during bath time,human
this bath seat is perfect for using in the bathtub with an infant its easy to store and much more compact than a traditional baby bath my only complaint is that it absorbs water and takes over  hours to dry,ai

while i love the convenience it is a lot cheaper to make this yourself the lime seems the most popular and it happens to be the easiest to make you can buy redmonds real salt use the fine ground popcorn variety as your sodium add some calm for magnesium and you can get potassium powder quite cheap you can get true lime powder for the lime flavoring and use a packet of steviaerythritol for the sweetener  voila if you want the raspberry just get some freeze dried raspberries and crush them into a powder and add a little,human
while convenient its much cheaper to make this yourself you can easily mix your own version with common ingredients like salt magnesium and lime powder its simple and costeffective,ai

these are great glasses to stash around the house because almost everyone can wear them and 150 can help almost everyone but are not too strong its fun to have three different color frames in colorcoordinated snug fitting protective cases the frames are lightweight and comfortable i dont expect them to survive being sat upon for instance the plastic feels like it would snap but they seem like they are durable i find that they are best for reading a book or a computer where you are not moving your head very much because the focal point is fairly specific once you turn your head a little bit the focal point changes more expensive glasses dont seem to do this all in all they are great for an emergency or  for instance  in the bathroom in case you need to read some fine print on a medication bottle etc,human

this came and i ordered it off experiencing it from a friends place it isnt as high as the old seat cushion i used but its definitely better quality and comfortable cushion it only has this one issue of a really weird smell it smelled like it when it came thought it would go away and is simply a new product smell but has yet to go away overall though good product do wish it had a thicker variation maybe it does and i missed it however,human

this brush is twosided the only thing i like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back however i would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puffthe other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and i have to stretch to reach my entire back in addition the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me there is already a hole in the handle for hanginga selfadhesive hook is provided for hanging although i did not use thatin summary this is functional but is the least favorite back washer i tried so far also the current price of 1499 is outrageous for this,human
this brush is twosided while i like the soft bristles on the back the head could be larger with more bristles the short handle and annoying rope loop also make it less convenient i dont think its worth the  price tag,ai
i really liked how this is a lot more comfortable than most rope most rope is really rough on your skin but this is really soft it would be much tougher to get rope burn than with most ropes but it holds really well too its also easy to tie knots withthis is about 32 feet of rope and so if youre going for some serious partner tying then you probably need about three skeins to completely tie someone upthe ends are taped and so theyll eventually fray if you plan on reusing this rope a lot then youll want to burn the ends so they dont fray its not ultrathick but this also means that it goes a lot farther than thicker ropethis comes in a few different colors and i like red the bestprosvery soft and comfortableperfect for adult restraint funholds fast without injuryattractive rope and colorsconsonly 32 feet 10 metersoomph gave me this rope to review,human
i love this rope its much softer than most ropes which makes it comfortable and easy to tie knots its  feet long so you might need more if youre planning on using it for extended sessions the rope is durable but the ends can fray so you might want to burn them to prevent that the red color is also a nice touch,ai
this is not three ply its two its usable in an emergency the texture is rough but really just a novelty gift that will gather dust until its regifted or thrown away the printing isnt centered per sheet so it loses some of it fun if it cant be read or the emoji is half missing still as a gag gift its good for a laugh not much else,human

i have this thermometer for 13 months and thanks god my kids are super healthy and they barely got sick my daughter got sick yesterday and had a very high fever and this thermometer was like a joke it gave me consecutive readings like 1045  1037  1019 1012 i tested both ear and forehead and no luck i knew she had a very high fever but i wanted to know exactly how much but with this thermometer that was not possiblei tried to call the customer service because they usually want to make the customer happybut not this timethey told me that as the warranty expired one month ago and they could not do anything i get thatbut i just thought a 24 thermometer will last more than one year so i guess i need to buy another thermometer but im not buying innovo ever again,human

i am surprised at how heavy and well made they are  they really do what they state  it is very easy now to lay in bed and watch tv without causing pain in my neck  i didnt really like reading with them because i need reading glasses so trying to wear two pair of glasses at the same time is just not comfortable for me  my husband liked them so much that even though he doesnt have a neck injury he wants a pair just because he said it was so comfortable watching tv laying flat on your back,human

ive had it for about a week and so far so good i think you never know with cats though you know what i mean i love kittens but i cant stand adult cats so finding out that some random cat has been messing with my outdoor plants certainly doesnt help their cause i thought about buying a zapper mat or motion detector spray but neither is workable for outside and although i personally hate cats im the only one in my family that feels this way so i thought this would be more humane it smells like big red gum to me  im very happy that it doesnt smell like a bunch of disgusting chemicals  and because it can be used outside and is safe for plants and is supposed to stick around even if it rains it seemed perfect also i hate the thought of me having to invest any money into cat related crap so this seemed like the most economical choice too i sprayed it every night the first 3 nights including one night when it rained and then i forgot to spray it the next day so its been every other day since so far my plants have remained untouched but i have no idea if its because of the spray or because the stupid cat just hasnt been around to harass my plants yet if my plants remain untouched after a month i think ill be convinced and begrudgingly buy this spray again when i run out,human
ive had this for a week now its still working but with cats its hard to tell i have a lovehate relationship with cats and one has been ruining my plants i wanted something more humane than a zapper mat or spray so i tried this it has a pleasant scent and doesnt smell like chemicals after a few nights of spraying my plants have remained untouched but im still not sure if its the spray or the cat just hasnt returned,ai

ive had insomnia for 2 decades  its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel even when im in a room far from elevators snack machines etclast week we went to atlantic city for a few days  i was lucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snackice machines but i knew that wouldnt be enough  i took a silk sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the beston the first night i was exhausted from driving and walking around all daynight yet i couldnt sleep then i remembered i had packed the mask and ear plugs so i climbed out of bed and got them from my bag  boy did the mask make it nice and dark  the earplugs blessedly gave me total silence as well i did not fall asleep immediately but sleep did come and that rarely happens for me on vacation  i usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake what a nice surprise to actually be able to get a few hours of sleepthe mask darkened the room tremendously even the next morning when i woke up to a sunny bright and cloudless day the room was still dark for me thanks to the mask  the mask was nice and soft and the mask itself was comfortable the band that went around my head was very tight and took a bit for me to get used to  the earplugs did a glorious job of drowning out my husbands horrific snoring  on the second night i was able to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed asleep through the night thanks to the mask that kept the light out of the room and the earplugs which by the way are very comfortable and flexible and soft  that kept the horrific snoring sounds as well as the maids cart noises from the hallway silentso glad i had the mask and earplugs with me i was actually able to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them,human
ive struggled with insomnia for over  years on vacation even in the quietest rooms its hard to sleep during a recent trip to atlantic city i used a silk sleep mask and earplugs and they made a huge difference the mask blocked out the light and the earplugs muted my husbands snoring helping me get some muchneeded rest theyre comfortable and im so glad i had them,ai

i have tried a few different facial scrubs and was very disappointed in this one  i have another tube of scrub similar to this one that i refuse to use  i will be purchasing my favorite real scrub when my current tube is nearly out  it is about half gone now so it shouldnt be too long  what i like about my facial scrub is that it has plenty of scrubbies in the paste that i put on my face  that way i can get all the dry flaky skin off my face clearing the way for new clean skin to be washed with a gentle soap and then moisturized with a light facial oil  i have dry skin as i am older  i dont have dual skin with oily and dry patches  i have dry skin period  the scrubbing granules in my favorite facial scrub ensures that all the old skin is gone  this product is so wimpy  it has barely anything scrubby in the paste meaning i would need to use about half the tube just to get enough scrubbies on my face to get rid of the dead dry skin on my face especially on my forehead and around my nose  just not worth it for my particular skin,human
after trying several facial scrubs im disappointed with this one unlike my favorite scrub which has plenty of exfoliating particles this one lacks enough scrubbies to remove dry skin effectively it doesnt work for my dry skin so i wont buy it again,ai

while it didnt miraculously make my teeth as white as snow it did make them a bit lighter the instructions it comes with leave much to be desired they are very vague it comes with whitening strips packets the light machine and silicone teeth mold first thing to do you have to open the battery holder there is a paper disk between two flat batteries to prevent them from running out since the button on the top is so sensitive small accidental touch will turn it onthe strips come in two sizes  short and long i tried both sizes on both sets of teeth and determined that longer goes on the top teeth and the short one goes on the lower teeth it would have been nice to have it confirmed in the instructions the whitening cycle times vary from 3045 minutes with the requirement not to eat or drink one hour afterwards the whitening light machine shuts off every 10 minutes on the dot as if to remind not to leave it in too long first time my teeth felt tingly and slightly cool but then nothing out of ordinary happened since it has to stay put in there for a while the saliva that collects behind the teeth has to go somewhere i swallowed it it was not overly unpleasant with slight traces of something its ok whitening kit but it does not perform miracle,human

product seems well made i have the one with extra padding the bad part is the strength of the massage  its simply too low its weaker than the handheld massage devices in my opinion i cannot see how anyone with a serious ailment gets any relief from this even at highest settings i did not feel it to be effective and heat was not working at all or felt like itdoes not look like it will be comfortable or recommend to put it on a sitting position this also occupies considerable amount of space so if you have people sitting at same location you will need to move it each time,human
the product seems wellbuilt and i have the version with extra padding however the massage strength is too weak for my likingits even less powerful than handheld devices even at the highest setting it didnt feel effective and the heat function didnt work for me either i wouldnt recommend using it while seated and it takes up quite a bit of space so youd have to move it around if there are others sitting nearby,ai
these are super cheap plastic the head doesnt even move just the handle not worth it,human
the quality is poorits made of cheap plastic the head doesnt move only the handle does not worth the price,ai

these socks are great the fabric is soft smooth lovely feels really nice next to my skin i love how colorful  fun these compression socks are because all ive found up until now were just drab tan black or white stockings that looked hideous just because i have peripheral vascular return issues with my lower extremities feet calves doesnt mean i want to look so frumpy wearing the traditional compression hose these are so cute bright  colorful the only downside is that i am wearing these due to leg swelling  when my calves are real swollen which is often unfortunately the design on some of these socks gets stretched out causing you to lose the very thing that makes these so pretty the design stretches enough to where it looks blurry to completely lost on some designs  not so colorful this hasnt happened on all the socks ive purchased from this maker i have about 6 pairs but definitely on some if youre on the thin side or dont experience much swelling this probably wont be a problem at all a solution to this would be if the company made them in a couple of sizes like small  large,human
these socks are fantastic the fabric is soft smooth and feels great on my skin i love how bright and fun the designs aremuch better than the boring tan black or white ones ive seen before theyre a great option for compression socks especially since i struggle with leg swelling the only downside is that when my calves are really swollen the design stretches and loses its vibrancy this doesnt happen with all the pairs i bought but its an issue with some if you dont experience swelling or are thinner this likely wont be a problem it would be nice if the company offered different sizes to help with this,ai
works greattip dont advance the dosage too fast or it can make you sicker as it activates dormant detox pathways and dont give up on it if you feel worse just cut back until you find the easy safe dose then let your cravings for it control your intake from there your mind will think about it and taste crave it when its time use this with remyte it works well together their other product dont make much sense to me ymmvit tastes exactly like magnesium chloride so i dont believe the sellers claim that chloride is removed,human

this could be a useful mini razor for traveling i say could since i cant say how well it shaves  i was never able to get it to turn on i initially thought it was shipped with a discharged battery which is sometimes the case with rechargeable products however after letting it charge for a few hours it still would not turn on the shaver got rather warm while charging and the charge indicator light turned on but those were the only indications of lifethe design is something ive not come across before its a rotary shaver but the heads are arranged in a straight line the heads are smaller than is customary on a rotary the construction is all plastic and feels rather cheap still it has some nice grip points and feels pretty good in hand as a travel shaver the lightweight nature and the smaller size could be plussessince it failed to turn on at all the only rating i can give is 1 star a shame since i would have liked to see the shaving performance of the lineararranged rotary heads,human
this could be a handy travel razor though i cant say how well it shavesi never got it to turn on i thought the battery might be dead but after charging it it still wouldnt work the shaver warmed up and the charge light came on but that was all the design is unique with the rotary heads in a line instead of the usual circular arrangement but it feels cheap and plastic if it had worked the small size and light weight would have made it a good travel option but since it didnt turn on i can only give it  star,ai

overall its not bad i have had better tasting types of hydration packets or powders see nuun i think that while the salt count is fairly low compared to other brands the saltiness stands out more with this brand overall it does what it needs to do and i feel equally as good after my runs as i do with other brands i think based on price alone i would purchase again since this brand appears to be slightly cheaper than other brands for the quantity offered overall i would give a 75 out of 10,human

update  after 6 months of on and off usage i would guess about 125 wearings the main band hookandloop velcro is one brand of hookandloop type closure is shot  the 2 straps start separating as soon as they are attached one good cough or bending over and scritchit pops open  i am most certainly not a big person so i am not stressing the connection in that respect all hookand loop does wear out the hooks start to get straightened out with repeated pulls of the loop side and subsequently they stop grabbing and holding the loop  the highest quality products have thick stout hooks that last a very long time  i feel that should you plan on wearing this item everyday you may be buying 2 or 3 a year  aside from this issue rendering the brace unwearable i still feel this is a fantastic braceoriginal postthis is not the first posture corrector i  have purchased through amazon but it will be the last  this is a very well engineered and constructed product and i commend the sellermanufacturer on delivering a corrector that actually worksi had been going through progressive slouching shoulder slump and fhp forward head positionto the layman like me that just means not looking straight ahead but down to differing degrees  i had been told that i was looking down all the time  in actively assessing myself i found that to be true  this observation of slumping over and head position led me to understand why i was going through progressive upper back shoulder and neck pain  every morning and evening i was on an acetaminophen and ibuprofen regimenmy previous posture corrector experience was awful  poorly engineered uncomfortable and one size fits all seems to be the normin receiving this product box i was a bit apprehensive  i didnt want further disappointment  i gave this purchase a 4 star review for two reasons  i really want to give a 5 star review because the product actually works as advertised but there are a couple of issues if i could give a 45 star review i would for better or worse positive change occurs on amazon through the process of accurate and honest reviewsmy first reason for not rating my experience as a 5 may seem petty to some but i feel it has importance  on opening the box and removing the brace there was not a single stitch of product literature included  in my humble opinion basic information regarding the product itself guarantee explanation with returnrefund information and some basic seller contact information should have been included  there were none of the pages that can be seen on the amazon website that are just great  copies of the photos and fitting instructions should also have been with the product i was going back and forth between my computer and my bathroom mirror to assure proper fitment when i first put this on it did not feel right and i found that i was wearing it too low by looking at the photo of the model  for future reference when not logged on to the computer having package inserts would be fantasticnow to the corrector once i was properly fitted it was immediately obvious that this device was going to prove beneficial  when i first strapped it on it seemed that i would only receive moderate correction  i realized that i was not holding my shoulders neck and head up straight and in proper alignment before stretching and attaching the shoulder straps to the belly band  upon doing this correctly a significant amount of support was felt  by pulling pretty tight on the straps while in proper posture before attachment of the bands my alignment is now perfect my posture without the corrector was poorbut not as bad as i have seen with other people in order to retain proper alignment with the corrector i had to give the straps a pretty good stretch  i am 51134 tall and 190 pounds  it is only reasonable that the device straps will have to be pulled tighter for a bulkier person there is just going to be more physical resistance to correction if you are smaller than me such tension may not be requiredthis is where my second issue is keeping me from a 5 star review comes up  for those of use requiring extra tension on the straps to maintain proper spinal alignment the straps can 34cut34 into the armpits to an uncomfortable degree  some sort of well designed underarm cushioning would be greatly appreciatedlastly i can only wear this brace for about 2 hours before my back muscles start aching  i do not consider this to be a negative in any wayactually it is quite the opposite  this lets me know the brace is working as advertised  those muscles in my back have been stretching and stretching over the years and are at the heart of my poor posture  they are not enjoying being 34recompressed34  tough  over time muscle fibers begin to grow together  this corrector i feel will facilitate just that take tension off the brace as soon as you begin to feel any of the aching i have described above  continued use after that point will cause discomfort for some time after the brace is removed  for some people i imagine this period of initial correction may be as short as 45 minutes to an hour perhaps even less for the elderlyi am going to get one for my 70 year old mother if she gives in to trying it it takes time to gain new muscle memory  the longer you use the device every day the length of time you will be able to wear it comfortably will most likely extend in using this corrector these aching muscles will begin to calm down over time  the support is not just holding things in place it is forcing the body to improve itself  i fully believe that actual postural healing will take place and down the road i will only need the support as a  reminder rather than a maintaineri wear a tshirt every day and even when tightly tucked in the corrector is virtually invisible underneath it  from when i first put the corrector on in the morning i do not take it off until bedtime  i simply go through comfortable cycles of tensioning the main strap and releasing it when i feel it is neededthe device is lightweight and unobtrusive  only the tightest or sheerest of clothing would give away its presencebravo tigoof  you really have a winner here and i highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing postural issues such as mine slouching forward head position and shoulder slumping and suffering from the chronic neck and shoulder pain that i was  as an aside my working at the computer for any extended period of time would get to feeling fiery in the upper back i dont do computer work now without the brace  and no longer experience that discomfort i highly recommend this support to long duration computer usersthis is a fantastic product you should feel very secure in purchasing  the few negative things i mentioned are more than likely issues specific to me or perhaps to other people my size or larger  i am confident that if you order the correct size and find the justright fit for you this corrector will prove itself to be quite an asset  if you dont feel just that way contact the seller  they are fantastic to work with  i cant wait for my few issues to be dealt with in some fashion for all future purchasers so i can i can come back and give this product a solid 5 star rating i couldnt be more pleased with my purchasegood day  good backstlaffoon,human
update after about  months of occasional use around  times the velcro closure on the band is worn out the straps keep separating even with minimal movement im not a big person so its disappointing that the velcro doesnt hold up if you wear this brace daily you may need to buy replacements despite this the brace works great for improving posture and relieving pain its wellengineered and effective id give it a star rating if i could the only negatives are the lack of instructions and discomfort from the straps overall though this product has been a gamechanger for my posture and pain relief highly recommended,ai

solves a common problem almost everyone who has ever used an ace bandage for more than a day or two has lost some if not all the clips and dropping a clip onto a hard floor and accidently stepping on it renders it useless so what do you do when you need to use that ace bandage but have too few or worse yet no clips at all ive tried using safety pins as an alternative when i have no clips but found that is really not a good solution as it does not hold the end of the bandage evenly this pack of 50 clips will last a long time and im glad that its a pack of 50 as they are not really durable so they have to be replaced fairly often like 34 days but they are a much better alternative than to safety pins and certainly buying another expensive ace bandage they also come in handy to use on a really wide ace bandage as the number of clips supplied by ace seems inadequate im glad i bought them,human

i do a lot of research before buying or trying products and its been a while since ive had a product that made me so happy  i think this is a great value productwhen i first started working with a personal trainer a few years ago one of the first things he made me buy was a foam roller34why34  i asked34so you can work out knots in your muscles  trust me youll want it34so i ordered one of those giant long big blue foam rollers that they have in gyms  it was cumbersome but it was effective  i didnt realize how tight my muscles were until i rolled on these rollers and let the weight of my body press against the roller  it was so good but so painful  and as much as i liked using it i hated storing it  i was living in a loft at the time and that thing was really unsightlythen i saw this 3 in 1 roller and was really excited to try it  the 3 in 1 roller has basically 3 rollers that stack neatly inside one another  theres the outer roller most similar to what i had before a gear shaped roller for more targeted pressure points and a rolling massage stick  its shorter but im still able to fit both legs on the roller  it also cost the same as my giant long blue tube roller  i like that its compact enough to hide from sight when not in use  i like the firmness of the large roller and small roller and the whole kit feels very sturdy and well constructed  the only slightly annoying thing is that the massage stick fits very snug into the gear roller so it takes a lot of effort to pull out and i worry whether the handle might break over time  better that than too loose and constantly falling out i guessfoam rolling works based on the idea that pressure applied to certain body parts helps to work out knots and relieve pain  until i started using foam rollers i didnt realize how many knots i had in my body  i do stretches regularly but you still dont get it all outthere are a number of great roller positions you can use  the ones i find most effective are for my quads and hamstring  you prop your roller onto your hamstrings or quads and hold a low plank with the weight centred over the roller  hold position for a few seconds at a time where you feel pain  discomfort and slowly roll up and down every part of your legs  the same concept works with calves and glutes  just roll slowly onto the roller putting as much weight as you can on the point of contact between the roller and your bodymy back and neck are often sore so ill lie on my back with the large roller tucked under my lower back and then arch backwards  with the gear roller i like propping it under my neck and pushing down on the pain pressure points  ive also run the massage stick up and down sore spots on my neck and along my shouldersoverall there are lots of uses and plenty of exercises you can look up online  its a great way to work out muscle knots and relieve soreness and tightness from exercise  it also loosens your muscles and prevents tearing  i received a review sample of this roller for my honest opinion and i wouldnt hesitate to purchase another if i were to misplace this one,human
after a lot of research im so happy with this product a few years ago a personal trainer introduced me to foam rolling to work out muscle knots i hated the large cumbersome roller i had then i found this in roller set which is compact sturdy and effective it includes a standard roller a gearshaped one for targeted pressure and a massage stick it works great for relieving muscle tightness and soreness,ai

as a fulltime caregiver of a person suffering the symptoms of alzheimers ive been struggling with finding good products for her dual incontinence issues  after finding a great adult diaper that holds her through the night weve noticed that the diapers have an unpleasant smell to them worth a bit of odor if i dont have to do laundry of the complete bedding 12x per day  my sister works as a medical assistant and she told me that this is what all the medical assistants keep at their desks to eliminate odors whenever an exam room needs it  i ordered this product as well as another one by a different manufacturer  hands down this is the far superiior product same as used at the hospital  while they both worked on the odor this one only takes 12 sprays in the room and the odors disappear and the best part is the small fragrance you smell once you spray goes away and it just smells fresh  i cannot recommend this product enough,human

very big bigger than i thought it does hold a lot of oils but some of my bottles are bigger than doterra so the bigger bottles take up more space and the next area is not available therefore cutting down on the number of oils in the case i am also curious how the foam holds up or breaks down when oils get on it is there a replacement for the foam insert the case is sturdy and i appreciate the handle makes it a lot easier than the cardboard box i had them in,human

i dont know why people were complaining about set up i set my scale on a hard floor and it took me all of 10 seconds to connect it and then it told me to weigh myself it was absolutely easythe sleek design is so attractive the bottom of the scale is covered in a bubble look and it really does look futuristic this connected nicely to my fitbit and my fitness pal infact i weighed myself and it auto uploaded without me touching a button so that was niceim really glad i invested the money for this scale it seems to be accurate seeing as how i was just weighed at the doctors office 1 week ago and have lost a few lbs off that number which i am trying to do so as far as accuracy goes this seems to be right on keyi need to keep it hidden from my kids though because it says not to be used by anyone under 10 and the look is just too temptingthe display is nice it recognizes you by the account you set up and calls you by your initials you can also set up multiple users i am really happy with this purchase  so far update may 6 2014  got on the scale this morning and it read one weight  which i thought was impossible  so i got back on  it was 4 lbs down  huh  got on again 2 lbs up  got on again  12 lbs down  this scale is messed up and i am returning it  i know my body fluctuates but not like this and not in a 5 min time frame  the scale integrates nicely with mfp but make sure you watch it for inconsistencies mine is a white one  and i originally really liked it  however ive weighed myself only a handful of times since i got it and it fluctuates like mad,human

i own and have been using straight razors for years i figured i would try a shavette for those times when i dont feel or have the time to strop or touch up the edge on the standard straight edge i bought two of them to see which one i would like both are the 34push type34this one is all coated metal and is heavier than my standard straights even heavier than my spartacus str8s but the main reason i am writing this review is how even the blade sits in this unit with this unit the blade fits perfectly even in the holder the heavier metal really holds the blade in place beautifully tight and perfectly exposed the other shavette i got was the cut throat with a multi colored wood handle from ebay for 15the handle was nice but the blade holder metal was quite a bit thinner and the edge of the blade was not evenly exposed that is because the two metal edges where the blade comes through are not even one edge is higher than the other and not parallel from one side to the other as the metal is thin i tried to bend the two edges so they would line up better no luck once metal is bent it is hardened summary this matte slide out is a higher quality unit with quality control that is necessary for the blade to be exposed evenly  fun to shave with and convenient,human

the first issue was that the soap didnt come out of the wand easily solved by poking a larger hole in the soap wand using a paring knife second issue was that even after creating a larger opening for soap to come out the sponge was too thickdense for the soap to saturate sufficiently again an easy fix  i simply used my paring knife to make a small slit in the center of the sponge at this point despite having to make these minor adjustments i was still ok with the product because hey this scrubber is always in my sink and i always have a knife that needs cleaning so despite the fact that a product should perform as intended without the need for alterations the literal 5second investment was worth it in a world where scotchbrite refills have apparently gone the way of the dodo but i digress the real issue  and this one is insurmountable  is that the flipping sponge pops off of the little bracket that attaches it to the wandeverysingletime honestly i hate stinky sponges that sit in and around sinks so much that i actually thought about purchasing some sort of waterproof glue to reattach the sponges to the bracketsbut i mean cmon anyway total pass on this one,human
i encountered a few issues with this product initially the soap wouldnt come out of the wand but that was fixed by making the hole larger then even after that the sponge was too thick for the soap to soak through properly a small slit in the sponge helped but the main issue was that the sponge kept popping off the wand unfortunately i had to let it gotoo many issues for me,ai

the taste is good the ingredients are healthy and ketofriendly other than sucralose i have consumed bulletproof coffee regularly for years so i am used to this type of coffee one issue is the price which is currently 350 per cup if you have four cups per day that is 14 per day and this pack will only last five days you can make coffee at home add your own butter mct oil and collagen at a cost of 040  1 per cup where this product makes sense is when you are away from home such as in the office or while traveling for that use case this product is good spending 350 on a cup of coffee is too much thoughthe other issue is that this product is not ketofriendly since it has sucralose which will spike insulin the amount of sucralose in this is not disclosed,human

i have owned many different pill cutters over the years and this is the best one ive ever used by far it is constructed of medicalgrade bpafree plastic and its stainlesssteel blade is thin and sharp this allows it to cut pills in half without turning them into crumbs and dust which happens all too often when such blades are too wide and too dullit is typical for pill cutters to have a vshape for holding pills of various sizes in place so that is not in itself a unique feature however what is a new feature to me at least is that this pill cutter provides a highly visible painted line running down the center of the v space this mark allows the user to accurately position pills which contain an indented break line in their center such that this break line is in alignment with the cutters blade this makes it additionally likely that this particular type of pill will be split cleanly in half with no wasted crumbsthis pill cutter is conveniently larger than any other pill cutter ive owned which are usually about 1inch x 25inch in size this one is 15inch x 35inch making it easier to handle for anyone who suffers from arthritisfinally as an extra little plus this handy device is surprisingly attractive due to its sleek design and the fact that it is a pleasing aqua colorall in all i find this to be an excellent product that i would not hesitate to recommend to family or friends,human

these are a great option if youre a paleo fan and trying to eat only whole and natural foods are they like a candy bar like most 34healthy34 protein barsno definitely not and this wouldnt be for you i find the flavor good they satisfy my hunger for a few hours and they are great to have on hand for when you need a high protein snack and need something quick as they suggest you really should put them in the microwave for 10 secs before eating that makes all the difference they are a bit greasy when you first open the package which is a little odd to me but i just overlook it and dig in the texture is pretty hard unless you heat them up a bit the chocolate was my favorite but all 3 flavors are good the mint is pretty minty so if youre not a fan you likely wont enjoy it,human
these are an excellent choice for paleo enthusiasts looking to stick to whole natural foods they dont taste like a candy bar which might disappoint those seeking something like traditional protein bars however i find them satisfying and filling for several hours its a great option for a quick highprotein snack heating them in the microwave for 10 seconds as suggested improves the texture although they can feel a bit greasy upon opening the chocolate flavor is my favorite and the mint flavor is very mintyso it may not be for everyone,ai

oil of oregano is a very potent antiviral and antibacterial  ive got oregano oil in a liquid bottle and in softgels  i cant tolerate the liquid unless its diluted because its so hot  these little tubes of oregano oil are convenient and taste good but you only get 50mg of oregano oil per tube  one softgel of oregano oil usually delivers about 150mg  if you dont want that much then these tubes are good alternative  i found that though they taste good getting all the oil out of the tube was impossible  theres always an amount left in the bottom,human

these wipes are barely suitable for use they are tiny and dry they barely remove dirt i guess you get what you pay for,human
these wipes are too small and dry to be effective they hardly remove any dirt but theyre inexpensive,ai
it seemed to work pretty well for the first year the batteries had to be replaced after 1 year give or take a few days so i was happy about that but one very disconcerting thing i noticed was that it would give me a different weight when it was moved to different areas of the floor which i then knew i wouldnt buy it again but then i started to notice inconsistencies between what my scale said and what my doctors office scale and even what my sisters bathroom scale weighed me i also used it to monitor the weight of a 13 yr old cat which is even more important to me than keeping track of my own weight now after less than only 2 years and its stopped working altogether which is completely unacceptable,human

ill first begin by saying that probably a good thing i didnt like this product therefore it didnt end up using it i say this because i would have ended up scarring the heck out of my face had i used it even onceheres what i did like about this productthe case the case was truly beautiful it was as if it were from i dont know the 40s or the 50s when they used to make things really well and a truly was beautifulthe price point for around 8 i thought that there was a lot within the set as far as various implements so therefore i thought insofar as money wise you got good bang for your buck as a consumerhere is what i did not like about this setextraordinarily extremely and exceptionally dangerous when im telling you these things are surgically sharp im telling you these tools are surgically sharp  you could so easily hurt yourself and certainly scar your skin using any of these tools and i would not recommend it for the removal of blackheads or relief of pimples  no one perhaps not even a trained professional could wield these tools in the safe mannerlastly one of the implements that i managed to pull out of course i stabbed myself in the process but thats beside the point the head of this tool fell off immediately when i pulled it out i looked everywhere on the floor for it couldnt find out where fell to this day havent found it cuz i thought to myself maybe id glue it back but even still a brand new item should not be falling off like that regardless if if youre easily able to glue it back on or not so thats why i say that it has the illusion of being high quality but the reality it really wasnt the highest quality producti suppose because of the beauty of it it could be a gift  but im telling you that it is so dangerous that i wouldnt recommend it to anybody and i certainly wouldnt buy it again,human
i initially liked this product but im glad i didnt use it as its extremely sharp and dangerous the tools are surgicalgrade sharp making them unsafe for personal use despite the beautiful case i wouldnt recommend this for blackhead removal or pimple relief,ai

this is a great little straightener if you understand that it is not intended to be your everyday straightener i bought it for camping i charged it in texas and i used it 7 days later in a colorado national park it still had a full charge but after using it for 15 minutes it was at 50 charge it says it heats up to 205c but it definitely does not get that hot i have fine straight hair already and this does the job for me but it will take at least twice the time as my regular babyliss i think someone with coarse curly or super long hair would be frustrated the plates are only two inches long i also plan to put it in my car for those times i want to freshen my hair after work or after working out it comes with a usb charging cord so i can charge it in my car overall it is a very good purchase if you use it for traveling or small touch ups,human

no complaints about this turmeric powder the aroma when opening the bag was very rich the taste was also excellent and not at all muted as some turmerics ive used i use this mainly with rice or rice substitutes such as wheat berries couscous and the like and both the taste and the strong yellow color make for a tasty dishi like that while it is priced similar to a bulk item it comes in three fairly small 4 oz bags that allows for cost savings by buying in bulk but the smaller packages help maintain the freshness until its ready to be usedfresh tasty and a good value hits all the right marks,human

i took off one star due to the cotton wrapping around each earplug it was very hard to get off it took a while for just one  i just found out why  it was very hot yesterday i opened one this morning only 70 in here now and the cotton came right off i added a star back on to 5  the cotton is not a problem  i think the reason noted in packaging for the cotton was not to use plastic more earth friendly however there was no need to wrap these in anything  i use macks they come open in a row they are a different material but same could have been done with these  i finally unwrapped one and it fit and molded into my ear nicely,human
this product offers great value for its price considering the amount of mg per capsule,ai
super thick layers that really dont lie flat against your face found this mask to be fairly uncomfortable and always choose another over it,human
i deducted one star because the cotton wrapping on each earplug was difficult to remove taking a while for just one however i found that in cooler temperatures the cotton came off easily after realizing this i added the star back the cotton wrapping might be an ecofriendly choice to avoid plastic though i feel it wasnt necessary i finally managed to unwrap one and it fit comfortably and molded nicely into my ear,ai

the mask has thick layers that dont lie flat against your face making it uncomfortable for long wear i prefer other masks over this one,ai
oh gosh oh gee oh mymy sister was just saying they got her husband a foot massager at one of the membership club stores and that they felt it was a waste of money this one isnt even though i got it at a discount in exchange for a fair unbiased honest review i am amazed by this  i have never had a foot massage like this  it has a bunch of functions air pressure makes the massage harder or milder start out low and there is also a function that gives you the option of high and low levels of heat  there is also a kneading massage and a shiatsu massage as well as an air pressure massage and yes there is a major difference with the shiatsu massage hitting all sorts of areas between and around the areas that the kneading massage hits there is a timer and an auto function that cycles through other functions but that does not seem to include the shiatsu massage this is really really pink  it is also very high tech with glowing lights at the front the first thing i actually noted was how heavy it is the handle in the top of the box is really helpful the drawing says the covers in the foot areas are detachable but i didnt see how to detach them so suggestions would be welcomei dont want to wreck my new toy  or maybe it will be in another review  ive had it turned off for 10 minutes now and can still feel a difference in my feet and lower legs,human
these drops are a delightful little treat the taste is pleasant and they effectively work when dealing with occasional bloating or gas,ai
my grandmother used to buy these and they really work and dont smell like the thing youre trying to cover up and food like most other sprays do  i dont want to smell something yummy and bathroom smells mixed together its disturbing thats why i like this stuff it does a good job of masking the smell and not being gross i have yet to get tired of it either  not sickly sweet or too floral it is a strong smell but not overpowering  very well balanced,human
wow my sister recently shared that her husband bought a foot massager from a membership club which they thought was a waste of money this one however is an exception even though i received it at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review i am truly impressed the variety of functions such as air pressure for adjustable intensity kneading and shiatsu massage provides a comprehensive experience the timer and auto function make it userfriendly and the glowing lights add a touch of tech appeal although heavy the massager is built well and the handle is convenient the covers for the foot areas are detachable but i have not figured out how to remove them yet after using it i feel a noticeable difference in my feet and lower legs,ai

i love music and as one of my favorite music professors always says live music is always better than dead musicjust in the past year and a half ive really started getting into the live concert scene let me rephrase that ive started getting into the live rock concert scene ive always been a frequent attendee of wind ensemble and orchestra concertsive also always have had a mild case of tinnitus or ringing in the ears this ringing is evidence of hearing damage and it irreversibleneedless to say going to rock concerts without hearing protection left me with a few nights of extraringing ears and almost certainly hearing damage as wellmore recently ive actually been experiencing perforations of my ear drum and even just this year a full burst because of all of this i decided to get my hands on a pair of ear plugsthe problem for me is that i cant just wear any old foam earplugs im a bit of an audiophile and those regular earplugs just make everything sound muffled which for me defeats a lot of the purpose of going to a live show in the first placethats where the downbeats come in they are a special type of ear plug that lets most of the sound profile in but cuts the volume to a safe level they advertise 18db noise reductionspoiler alert they really do work as advertised i wore them at a five hour metalcore concert this past weekend and im happy to report that i didnt have ringing ears after the show i also was able to hear all of the frequencies just quieter i could still feel the music and it wasnt quiet by any means but it was not a damaging loudnessone thing to note is that unfortunately these earplugs cut out conversation almost completely at a concert event conversations are hard at a concert event generally because of all the noise but these made it noticably harder to hear i found myself removing one plug if i wanted to talk to my friendsrelated to conversation these earplugs tend to make you talk even quiter than normal because of how they sit in your ear canal you end up hearing your voice pretty loud in your head so you talk quiter to other people with them in its really a minor inconvenience though considering that these save your hearing again you can just remove one when you feel the need to talk and that solves the problemthe downbeats fit pretty comfortably which is to say that i could wear them for the whole five hours of the show to me they feel like inear headphones you definitely notice a pressure in the ear canal but its not terribly unpleasant that means a lot from me because i despise in ear headphones because i find them incredibly uncomfortableluckily even though these earplugs sit very similar in the ear to inear headphones they stay in much better one of my biggest fears in getting fancy earplugs was that they would fall out while i danced jumped headbanged and otherwise moshed at the show i am happy to report that these earplugs stayed in very well and i never once had a problem with them slipping out or feeling loose these are earplugs that i would recommend for metal hardcore rock punk etc showsthe downbeats also dont stick out from the ear very far which is nice because you dont have to worry about catching a bump from the crowd and shoving the earplug too deep into the ear damaging the ear drum rock shows get intense this also means that the downbeats are pretty inconspicuous so you dont have to worry about everyone in the crowd knowing youre wearing earplugsi didnt have any problems removing the downbeats from my ears after the show although i have read reviews that said people did have some trouble with this the included carrying case is also a really convenient storage system for when you take the plugs out which is always a bonus its made of metal and could definitely take a beating although i didnt subject it to oneoverall these are highly recommended by me i liked everything about the product and i look forward to taking them to more shows in the future but even if you choose not to get this product or if it doesnt work for you wear earplugs to concerts people,human
this product works as advertised i use it to spray my gym sneakers and it neutralizes the smell effectively with minimal scent,ai
this is the best stain remover ever,human
i am a fan of live music especially live rock concerts after years of attending these events and dealing with tinnitus i decided to invest in earplugs as an audiophile i needed something that wouldnt muffle the sound and these earplugs deliver they provide noise reduction while preserving the sound quality after using them at a metalcore concert my ears didnt ring and i could still hear everything clearly just quieter they may make conversations harder to hear but they are essential for protecting your hearing at loud concerts the earplugs stayed in place despite active movement which is a plus theyre discreet comfortable and come with a convenient carrying case highly recommend them for anyone attending loud live music events,ai
does the job removes the lint,human
this is an outstanding stain remover  it works wonders,ai
when your physical therapist only gives you one sleeve per week this product is well worth the money so you can change your sleeve whenever you want to you can also snip a much smaller hole for your thumb so it stays on and lasts longer  after surgery on each thumb i needed to be in a brace for several months i love that i can make them the length i want  you can wash them but they come out all raveledjust cut yourself a new sleeve,human
this product does exactly what it promises removing lint effectively,ai
perfect fit with my okley radar the rubber is a bit less soft than okleys original but it works perfectly very happy 10 years after buying my okleys is like having bought a new one,human

i have used styling products my whole life but only started using a flat iron a few years ago  i like that one and yet thought there might be something better especially since ive been using the flat iron for both straightening and light waves of latei love the sleek all black look of this iron  its a little smallerslimmer than my old one and it has a nice long swivel cord  it heats up superquickly as promised and the auto shutoff is a nice feature  unfortunately the coloring of the temperature display makes it very difficult to read the numbers especially as i am getting ready in the morning without my reading glasses  note you will have to press both the power button and the temp button at the same time to switch the temperature reading from c to ffor straightening my hair i found that the iron generally performed well  i didnt really see any different between the floating plates of this iron and my old iron but still the iron worked well for my fine hair  i had more trouble using this iron to create waves  the sleek black case is aesthetically pleasing but has no real tractiongrip making it hard to twirl the iron for curling  although there are small grips at the end of the iron these arent tapered and dont work well at all  adding to the challenge is that the plates go all the way to the end so when gripping the tips and trying to turn the iron i burned myself several timesif you plan to use this iron for straightening only it may work for you but if you are looking for a more versatile styling product i would not recommend this iron,human
these replacements fit perfectly with my oakley radar the rubber is slightly firmer than the original but still works wonderfully after 10 years its like having a brandnew pair,ai
great bottles perfect for making recipes to use for the whole family the dark color helps to ensure those oils sensitive to direct light are protected roller heads snap in and work great,human
i have been using styling products for years and i was looking for a flat iron that performs well for both straightening and creating light waves this one heats up quickly and has a sleek black design with a long swivel cord however the temperature displays color makes it hard to read while the iron works fine for straightening it lacks the necessary grip for curling if youre looking for an iron for straightening only this one could work for you but for more versatile styling it may not be the best choice,ai
came doa currently talking to them on a replacement,human

this product smells wonderful oddly as you can see the label claims it to be unscented and the listing claims it to be scented i believe it might be mislabeled but it doesnt matter because this product is very good you spritz it on to the stain and work it into the fabric after letting it sit for a couple of minutes run water through the fabric or blot with a wet clothi found that with most stains i had to do that twice but on the good side its clear that this is safe for a lot of hand washables as long as you are gentle and dont rub the stain too hardive had those big commercial brands of stain removers make things worse by fading the area that you spray them in that was not the case with this product it might not be as effective but its not going to damage your clothes if you have something delicate andor your clothes are a huge investment invest in this product as wellanother plus is that the 2 oz spray is good for travelso this might be a product that you need or another one might be best for you hopefully this review has helped you to decide,human
this is my favorite product and i was thrilled to find it again after it disappeared from stores its fatfree and delicious unlike any other brand ive tried the six bottles arrived quickly and in perfect condition,ai
my father has macular degeneration this vitamin doesnt seem to help that much but then this supplement is meant as a preventive measure and is less effective once you have a deteriorating condition given that most of us are on our computer screens or cell phones for more than 10 hours a day i notice that i have more floaters when i dont take this vitamin its easy to swallow and best taken with food over the long term i dont know how effective it is but taking lutein for your eyes certainly cant hurt and im glad it works on my floaters,human
the scent of this product is amazing though it seems to be mislabeled as unscented i find it effective at removing stains without damaging delicate fabrics it works well on handwashables and i appreciate the travelfriendly 2 oz spray size while it may not be as effective as stronger stain removers its safe for most fabrics,ai

this will fit large heads i have a 2375 head and this has plenty of stretch and adjustability it can easily go larger than my head measurementsthe soft foam cups are comfortable the exact fit will vary i find they block out all the light and unless i am resting my head in such a way to push on them there is very little light that will sneak through im a side sleeperthe soft foam cups allow the eyes to breathe lashes dont get smashed eye creams likely stay in placealthough stretchy and adjustable it is hard for me to find that sweet spot where it isnt too snug that it creates creases come morning nor too loose that it doesnt fall off migrate away from my eyes i found the snug fit worked better as it kept the mask from rotating in the night and off my eyes but i wake with indents i cant have thatother aspect that has troubled me is that sometimes it gets caught in my hair the spot that has the adjustment hardware is prone to snagging my hairso i go back to my old trust stand by which is a tube of material it looks like a headband and it continues to be my most favorite sleep mask of all time if it rotates it doesnt matter because it is a tube so i am always covered  i have been using nightly since i got it 6 months agowwwamazoncomdpb07rjqgv61this one by cyraneme is a close second though comfort quality adjustability and the fact that it can actually fit large heads are all positives in my opinion the rotation and the indents and hair snag is variable depends on if i can find that sweet spot for fit i definitely have tried other sleep masks that i never used ever again this i will use it is still at my bed side,human
after using this product daily for a month i didnt notice any significant results it also makes your face look oily which i find unappealing,ai

the arlo cameras i purchased about 3 years ago are notorious for consuming battery life ive purchased many different brands of batteries since becoming an owner of arlo cameras and the energizer cr123a have had the absolute worst performance in a pack of 50 not one set lasted more than 6 days range 36 days compare this to disposable tenergy batteries which consistently lasted an average of 25 months and titanium batteries which lasted an average of 7 weeks ive also purchased a number of brands of rechargeable batteries which last anywhere from 4 days to 2 weeks before requiring a recharge this may have been just this particular package but im unlikely to try energizer again,human

these are pretty good pillboxes the lids are really secure and they have a decent amount of space they work great but theres one problem once you put the pills in them the only way to get them back out is to completely dump the box upside down i have skinny fingers and i still cant get them out and of course dumping it means that i drop pills more times than not its a design flaw for sure but the product still does a great job otherwise,human

re the orange permanent deafmaker ear plugs aka lets go to the er at 5am plugs i put the orange plugs in and went to sleepat 4am i woke up with pain in my left ear i remove the right plug and try to remove the left plug but the clear plastic nib comes out and leaves the plug in my earfor the next hour i try to pull the plug out but i cant its painful and im worried i need to go to an emergency room without the clear plastic nib its impossible to grab onto i try tweezers but i cant get a gripat 5am i wake up my neighbor and ask them for help he tries the tweezers but it doesnt work we decide to gently insert a wooden toothpick into the hole where the clear plastic nib used to be and after about 30 minutes of very careful jiggling we get it outi crymy neighbor consoles me we go to bed i cant sleep my adrenaline has been activated i normally wake up at 9am so i lost 5 hours of sleep that nightthis is dangerous and should never be sold to consumers re the gummy silicone earplugs these are the most usable but they worry me they arent effective unless the gummy part extends into the ear canal which youre not supposed to do based on the directions but if you do this it forms a vacuum seal and does pretty good at keeping sound outthe issue is that if you so much as tap your ear youll feel it on your ear drums because of the seal you have to be very very very careful when you pull these out or youll rupture your eardrumsif you put them in like youre supposed to just covering the outside of the ear canal they let almost all of the sound in still they cant be used safely in my opinion and i recommend not using them in an unsafe way just to get them to work i was desperate and so i did it the unsafe way but dont do what i did re the other earplugs the grey bombshaped ear plugs were not effective at all for me they sat in my ear and let all the sound in still they have clear plastic fins on them to pull them out and although mine didnt break like the orange earplugs did i would still be afraid of them being a safety hazard if they did breakthe blue christmastree shaped earplugs seem the safest they are all one piece of rubber and so it seems like a very low risk of breaking and you can safely insert them and they seem to work the only issue is theyre not really meant to block sound so much as reduce volume so i can still hear snoring construction work etc plus they have a long piece that sticks out and prevents you from putting your ears on your pillow comfortably if you sleep on your back or you dont use them for sleeping they would be fine id recommend this pair to you if you just need to reduce noise and not block it out completely and dont sleep on your side quick summary except for the blue christmas tree shaped earplugs i would recommend you just throw these ear plugs in the trash so you dont hurt yourself,human
i inserted the orange earplugs and went to sleep at 4am i woke up with intense pain in my left ear while trying to remove the plugs the clear plastic nib detached from the left plug and stayed stuck in my ear leaving me unable to remove it for an hour i tried unsuccessfully to get the plug out causing a great deal of pain and concern about needing emergency assistance the absence of the clear nib made it impossible to grip the plug and tweezers didnt help at 5am i asked my neighbor for help after trying tweezers we resorted to gently using a wooden toothpick to carefully extract the plug over the course of 30 minutes after the ordeal i felt exhausted having lost five hours of sleep this product is dangerous and should not be sold,ai

this product was priced very well but isnt top quality that being said what you do get is a nice cheap way to incorporate cupping into your massage practice you get quite a bit in size options so thats very helpful and they do maintain good suction the only thing i dont like is that over time the plastic cups show signs of being brittle and some have cracked they did last me quite a while for being so cheap so i cant complain i wasnt looking for a big investment so for the price it was worth it to me and i use it as my practice set i did enjoy the cupping procedure and the pump handle really lets you control the strength of the suction quite well so if youd like to try out cupping but dont want to invest in an expensive kit this one is the one for you the cupping technique has helped me with my shoulder pain as it really breaks up adhesions and gives more blood flow to the area i place the cup on a sore spot and suction the skin about half way up the cup and let it stay for a few minutes like that another technique is to put massage oil on the area of your skin first then suction it a little less than half way and then slide the cup around youtube has some great tutorials,human
this set is a great budgetfriendly option if youre looking to try cupping without a major investment it offers a variety of size options and maintains good suction over time however the plastic cups show signs of brittleness and some have cracked despite this the cups lasted well for their price and the pump handle allows for good control over suction strength if youre just starting with cupping and dont want to splurge this set is a great choice ive found cupping helpful for my shoulder pain as it improves blood flow and breaks up adhesions,ai

let me just start from the beginning first the packaging for this is super cute and totally is what drew me to this energy supplement the packaging draws you in and the name itself totally makes you want to see what this is then you read cherry bomb and i was totally intrigued and it sounds like it would be an awesome flavor this stuff ticked all my boxes on looks and drawing me inhowever when i opened it and smelled what was in this nope nope oh heck to the nope nope i have to be completely honest i cant even tell you what it smelled like because its not something ive ever smelled yeah tells you exactly what it is huh i know its driving me crazy too because its this strong striking scent that you think you know but then when you think about it you really have no idea then i tried it worst mistake ever its like battery acid meets stomach bile except id rather drink that the worst part is while i was very hesitant to even try this after smelling it i was like ive tried things that smelled horrible tried it and honestly it was awesome however me being dumb and super thirsty i ended up downing half a bottle before wanting to rip my tongue out its messed up because it started out totally fine until you stop drinking and then the smell turns into the taste my tongue is still mad at me and i dont blame it i still have remnants of the smell and then it reminds me of the taste and i spit up a bit yeah its gross its more than gross seriously dont buy this stuff and being someone that drinks zero sugar drinks and sugarfree stuff its not this being sugarfreeon another note i wish everything came with the little scoops that glytch uses its a scoop and funnel in one and is totally genius so at least i got a super awesome scoop out of this horrid stuff,human

ill start by saying that the pair of jade facial tools i received do indeed match the online product photos the gua sha scraper is a significantly darker shade of green than the lighter bright green hue of the accompanying roller im not sure why anyone would intentionally choose a set of paired tools that differ so drastically in color but at least theyve been accurately represented in the listingwhile the scraper is smoothly polished and comfortable to use and hold the dualended roller is rather noisy unlike most other jade rollers currently available this roller doesnt have the clear silicone plugs present inside each drilled cylinder so all rolling motions produce a clunking sound as the stones bump up against the metal bars of the triangleshaped hardware the stones are nicely polished and attractive otherwise and each end of the roller still provides adequate pressure but the overall functionality leaves a little to be desired since a silent rolling mechanism hasnt been ensuredat a current list price of 495 this is by far the cheapest jade facial set ive come across so it might be great for new users who are looking to test drive a pair of these tools before possibly selecting a slightly more expensive version but the visual impact of the widely different color shades is definitely distracting,human
the jade facial tools i received match the online photos but the scraper and roller are significantly different in color the scraper is polished and comfortable to use but the roller is noisy because it lacks silicone plugs inside the cylinders it still provides adequate pressure but the clunking sound is distracting at this price point its a good option for someone new to these tools but the color mismatch is a bit offputting,ai

when i had surgery a few months ago i was unable to put my pillows over my head as id grown accustomed to doing i have a cpap machine with nose cushion mask and i used the pillows to hold that in place while blocking the light overnight but that surgery meant i couldnt use the pillows  i had to sleep on my back and propped a bit for two months so i got a night mask and have slept all the better ever since when my wife saw the difference in me she started to sleep with a mask as well  the darker night has made sleep deeper and more recuperativewe each have a mask we love the same gotten on amazon but we wanted a back up for her so she could wash that one from time to time i saw this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade and decided to give it a try ill admit  she thought i was off base with the wrap around design  it would not fit or it would be too hot or but she gave it a try she loves it1 this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade wraps around the full head i have a larger head wearing a lgxl baseball hat she does not  hers is much smaller this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade fits both of our heads comfortably2 i have not slept in this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade but i did try it on with my cpap nose cushion mask  it does not sit right i can get it closed and all the way around my head but i use it and the purpose is so as to block out all light with the cpap on there is a large gap at the base of the mask where it goes over the nose piece unlike other masks i have i cannot recommend this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade for someone with this type of cpap3 the materials are excellent this is a soft and luxurious wrap that feels cool and soft making for a very comfortable experience my wife did end up taking it off about halfway through the night feeling it heated her head too much to be fair she has the same issue with pillows but not with masks that have only the eyes covered with a strap around i had it on only for a brief time i felt i could go longer than my wife but again needing the cpap i am unable to use it4 what we both like is that there is a softening of sound with it on we use a sound machine to keep nighttime sounds drowned out but this adds to that  my wife really felt it helped her sleep a little more blocking out additional sound5 the velcro is easy onoff and it is well attached to the wrap keeping one from worrying itll detach  its secure6 looks nice for the ladies this has a nice feminine look  my wife says soas of this writing my wife loves it  as do i though it doesnt allow me to use it  and will use it often she does take it off it gets hot  but thats something that she feels is a personal thing in the end shes happy to have it and happy to recommend this luxury silk sleep mask  tara sartoria artisan handmade mask,human

these are nice for using on your face but they do not hold enough soap to clean larger parts of the body the two pads measure 3 x 25 and have soft silicone bristles that felt great on my face you squirt a little liquid soap on these and rub it on a wet face and the soap suds up nicely and cleans well the only problem is that soap can get on the other side and make the pad slippery to hold i just grasp the knob between two fingers rather than sticking my fingers in the pocket and then i can keep a pretty good gripthere is also a scrubber that has a sponge inside you can squirt soap on the sunny face then squeeze the sponge to create a fine white foam from the soap these bristles are a little bit firmer than the pads but they are still very nice feeling on the face the reverse side has thicker stiffer silicone bristles the sponge is pretty easy to squeeze and pull out of the hole it dries quickly when removed the scrubber is a nice size to easily hold and squeeze while using it is 2 inches tall by 2 inches wide,human
these pads are ideal for facial use though they dont hold enough soap to clean larger body parts the 3 x 25 size with soft silicone bristles is excellent for facial use creating a nice lather the only issue is that soap can seep onto the back making the pad slippery i hold it by the knob for a better grip the scrubber with a sponge inside also works well though the bristles are a bit firmer its easy to squeeze and dries quickly and the scrubber is a perfect size for use,ai

frankly we like this product it does not leak all the soap out as the 3m product did and it cleans the dishes just fine the problem is that the sponge head comes loose from the plastic base that holds it on the handle the first one came off in about a week or so and now the second one has done the same the seller is willing to send me a new set and have me return the old set but unfortunately the ups store here is not a regular store and i would need to go 90 miles to a fullservice ups store i will see what alternatives the seller and amazon offer frankly this is a bummer since the product is head and shoulders better than our previous 3m ones if only it would stay glued together,human

this is the only form of iodine that i can take  not only that years ago i was treated for lyme disease  my heavy metals were tested and my lead and mercury were off the chart  while at an amazing clinic i was also treated with chelation therapy to reduce my heavy metals  by the time i left my lead and mercury were about 12 of what they had been but were still way too high  i came home bought an iv pkg from a local dr but they made me wait 4 months before i could start chelation therapy again  during that time i was taking 57 of these a day to help with my energy  i had read that this can remove heavy metals but how effectively  when the dr finally had time to see me 4 months later and they tested me for heavy metals they were all but gone  this stuff had pulled the rest of them out of my system  the 1000 i paid just had to be used for the occasional vitamin c iv because no one ever refunds money  now the thing about heavy metals is that they can get into every cell so you clean out the blood and other stores will be released  meaning it might take years and years to completely remove all of the heavy metals depending upon how long you had mercury in your mouth how much or how long you were exposed to other things if you are using it for anything other than as an iodine source you might want to have your heavy metals tested to check your progress  i have not had my heavy metals tested in years but this product helps to give me energy and helps me to feel good so i continue to take 35 per day  they are staples in my ever shrinking supplement list,human

latest update jan 2018 after 23 years of trying to keep the little feet on the scale from leaving black streaks on the bathroom floor i gave up and threw this scale away  cleaning the feet did not work coating the feet with clear nail polish worked only for a time attaching felt covers on the feet also only worked temporarily  amazing  so relieved to be rid of the bloody thingupdate i removed one star after using this scale for about a year now  the scale rests on little square rubber feet and these little bits of rubber leave black streaks on my tiled bathroom floor every single time i move the scale on the floor  its like the rubber feet are made of soot  i tried cleaning them but no amount of cleaning prevents the feet from leaving black streaks  i finally painted over the feet with clear nail polish top coat  that worked for a while but the top coat apparently wears off after a while  ive had to repaint the rubber feet after a few months  awfulthis is the best bathroom scale i have owned  ever  it is sleek in design easy to read with the bright bluelit background  most importantly it is accurate  my old scale used to give a differenr reading each time i got on it even if it was seconds apart  also this scale uses regular  batteries instead of the hardtofind led batteries the old scale used  i have only had this scale for about 2 weeks but i am really glad  i made the switch  if you are looking for an easytoread accurate scale i recommend this one,human

these gloves work really well and they are an extremely timesaving efficient means to dust both mini blinds and knickknacksthis product is a pair of gloves and i wear both at the same time one on each hand to dust a handy plus is that once one side of the gloves gets too dusty you can switch the gloves to opposite hands in order to reverse the gloves so that you are dusting with a clean side in order to continue dusting and get twice as much use out of the gloves before washing themyou can throw these gloves into the washer on cold gentle cycle but you need to air dry them i have so far washed them by hand in order to make them last longerhighly recommended,human

compared to other products like this ive read many reviews and compared many products i havent fully tested and used this product yet but i have high hopes in that it will help i have a few weeks before i can really test how well this works in addition to other detox methods and changes in my diet and exercise routines i took a chance on this product and hopefully it will helpupdate 1013i wanted this product to work in fact i got the second bottle for free and took the pills for 2 weeks straight so i had really high hopes that it would work i just tested myself before my real test tomorrow and my results are positive after having not smoked for over 2 weeks and then using these pills for the last 2 weeks straight the bottle claims to work within a week and it hasnt worked for me for 2 weeks of use just disappointed that i wasted my time and money taking 6 pills a day for 2 weeks guess im going with my last resort which was an additional detox drink before my real test hopefully that will work dont bother with this if it doesnt work for me in 2 weeks i cant understand how some people got results in 1 such a let down,human

these are very nice essential oil rollons you get a total of 4 different blends in this little relaxation kits the tranquility  blend is a mix of vetiver cedarwood and chamomile it is a very nice woodsy aroma that smells great the piece out blend is a mi of lavender orange and bergamot probably my favorite it is a beautiful blend that is just perfect to apply before you head to bed tension is a blend that contains peppermint and wintergreen and to be honest i am not a huge fan to that one mostly because i am rather sensitive to mind ache is the last one and contains arnica and frankincense to help with inflammation bruising and sprains that one smells a bit rougher but it is supposed to help with inflammation and does seem to help maybe a little bitthat one is applied directly to the affected area while tension is applied best to the temples since it helps with headaches a little bit the other two can be applied to the temples or pulse points to distribute their effects these are easy to apply and use their scents are pretty mild and sadly do fade fairly quickly all considering i like that they come in these easy little applicator rollons that are easy to bring along really all in all nice little set that also makes for a good gift,human

this supplement has a lot of very good ingredients the dosage per day is two pills they dont have a horrible smell butthese are so big  i have trouble swallowing pills at all and the big ones are a struggle if they even go downi looked at the ingredients list everything is good but honestly id buy this supplement if they just put the bottom half of the list in them the top half can be had in so many multi vitamins that already exist no need to duplicate those when it is the bottom of the list id be interested in the most the subsequent pill could then be smaller as welloverall not bad but not worth it for a onemonth supply that mostly duplicates a decent multivitamin,human
while this supplement contains highquality ingredients the pills are huge and difficult for me to swallow id prefer a smaller pill with the same effective ingredients overall its a good product but the pill size makes it hard to recommend for daily use,ai

i originally gave this a 3 star review because i thought it was too heavy  and i ordered a buckwheat  rice wrap  although this is heavier than the other one  the reality is that compariatively they are very close i guess when shoulders are sore they are more sensitive  i find myself reaching for this one because of the capelike design  it distributes the heat where i need it  im giving it 5 stars although if there was a 45 option id probably pick that  i wish there was a way to have the contents shift around less maybe some internal sections if that would work with also needing to shift the beads around when nuking them to distribute the heat  not sure if the physics of that but if a couple strategically placed compartments were possible that would improve this  i think the fill to internal space ratio is very good so dont add more beads i like to nap with this and dont like to nap with the buckwheat one because it is too thick and wont flatten outbelow is original for referencevery very heavy  this is much heavier than i realized even though i read the other comments  its really too heavy for me  im going to keep it as it is as advertised at least i think so i didnt think it held heat as long as they said but i only nuked it for the 1 minute  i will use it sometimes but will need to be careful with it and only use it for short period of time because of the amount of compression the weight puts on my shoulder  im using it because of an issue in an arm that is affecting shoulders and i want my lymph fluid to flow freely  i am going to need to purchase something else lighter  maybe the buckwheat filled warmer like i was originally looking for,human
initially i thought this was too heavy but after trying it i found the weight is quite comparable to similar products the capelike design really helps distribute the heat where i need it ive upgraded my review to 5 stars though id prefer if the contents shifted around less which could potentially be solved with internal sections,ai

the mountain falls ultra sunscreen is a very affordable alternative to the big name brand sunscreens the first thing i noticed about this sunscreen is that the scent is pretty mild it does have the typical smell that goes along with products containing sunscreen but its not very strong at all in fact its barely noticeable when you first open the lid of it it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and doesnt leave any greasiness behind it seems to do a good job of protecting as long as you remember to reapply it regularly  every year i cringe at the prices of sunscreen out there this is a noncringe worthy comparable product,human
the mountain falls ultra sunscreen is a great affordable alternative to pricier brands it absorbs quickly isnt greasy and provides solid protection when reapplied regularly overall its a reliable budgetfriendly sunscreen,ai

there are 12 individually wrapped smal bath bombs in this set the fragrances are orange lavender frankincense rosemary mint lemongrass vanilla seasalt kiwi rose coconut and papayai tried the papaya when it was first plunged into the water see video there was fizz and no suds before i could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later see photo also the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the packagesince i personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath i used this in a foot bath the water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bathin summary these bombs perform terribly are staining and are barely fragrant in the bath the current price of 1999 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to 167 per bath bomb which is about what i would expect to pay for bombs of this size however at that price i also expect these to perform and they do not these are super lackluster and an utter disappointment i am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars i doubt the other reviewers even tried this in the bath in the box they look impressive but if they had used at least one they most likely would not be so impressed,human
this set includes 12 individually wrapped bath bombs with various fragrances such as orange lavender frankincense rosemary mint lemongrass vanilla seasalt kiwi rose coconut and papaya i tried the papaya scent upon dropping it in the water it fizzed out quickly without any noticeable suds and the fragrance was barely detectable despite smelling nice in the package the color stained my skin and towels but didnt affect the foot bath itself these bombs underperformed and at 1999 theyre not worth the price,ai
i got some of this at an online naturalorganic foods shop and unlike every other kind of untraditional noodle i have ever cooked my husband and son both ate this and liked it i had made pasta with garlic and cheese for me and they ate my snackits good the noodles are thin and the texture is nice they taste good and they take the flavor of the sauce you use but they dont become the flavor of the sauce the way say shiritaki noodles dofour servings to a bag and when they cook up theres a lot tons of fiber in these as well 11gserving i think,human
i purchased these noodles online and was pleasantly surprised when my husband and son liked them even though they are used to more traditional pasta the noodles have a thin texture absorb the sauce well and dont take on its flavor as much as other noodles like shiritaki each bag contains four servings and they are high in fiber making them a good option for a healthy meal,ai

i like the style of kf94 masks they fit my face the best and are comfortable for me to wear all day if necessary these masks are made in china they are individually wrapped in plastic bags which i prefer i keep backup masks in my car and bag and this way i know the masks are clean until i need to use onethese masks have smaller ear loops than other kf94 masks i have used for me the smaller ear loops are good  i have a petite face and the small ear loops help me get a tight fit over my cheeks and chin if you have a larger face the small ear loops might not be a positivethe masks have the expected nose clip but above the nose clip the masks have a vshaped cutout in theory the vshaped cutout should help the top of the mask fit better against the sides of your nose since its not a straight line like most masks but for me the sides of the cutout stand away from my nose so theyre right at the bottom of my view and i worry they are a spot for air to slide in and out of the mask since they arent tight against my face,human
i appreciate the kf94 masks for their comfortable fit especially since they suit my petite face well the ear loops are smaller than most which helps achieve a snug fit however the vshaped cutout at the top of the mask doesnt work as intended for me as it creates gaps on the sides allowing air to enter overall these masks are good for my needs but might not be ideal for larger faces,ai

i first learned of dmso from our teenage sons college running coach  as an athlete who runs over 100 miles a week our kid was frequently dealing with pains and injuries from his workouts  when knee or ankle pain didnt ease up after a few days and serious injury had been ruled out by orthopedists the trainers would break out the dmsosince then ive used it on my own runninginjured knee occasionally when the pain becomes too bad  after applying the area remains wet and a bit sticky for about 2030 minutes remember to wash your hands thoroughly after rubbing it in  after this amount of time you can wipe off any excess that hasnt been absorbed by your body  during this time the area usually becomes warm a bit rosy and itchy  i also get a garlic taste in my mouth which is typical for most people  for those people who use it frequently their bodies can begin to emit a garliclike odor in their sweatdmso is a byproduct of paper making and is primarily used as an industrial solvent for herbicides fungicides antibiotics and plant hormones  its had experimental use orally as treatment for certain types of cancer  at this time it does not have the approval of the fda for use on humans other than as a specific physicianprescribed treatment for bladder disordercancer  it is fda approved for use on horses and dogs and is widely used in that industryits important to note that the face and neck are more sensitive to dmso and no higher concentrations than 50 should ever be applied there  also when applying dmso to your skin its important that the skin is totally clean dry and unbroken because dmso penetrates the body  as it penetrates dmso can carry any chemical that has a molecular weight of up to 1000 units right through the skin and into the body into the blood stream and even through the bloodbrain barrier it also leaves the skin more permeable than normal for a few hours there is a possibility that chemicals such as the dye from clothing in contact with dmsotreated skin could be accidentally passed through the skin and carried directly into the bodywhile i do generally experience pain relief when i use dmso i usually save it for when my knee is at its worst,human
i was introduced to dmso through my sons running coach who uses it for muscle pain i now use it occasionally for knee pain after applying it leaves a sticky residue for 2030 minutes and the area becomes warm and itchy some users report a garliclike taste in their mouth and frequent use can lead to a garlic scent in your sweat while i find it effective for pain relief its important to apply it properly and with caution as it can penetrate the skin and carry chemicals into the body,ai

really are they kidding us okay i had to admit that i got taken by the commercial i never get taken well hardly ever captain corcoran liked to say by these things but i also have lots of quotscuff marksquot around the house on walls doors railings etc plus oven gunk that needs to be cleaned off its that second part that really made me try this since it talked about how great this works on stove tops and ovens yeah right the quoteraserquot is a flimsy spongelike material that does nothing and unlike even the cheapest sponge it does not hold up to even the most gentle rubbing on any surface you are supposed to wet it and then rub it on the stain or dirt or gunk however if you try that even on a slick wall it falls apart in your hands its like trying to clean your cars exterior with kleenex and even if you can rub it over a surface gently and keep it in one piece it has absolutely no ability to clean none you would do better to spit on your fingers and rub them on the surface and at least your fingers dont disintegrate and you dont have to feel really stupid to have fallen for this con by quotmr cleanquot and thrown money down the drain by the way never let this go down the drain since it clogs it i used to love the mr clean commercials as a little boy and had a neighbor who looked just like the bold mascot so when id go to the supermarket with my mom i always told her she should buy dome but my mom always laughed and told me that the product itself was totally useless yes everyone always listen to your mother stay away from this money wasting useless crap,human

i always sleep with a mask and ive had so many different stylesbrands this is by far the most comfortable mask ive ever used its soft and lightly padded which feels good on my eyes and it has a little material that blocks out 100 of the light if its adjusted right the best thing is the little metal buckle to adjust the strap isnt right behind my ear which most masks it is and it hurts when i sleep on my side this one is pain free and perfect im tempted to order a couple more as backup for the day when i wear this one out,human

due to health concerns i need to ensure im getting enough protein and this product has been a fantastic addition ive made a frozen mixture that i keep on hand and it boosts both the protein content and the flavor its now one of my favorites,ai
i like this twixflavored protein  the collagen powder in this protein product really does help with the granularity but it does mean that a blender rather than a fork or spoon is your mixing tool of choice  its very smooth when made and it has a good enough flavor on its own that you wont need to supplement your supplement drink with anything but like most chocolate products a little banana or peanut butter goes a long way towards making this more of a shake and less of a drinkno matter how you like it though i think youll find its good,human
im really enjoying the twixflavored protein the collagen powder adds a smooth texture though youll need a blender for best results the flavor is satisfying on its own but adding a bit of banana or peanut butter can make it feel more like a milkshake either way i think youll find it delicious,ai

i am a certified aromatherapist and i really enjoy exposing these companies that are selling fraudulent essential oils  first of all the price should give it away sandalwood is endangered now and in many countries you are strictly limited on harvest hence why its so priceythe smell is hideous to me it also failed the oil blot test i use to check essential oils from unknown brands  the danger in using these oils is that because they are not sandalwood you cant possible get the therapeutic benefits you would expect  many companies and now taking cheaper essential oils and combining them to smell like something else others are just using chemicals i dont know which category this falls into but it is not sandalwood essential oilwalk away,human

so far this is not working very well for me  the wrap itself appears well made is easy to put on and comfortable  the instructions are awful and it takes a bit of time to figure out how to use it  apparently the manufacturerdistributor is aware of this and sent me an email informing me if it didnt work they would replace it  so the question is what is it supposed to do  using the 34red34 setting for intensity and time and waiting for 15 minutes to warm up i could barely feel any heat only slight warmth not very therapeutic over the course of 30 minutes or so  maybe for the price thats about all one should expect  ill be shopping for a better one4118 update  after periodic use of the wrap i am changing my rating from two stars to four stars because after use i discovered the heat is adequate although it could be a little hotter  the major problem as noted by others is the control  it remains unclear how to keep the wrap in the warmest red mode and as another reviewer noted you have to keep checking to make sure it hasnt switched to cooler white or blue modes  i suspect there may be a way to eliminate this problem but with such poor documentation it is impossible so far to keep it working correctly  in summary this is a nice well made wrap that attaches to the knee well  if the cord was longer and the controls worked better this could be a very good wrap for applying heat to the knees4818 update  after continued use i am changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars  i have found that when tightly wrapped which is easy to do because of the softness flexibility and large velcro attachments using the red setting hottest it heats to a very comfortable temperature the setting controls could be improved or maybe better instructions should have been provided  this is what i am now doing  after pressing the large plastic square control button for a second or two colortemp is selected i press it when it lights red this is the hottest setting it also has two lower oneswhite and blue  after a few minutes the setting changes to a cooler white or blue color  i then repress the red and it stays at this settingtemp until i turn it off  it really works well provides a very comfortable warm pleasant temp and fits very well over the kneearea,human
so far this wrap isnt working well for me its comfortable and wellmade but the instructions are confusing and i barely feel any heat after using it for 30 minutes im going to look for a better one after continued use ive adjusted my rating ive figured out how to use it more effectively and it provides a comfortable soothing heat now,ai

since we installed provenza oil finished floors i wanted to ensure that they were maintained the way the manufacture recommended i use this product because that is what the manufacture recommends but it is extremely pricy in my book  the product separates quite a bit and yes i know you are supposed to shake it but at times i wish i had one of those paint can shaker machines to shake the product up  i get a good workout with all the shaking required  id like to find an alternative to the product,human

these were the first led lamps ive ever purchasedwe have a ceiling fan in our family room and for some reason both filament bulbs and cfls were burning out quickly within 3 months in one of the four sockets this despite the fact that we dont use the fan all that much also this particular fixture gets a lot of use in our home the lights not the fan so if i could save energy on lighting this application struck me as an opportunity to achieve the greatest payback on the investmentthese bulbs have a small footprint not much bigger than a normal incandescent lamp this was important because they had to fit inside the diffuser globes like most led lamps they send most of the light out the top in a ceiling fixture with four sockets this behavior is not at all objectionable but might be a problem with a reading lamp or other singlebulb fixturethe four bulbs draw a lot less power yet throw noticeably more light than cfls with the same lumen rating in fact im getting a lot more light from these lamps than i expected toall led lamps are currently a little pricey but these are a good deal for what they are and they have held up well so far im very happy with them as long as they continue to function they should pay for themselves in a couple of yearsupdate feb 2014  in the last 8 months ive had no problems with these led lamps burning out ive never had that level of success with either filament lamps or with cfls in this ceiling fan fixture just the fact that i dont have to get out a 6foot step ladder every two months has me very happy with this product,human
these are the first led bulbs ive bought and theyre a great investment they fit perfectly in the ceiling fan sockets and give off more light while using less power than cfls the small size fits well in the diffuser globes although led bulbs are a bit expensive these have been reliable and im happy with them they should pay for themselves in a couple of years,ai

these are nice makeup removal pads you get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution and of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads these makeup pads are very nice and work well the removal solution is very gentle probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredientsthey smell very good and i found are gentle enough to use around the eyes i had no issues removing foundation lipsticks are eye makeup all in all i am very happy with these the price is rather reasonable too at 12 for 70 of these pads i think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant but since these are gentle enough to use around the eyes they should be good for sensitive skin,human

i really like the saturix 11x16 prep  spill pads as they lay on a surface very flat i have tried household basics like paper towels cotton shop towels and brown paper rolls but they all have a flaw that makes then difficult to use when i am working with products like prepping a model for a very clean mold i cannot introduce lint as i would with cotton towels i have to be aware of chemical compatibilities and paper towels usually contain clay for extra absorbancy and make dust brown paper slides on the surface and does not always help with all spills i felt like i had to choose the lesser of evils these pads are exactly what i have been looking for but simply did not know what they were called i like the  polyethylene backing which can hold up against mild solvents like isopropyl alcohol i appreciate the company also features domestic contact information on the package this is a good sign that customer service for questions and issues are more likely to be addressed i hope my experience is helpful as you kindly will click the button below,human

vegetable glycerin used in food applications is usp grade or over 99 pure and has a sweet taste vegetable glycerin metabolizes differently than sugar and is used in low carbohydrate foods for sweetness and moisture unlike sugar glycerin does not contribute to tooth decaymany household products including lotions shampoo and toothpaste contain vegetable glycerin glycerin is added to these products because it is a humectant a substance that attracts moisture to the skin in the cosmetic world this has two practical applications first glycerin leaves your skin hydrated glycerin soap for example is popular for that very reason second for cosmetic products that deliver an active ingredient a humectant can increase the solubility of the active ingredient making it more easily absorbed by the skini personally use this glycerin to make my own soap i love iti also love the price i will be buying again and again,human

i heard of sea moss awhile ago and been searching for them in supermarket but no luck at all therefore i turned to amazon and surprisingly this particular brand has many 5 star reviews so i went ahead and bought thisit look genuine and promising from the packaging upon opening the bag i found bits and pieces of things that were confusing at first that was only a tiny bit of the sea moss i took out from the bagi did a little research and read all of the question and answers on the amazon page regarding this product the seller mentioned that this sea moss originate from indonesia previous edited from philippinesthe colorful threads and strings are plastic it is not surprising at all if these sea moss were farmed near textile factories these very thin plastic threads are made from melting of plastic and making them into fine threads and then into clothing the finer transparent plastic threads clings to the sea moss for their life it is almost impossible to get rid of every single piece you will see what i mean if you soak italso on the packaging itself located on the back states  34cal prop 65 warning34 this product contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harmthis indication is not pointing to sea moss causing cancer but the substance that is in the sea moss that comes from waste and heavily polluted areas i have am pointing out what is clearly stated i love sea moss but this particular brand contains dangerous chemicals that causes cancer it horrifies me even further because indonesia is no where near safe from the fukushima spill all of the area of the pacific ocean contain high level of radiation due to the spill sea plants are highly sensitive and will absorb these radiation thats why sea food from the pacific ocean are much cheaper compare to the atlanticas always do your research and watch out better safe than sorry,human

using hemp products is a bit of a crap shoot because youre never quite sure if the product is going to have any effect on your condition  so im giving a cautious thumbs up for this because ive been using it with great success on an inflamed muscle in my leg  i didnt expect it to work this well i tried it because when i test a product i put it through all sorts of paceswhat i found was that within about 5 minutes of application the pain in my leg and backside had eased considerably  it didnt go away entirely that required the addition of some nsaids but it did make the discomfort manageable which is a blessing  when i tried this as a sleep aid it did nothing for me  results on a headache were mixed  i will say that some advice i was given  always look for hemp products that are co2 extracted  was good advice because i find such products to be acrosstheboards more effective than any otherswhat can i take away from these experiments mostly what i take from most such experiments we are all different and products like this which are created without set standards will inevitably vary so if this works for you for some conditions be glad use it you lucked out  if it doesnt hand it off to someone else who might have better luck and try something else,human

i had previously left a 3 star review since i was able to get a smooth shave the first time i used it ive always had trouble shaving intimate areas because of razor burn and ingrown hairs i was very hesitant in purchasing this product because ive tried countless shavers epilators razors you name it  ive probably tried iti used this product one time and it was pretty cool that you use it wet so i decided to try it out in the bathtub it shaved very well even though it was rather difficult reaching some places now the aloe strips helped tremendously and i was quite pleased with the results however after using this one time the aloe strips were ruined and i couldnt use the shaver again because it caused horrible razor burn and didnt get nearly as close of a shave as before there also isnt an option to purchase more aloe strips without having to buy a whole replacement head i contacted customer service and sent pictures of the aloe strips and explained the situation long story short they offered half my money back so id be stuck with a shaver i cant use and half of a refund  no thank you i ended up returning the item dont waste your money on one good shave,human

i have 3 verilux lamps including this one so that i can use them at my piano reading chair and at bedside  these are sturdy lamps with a nice clean design and a variety of colors to compliment any decor my favorite is the ivory  i have presbyopia and early cataracts so can benefit greatly from higher contrast in reading and needlework these lamps are beyond meeting my expectations  whereas i used to have a lot of eye fatigue and got sleepy while reading at night this is no longer the case the black print appears darker sharper as if id upgraded my glass prescription i find that i have sufficient spread of light for reading an average newspaper page even the newspaper stock quote pages are now readable whereas this isnt the case otherwise  i also do a lot of watercolor painting and needlepoint it is a treat to be able to work into the evening while being confident that my color mixes are true  here is an amusing side note which supports that the light approximates daylightmy elderly cat who enjoys a daily bath in outdoor sunlight sometimes substitutes the verilux lamp light for his spa when the weather is bad it cant be the heat that he is drawn to as little is given off  i can appreciate some reviewers observations that the quality of the light is perhaps overly white yet the lamp is not intended for ambient lighting but rather for a small task area  the light bulbs are not pricey when you consider that they last for 5 years and are thus an average cost of 4 a year also they use less than 15 of the electricity of a traditional 150 watt reading light  if making a decision to purchase this lamp i would suggest that you base it upon your need or wish to have better clarity in visual work at night it is not intended to add daylight to a room  there are many cheaper verilux lookalikes but i wouldnt recommend these there are serious complaintsthat these fall apart in a year or two or fail to work from the beginning,human
these sturdy lamps with clean designs are ideal for focused lighting great for reading crafting and even painting the high contrast significantly reduces eye strain,ai

easy to assemble and perfect for gifting versatile enough for party favors or special events,ai
these containers are very similar to glad or ziploc products  while they are reusable they definitely feel like the kind of product that ends up being thrown away after a few uses  if you want to decrease your plastic use or help the environment glass bento type boxes are probably the way to go  that said these are very convenient  they have two separate sections for food  they seal well  i did have some issues with the lids warping in the dishwasher  overall for the price a decent productif you found my review helpful please click yes below  thank you,human
convenient but not very durable warping issues in the dishwasher make them less reusable than glass alternatives,ai
the cat was interested in this toy for maybe 510 minutes then it was batted under the couch never to be seen againthe problem is that it shuts off almost immediately when stationary it would be better to have a 1 minute cutoff at least keeping the cats attention a bit longercat says meh,human
my cat lost interest quickly because the toy shuts off almost immediately when still extending the cutoff time could help keep their attention longer,ai
construction quality materials similar to most of the other lipo bags available  purchase for part of the storage setup of some 3s lipos  more or less just one added layer of protection against a lipo incident  during charging continuous monitoring of the lipo internal temp external temp charging rateslevels smell sight is more important than the bag in preventing an ugly situationif you experience a real catastrophic lipo event this bag might give you enough time to grab whatever fire suppression device you have to deal with the situation the bag is a bit like airbags and seatbelts in a vehicle  hope you never have to rely on device  but in the event a bad situation occurs the bag may be the difference between a major or minor loss  personally i wouldnt store charge or use  questionable lipos  dispose properly and invest in a replacement,human
this lipo bag provides an added layer of safety for storage and charging however its not a substitute for proper lipo monitoring practices,ai
was a little big and everyone laughed but i could fit everything in this thing and it would sit on my back side so it didnt get in the way for me  the only reason why i had to give it up was because my instructor said that if i wore this at clinicals i would spread germs from room to room without knowing it  i guess it very well could have however my shoes dont spread germs  my clothes  i had to stop wearing it but i save it for when i am done and a hospital lets me wear it  i can even put my stethoscope in it,human

i just moved back to an area where im close to an old and very dear friend that i kept in touch with for all the years i lived far away so now that im near i wanted to give her something that she would enjoy and i know how much she enjoys a long leisurely bath  a nobrainer to get bath bombs then  this is a beautiful set that i know she will be happy to receive and thrilled to use once she can lock the bathroom door kidsthey always want to bother mom when shes trying to get a little me time and relax for a time  i love these  for her and others  but i cant take baths any longer as i have health issues that make it difficult for me to get out of the bathtub from that position  i dont envy those who can take a bath  i know my friend will enjoy the bath bombs just as i would if i could,human
this bath bomb set was the perfect gift for my friend who loves a relaxing soak the quality is great and she was thrilled to receive it,ai
its good in theory but hanging the arms is kind of inconvenient and the rotating shiatsu balls hurt in certain positions especially when they hit my spine it hurt enough that i returned it,human
while the concept is good the product is inconvenient to use and the shiatsu balls can be painful in certain positions i ended up returning it,ai

easy to use smells wonderful and allnatural i adore method products,ai
ive had it for just about 2 days thank you for getting it to me days before the initial delivery date i like everything about this chair so far save for 2 items the beeping every time you press a button honestly it is obnoxious and im on the hunt to disable it the turning radius is much larger than i am used to given i had an invacare tdx si this is just an adjustment i have to make to the chair so my mild frustration to it is on methe chair is comfortable it is quiet and i like the little storage bag way more than i expected to after years of just filling my lap getting it ready to use was very simple as well50lbs sounds lighter than it weighs lol itll be easier to go mobile than my old chair which was around 200lbs but it isnt as mobile as i thought it might be we will see how it goesbottom line is i am happy with my purchase had to come out of pocket for this because my old chair just decided nope not working anymore so i needed a replacement quickly,human
after two days of use i like this chair overall but the beeping buttons are annoying and the turning radius requires some adjustment however its comfortable quiet and met my urgent need for a replacement,ai
i bought these for a pair of dressy shoes  i usually wear the smart  but old looking orthopedic shoes but these were too darn cute to pass up  i really needed some more support but i honestly didnt expect a lot from these  even though they look simple they actually help a lot  they are very easy to use  simply stick them wherever you need them on the sole of the shoe with the preapplied adhesive  the set includes 3 different colors  but i really like the clear ones  you can barely even see them,human
these inserts are simple yet effective they provide extra support and adhere easily to shoe soles the clear ones are nearly invisible which i love,ai

it was a nice tray  smaller than i expected but my walker has  rubber grips and the tray didnt fit over it   now what do i do   buy a new walker   idk what to do to be honest  im assuming all trays will have the same issue due to those grips  companies should realize walkers come with grips and make the trays fit either or somehow,human

im glad this is organic because this powder is often used in traditional chinese medicine given how polluted china is i would distrust anything imported from that country but this one is certified usda organic which gives me some peace of mind you add a scoop to yogurt smoothies etc and its supposed to boost your immune system and improve chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension i dont like the taste but you are taking it for its medicinal properties overall its good quality and best for those suffering from chronic conditions,human
i appreciate that this powder is certified usda organic especially since its often used in traditional chinese medicine its versatile and easy to add to yogurt or smoothies,ai
this is an upgrade from the cheap thin foamfabric shoe insoles it has a nice arch support and adhesive to keep insole in place the leather top also adds a premium feel  i have 3 issues with this product 1 its only a 23 to 34 long insole so your toes wont have any cushioning 2 lining up the insole to my low boots was not easy since the insole is a bit narrower than the boots i had to try several times before finding the best placement it would have been easier with flats with their more open footbed 3 the insole cushioning is limited due to the relatively thin insole,human
these shoe insoles offer a significant improvement over the thin foam alternatives they provide solid arch support and feature adhesive backing to keep them securely in place the leather surface gives them a premium touch however there are a few downsides 1 the insole length is limited to 23 to 34 which leaves your toes without adequate cushioning 2 it was challenging to align the insole with my low boots as the insoles are narrower than expected requiring multiple attempts to find the best fit flats would have been easier to manage due to their more open footbed 3 the cushioning is minimal as the insole is relatively thin,ai
the pros 1 it has 15 different strains of good bacteria this is the most outstanding feature of this probiotic blend it is the case of more is better diversity of the gut flora means the healthier the digestive tract 2 it is delayed release  this ensures that the good bacterium gets into your lower intestines rather than being destroyed by your stomach acids 3 per serving it has 30 billion cfu of probiotic organisms again more is better 4 i have experienced no adverse reactions to the product 5 my overall digestion has improved resulting in good bowel movements and no constipation the con 1 it contains milk so if you have a diary allergy or intolerance you should not take this productin conclusion premiva ultra probiotic is a good solid product that would likely improve your digestion as well as boost your immunity disclaimer  i was fortunate to receive this complementary probiotic in return for my fair and honest evaluation i am under no obligation to give a favorable review i write these reviews in the hope that they will help other consumers like me to make the best purchasing decisions for their money as an avid researcher i have save myself time money and aggravation by reading other customer reviews and i am grateful to have their input available to me,human
this probiotic blend stands out with its 15 different strains of beneficial bacteria contributing to a healthier gut the delayedrelease feature ensures that the probiotics reach the lower intestines rather than being destroyed by stomach acids with 30 billion cfus per serving the potency is impressive since using it ive experienced no negative reactions and improved digestion with regular bowel movements and no constipation however its worth noting that it contains milk so individuals with dairy allergies or intolerances should avoid it overall premiva ultra probiotic is an effective product that supports digestion and immunity i received this as a complimentary item for review but my evaluation is honest and unbiased to help others make informed purchasing decisions,ai

i should have replaced the blades years ago they work excellent i even mowed some of those long gray wild chest hairs and outside of needing to clean out the shaver head repeatedly it worked changing the cutters is easier than it looks dont start prying on the little tabs just push the cutters down one at a time and slip out what a deal,human
i should have replaced the blades much sooner they perform excellently even handling long chest hairs the only downside is the need to clean the shaver head frequently replacing the cutters is simplejust push them down one at a time and slide them out,ai
this ddgro back brace is made sturdyit feels like there is 3 medal type of thin bars in the back that are comfortablei felt good wearing this  actually for my bad posturemy husband wears this when his back is sore or doing some gardening and lifting thingsmy husband wears jeans that are size 32 waist  and i wear a size 8 or 10 this brace is a large and a medium would have been to tight for ushope this helps,human
the ddgro back brace is wellbuilt with three thin metal bars that provide comfortable support its helpful for alleviating back pain and improving posture my husband uses it for gardening or when lifting heavy items we both find the large size fits us well as a medium would likely be too tight,ai
love love love this mask  all my previous sleep masks have had the classic velcro band that goes around your head well i just must have some abnormally large head because after about a month the band would stretch out so i would tighten it and it would stretch again eventually i would get to the last small piece of velcro that could still hold on however this created another problem the rest of the velcro would then get tangled in my hair not with this mask someone finally had the great idea to use adjustable ear loops instead i am so happy  this mask also has a smooth silky cool side and a warm side the only think i would change would be to  raise the material where the eyes are i dont like having the material press down on my eyes however i will deal with it because the good outweigh that small inconvenience love it,human
this mask is a gamechanger unlike traditional sleep masks with velcro straps which tend to stretch out and become tangled in hair this one uses adjustable ear loops it also features a smooth cool side and a warm side for versatility my only suggestion would be to raise the material around the eyes slightly for added comfort despite this minor adjustment the mask offers a superior sleeping experience,ai
love the idea of compostable garbage bags i ordered these for our home for general use mostly in our kitchen garbage unfortunately these are useless because they have a defective thinning line going through middle that makes them tear even if something very light is inside of them otherwise could be a good bag but this specific batch of garbage bags i received are garbage,human
while i love the idea of compostable bags these didnt work well due to a weak thinning line that caused them to tear even with light contents this specific batch of bags was disappointing,ai

im giving this product three stars primarily due to the fact it is a knee scooter and the pad where you put your knee is not very much padding at all in fact its a willful attempted being a good pad and the covering that covers that is even worse with very little use my wife having had foot surgery the pad felt inadequate to begin and degrades very rapidly and the fake leather whatever the covering is on it is made of is like starting to crack and maybe as durable as a wet paper towel maybethats the bad stuff now the good stuff is in terms of mobility and functionality this thing offers quick release adjustment on the handlebars which is far far superior to most of the other brands which you have to take the pin all the way out unscrew it all the way take it all the way out adjust the handlebars and then you have to store it somewhere not very mobile in my opinion so this ones light years ahead of all of those  overall i have to say compared to what else is on the market this thing is a pretty good value for the money but it still leaves a lot to be desired having said that it is the one that we finally purchased similar to how we vote in the united states sadly we had to choose between the better piece of garbage,human
the knee scooter offers excellent mobility but the knee pad could use more padding the faux leather covering wore down quickly however the scooters quickrelease handlebars are a major convenience compared to other models despite the issues its a decent product for the price,ai
it doesnt do diddly squat the rasp is great  it has a coarse grind and a fine grind and it will do the job instead the nail brush is like any other it cleans your nails easily,human

before i had my daughter i went out on a limb and bought this as an in case for diaper blow outs and spit up stains i couldnt be happier it works really well i have found that sometimes i need to spray and soak for an hour or so and then do it again if needed if it doesnt come out after the first wash i end up filling my sink with hot hot water and dumping a little bit into the sink and letting it soak over night if its a really bad stain and it comes right out after that next wash my daughter just started solids which is a completely different stain than spit up and diaper blow outs but this stain remover works just as well,human

ive had moringa tea beforeits been in the leaf form and in a sachet with an herbal teait tasted great and i wanted to reproduce at homethis moring  as its listed  is in a powder form its a very fine powderi was hoping to be able to add it to my tea and just stir it ini was able to get some moringa powder to dissolve into my tea  but not allthis powder is fresh and adds an earthy taste when usedthe bag has 100gms its recommended to use 5gms a day  i figured out that there is about 5gms in 1 tsp i wish this contained a scoop in the bag so i wouldnt have needed to figure it out on my ownthis moringa powder would taste good and mix well in a smoothie i think it would taste  good especially in a green smoothie  the moringa would compliment the taste of spinach andor kalei received this powder 122019 it was manufactured 102019 and it doesnt expire until 092021be careful when closing the resealable bag  the powder is very thin and can get in the zip closure making it difficult to make a full seal,human

in my personal experience the product is pretty great it works best when used along with the many other product natural products inc offers see my review on their  glycolic facial cleanser here honestassortedreviewstumblrcompost147373883057glycolicfacialcleanserreviewthe toner does as it says and works much like expected i have no beef with this product overall great quality comes in great quantity awesome packaging superb overalldisclaimer free for reviewdear selleramazons system is glitching and so i havent been able to upload this review on the proper page i will move this review there as soon as amazon gets its act together but for now it has been added to my review on your other product found herehttpswwwamazoncomreviewrxj8wviyp1wvrefcm_cr_rdp_permim very sorry for this whole mess im sure it will be resolved soon as soon as it is i will more the review to its proper placethe following review is for the dual phase mattifying tonermy personal experienceive been reviewing insta naturals for a while noweverything from their cleansers to their tonersand ive come to really appreciate one thing about this business there are never really any unnecessary additives to their products and generally their stuffs made up of ingredients that are already known to have healing and soothing propertiesthe water feels just so like water however with lavander cucumber sage and calendula extracts it also has a soothing feel and you just know its great for the skinmajor tip try to not apply the product to open cuts pores or scars on the face it does have a mildvery mildsting but that may bother some more than othersdisclaimer free for review,human
ive been using natural products incs products for a while and really appreciate their quality the toner works great and comes in a good quantity its soothing for the skin with natural extracts like lavender and cucumber,ai
this item is absolutely waste of money save your money and instal an actual ceramic coating it is advertised to repel water  but only clean water not rain water with dirt puddle of water on the road or snowi purchased total of 4 bottles in the span of 6months hoping that the layer of ceramic will get eventually thicken but on the 5th time i am gonna purchase this i realized that this does not dot make any difference as if you did not applied iti always have to spray wash my car after it rains other wise all the mud and dirt that came with rain water will stick in your car and even when you spray wash your car with clean water if you dont wipe it dry it leaves horrible looking water marks on the car and if you applied it but you didnt rinse off the dirt caused by rain then your car gets exposed to the sun it causes all the dirt to stick to your car paint makes it even harder to wash your carso just an advice from someone who wasted a lot of money and time for this product just save your money and invest in an installation an actual ceramic coating on your car do not waste your money and time with this fake spray stuff that does not do anything its all an illusionotherwise feel free to try it and agree to everything i said about this product,human
i wouldnt recommend this product despite multiple attempts it didnt repel rainwater or dirt effectively save your money and invest in actual ceramic coating for better results,ai
i only wish the doors would spring all the way open but i like that they rest open unlike many other pill boxes  it seems sturdy at day 1,human

this sound machine comes with a total of 36 sounds ie 6 each of fan white noise nature ocean tones like rain and thunderstorm and hypnotic sounds this is not battery operated it is packaged with a usb cable the unit itself and a regular instruction pamphletoperation is simple as per my video all the controls except for the timer slider and light are in the front of the unit i have to hold press the on  off button in the front to turn it on and do the same to turn it offthere are 6 operational buttons  on the front from left to right the down arrow moves to the next sound mode the broken circle cycles through the sound in the current sound mode the onoff button is in the center and then the minus decrease and plus increase buttons control the volumea tap on the top of the unit turns on the nightlight there are three  states of light on light absorption breathing light and light off if i press hold it will change the brightness despite what i said in my video i discovered that if i lightly press the onoff button while the sounds are playing it will suspend the current sound and i will be able to operate this as a nightlight only without the sounds i did not think i could do thatthe timer slider in the back has only a 30 or 60 minute option or continuous running mode there is also a headphone jack on the back to the right of the port of the usb cablein summary the sounds on this unit are crisp and clear it has a larger selection than many units on the market the nightlight is a nice touch but i wish they had colored lights and i wish this was battery operated no ac adapter is included for the usb cable but most people will have one in their house  the current price of 2799 is competitively priced for this know that there will never be more than 36 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds only a few of them will ever be played i am partial to the sounds of nature myself,human
this sound machine offers a variety of 36 sound options including 6 sounds each for fans white noise nature ocean rain thunderstorm and soothing tones it is not powered by batteries but comes with a usb cable and a standard instruction booklet the operation is straightforward as demonstrated in the video the front of the unit houses all the controls except for the timer and light settings to turn the unit on or off simply press and hold the onoff button there are 6 buttons in total the down arrow shifts between sound modes the broken circle cycles through sounds within the selected mode the onoff button is centrally located and the minus and plus buttons adjust the volume tapping the top of the unit activates the nightlight which has three modes on breathing light light absorption and off holding the button allows for brightness adjustment an interesting discovery lightly pressing the onoff button while sound is playing will suspend the sound enabling the nightlight to function independently the timer offers options for 30 or 60 minutes or continuous operation theres also a headphone jack located near the usb port at the back overall the sound quality is clear and the machine provides a larger selection of sounds than many alternatives the nightlight feature is a nice addition although it would be even better with colored lights a usb ac adapter is not included but most users likely have one available at a price of 2799 it is fairly priced for the features offered however the sound library will always be limited to 36 sounds and unless all of them appeal to you you may end up using only a few,ai
i dont like that its stated as a massager and its not  misleadingi do like the red light therapy with the heat that this device has  i know red light therapy is great to help with circulation  have been using red light therapy for a few years now  so i like having a device specifically for my neck areadoes heat up nice and its soothingbut if youre looking for a massager this isnt it,human
i am not entirely satisfied with the claim that this product is a massager its misleading as it doesnt provide the massaging function i expected however i do appreciate the red light therapy with heat which i know is beneficial for circulation ive been using red light therapy for years so this neck device is a great addition to my routine the heat works well and is quite soothing but if youre specifically looking for a massaging feature this product doesnt deliver that,ai

i thought the 34adjustability34 of this shoe horn would be good  and it might have been except for the spring just above the horn  it makes the shoe horn completely unusable as it bends at the spring  so your foot wont slide into the shoe  if you need a little extra length because bending over is an issue definately go for the solid long handle  i just pitched this one and purchased a solid long handle shoe horn  works like a dream  for the life of me i cannot imagine how anyone thought this one would work  garbage,human
i had high hopes for the adjustability of this shoehorn but unfortunately it didnt work as expected the spring above the horn caused it to bend making it impossible to use effectively this design flaw made it unusable as it prevented my foot from sliding into the shoe if you need extra length for bending over i recommend opting for a solid longhandle shoehorn i ended up tossing this one and buying a sturdier one that works perfectly,ai
this is like a rollon perfume only its infused with essential oils instead i love the scent of freshly squeezed orange juice so i adore this scent it smells fruity but the predominant scent is orange it feels great putting some of this on after a nice refreshing shower on the downside if you use too much you do feel a slight greasy residue on your skin so i would use it sparingly like a perfume but overall i like it,human

i have been enjoying this little sonic face cleansing gadget i havent any prior experience to these facial cleansing brushes always seemed to be spinning style and i didnt not want that style but i pretty much knew what to expect and understand how it works the soft silicone surface is the cleaning brush area and it is static vibration behind it gives action to the silicone bristles and it gently provides cleansing power there are multiple vibration options with a short press of a button long press to hold on auto memory features remembers your last settingas with any skin cleansing brush if you have a face full of make up plan to remove it with a cloth first the idea being that bristles and massage could work it down into pores your  experience school of thought may varythere is no need to press hard against skin just let it glide i use small gentle circles over a wet face slathered in skin cleanser i dont wear much in make up but i always wear sunscreen and other layers of skin care i often double cleanse because of this usually an oily balm followed by a cream cleanser i have dry skin for this i have been skipping the first cleanse with an oil balm and just using the cream cleanser figured for testing purposes to keep it the same for several usesand no it doesnt create lather bubbles it isnt a circulating brush stationary silicone brush with vibration behind it but it cleans i thought well is it just a hand held soft scrubber how could it be better than a wash cloth it is so much better than a wash cloth and so much more gentle and more hygienicmaybe other kinds are better but i can only tell you my experience and thoughts on this avjone sonic facial cleansing brush and is a budget friendly option toomaybe it will vary among users but my skin felt and looked clean not only that but i have been really enjoying the experience of using it my night time skin care routine in particular is a sacred time i aim to enjoy it rather than see it as a chore so i enjoy using more pamper worthy products tools hair bands etc me time and this has added to my experience it is relaxing the whether i use the vibration at lowest setting or highest it has a calming sensation i use it on face neck and chest  the recommended time for cleaning is 1 minute and it will turn off after 3 i go almost the full 3 since i am adding in my neck and chestand i am taking it slowly no scrubbing rubbing or pressure just gentle circles around skinmy cleanser is massaged in it is moved around a little the nubs dont move in circles there is a vibration under them and then when all done i rinse my face and it looks so fresh bright clean i feelsee no traces left behind of sunscreen the lotion was effectively broken down by this it is a notable difference from hand washing or washing with a washclothso for me it works i am enjoying thisthe small device is comfortable in hand easy to use i like the base that it sits on there is a small hole for drainage  i rinse off the device after each use but dont dry it off so i like that it sit up perfectly in this basei really have come to like and appreciate silicone for use in cleaning my face and body seems so much more hygienicthe charger is usb on one end and a magnetic attachment at the device mine came charged and so other than an initial plugin to make sure it worked i havent had to charge it any i have used it 5 nights now each night for 23 minutes at a time debating on whether i canshould use it nightly or not charger may feel hot to touch and is normal do not charge for more than 24 hourswhen i do have to finally get around to charging it i will just have to lay it on a wash cloth or counter top the base is not for setting device in while charging i suppose maybe one day they could redesign the base to include both a drainage hole and a charging portps the direction state not to use it with claybased cleansers siliconebased or granular based cleansers exfoliating creams or scrubsuse cream cleansers oil cleansers water based cleansers the usual just not something that could damage silicone andor create too muchcombined friction on facethats it i like it as i use it more if i experience anything worth sharing i will be back to update,human
ive been enjoying using this sonic face cleansing gadget i had no prior experience with facial cleansing brushes as i was put off by the spinning styles but i knew what to expect the silicone surface acts as the brush and the vibration behind it provides a gentle cleanse there are multiple vibration settings and it has a memory function to recall your last setting its important to remove makeup first with a cloth as the brush is best for cleansing not removing makeup the silicone bristles are soft and ive found it much gentler than a washcloth its more hygienic too while it doesnt create lather it still provides a clean feeling ive been using it for several nights and my skin looks fresh and clean after each use the device is comfortable to hold and i love the base that lets it drain properly overall its been a great addition to my skincare routine,ai
i previously bought a small set of dental tools to use at home for removing plaque between my routine office cleanings i ordered this set on a whim and im so glad i did it is so much nicer than my old set each tool is very sturdy and is longer than any of the tools from my first set the ones ive used so far work quite well it would have been nice to have included some instructions though because this set comes with a lot more than my old one which only had two tools plus the little mirror im not sure what some of these tools are for im sure they all have a specific special purpose i just dont have any idea what some of them are this set comes in a nice case for storage or travel im definitely glad i decided to get these,human

i loved the look of these bags  very blingy with three different kinds of glitter  silver gold rose gold they are not made of the usual thin paper and are meant to be reused not just thrown away after one use making them environmentally friendly which is a plusthe bags are on the small side however so they seem best suited for swag bags or intimate gifts of jewelry rather than large birthday or holiday presents this impression is solidifed by the fact that the bags come with tags saying thank you on them i wish there had been other tags included as well like seasons greetings or happy birthday this kind of limits their usefulness but its easy enough to include your own tag overall these are great for giftgiving,human
i love these bags theyre sparkly with three types of glittersilver gold and rose gold the material is sturdier than typical gift bags and designed for reuse making them more environmentally friendly theyre small though so theyre better suited for swag bags or small gifts like jewelry the thank you tags are a nice touch but it would have been nice to have other tag options such as happy birthday or seasons greetings overall theyre great for gifting,ai

the current price of 999 for this ensemble is excellent and the mask alone is worth that price however if the price were more than 1299 i would have rated this 2 or 3 stars due to the additional items includedthis comes in a giftable box and includes a sleep mask a silk eyeshade like another mask and disposable foam earplugs in a plastic casei am very impressed with the foam mask it is a cushiony soft but fullbodied sleep mask this mask has eye cutouts there is also an adjustable strap in the back since there is an eye socket channel i can open my eyes underneath without touching the front of it and it blocks out all light incredibly well it feels like it is made of cloth covered form it is comfortable to wear and fits me very well and is not too snug it does not move around when i lay down with it overall i really love the maskhowever the eye shade feels more like a lightweight silk mask even when i extend the adjustable strap all the way it pulls tight around my eyes is useless at blocking all light and is supremely uncomfortable the ear plugs are also just junk to me they should leave out both items i only took off one star because the mask is 5 stars if they left out the other junk i would have rated this 5 stars at the current price of 999,human
at 999 this product offers great value the mask alone justifies the price however if the price were over 1299 i would rate it lower due to the included extras the sleep mask is incredibly soft and blocks out light very well thanks to its eye sockets and adjustable strap unfortunately the eye shade is uncomfortable and ineffective at blocking light and the earplugs are poor quality i would prefer just the mask for the price,ai

i am a fairly regular soylent user the bottled 20 liquid  this is the previous version the dry 34you mix it justaddwater34 versionits not bad provided your expectations are set beforehandeven after copious shaking in the bottle there is a slight grittiness and texture that is nearly nonexistent in the 20 premixed  the flavor is different as well  the bottled 20 reminds me of the leftover milk after eating a bowl of cheerios  this v 18 dry mix the flavor is more akin to pancake batter  which is fine as long as you know that going in and dont find the taste of pancake batter unappealingall in all i prefer the taste and convenience of the 20 but can picture taking this on hiking treks where you are pumping water from a stream along the way and dont want to carry the weight  it should also store longer seeing as how it is a dry mix  great for putting away with your emergency supplies i would think,human
i regularly use soylent 20 but this dry version requires mixing with water the texture is slightly gritty even after shaking well and the flavor is more like pancake batter than the premixed 20 which reminds me of leftover milk from cheerios its not bad but its different i prefer the 20 for taste and convenience but can see this being useful for hiking or emergency supplies due to its long shelf life,ai

really surprised how bad this product is all around considering its billed as the latest thing in teeth whitening hard to get the swabs out then handle is too shout for effective use worse yet it stings on the gums after the first use  makes teeth hurt even when not usingparticularly when brushing in addition it will not work on a synthetic tooth i have one in front that was shattered in an accuse replaced  is darker than my natural teeth this made things worse by slightly lightening the other teeth but not the dark one wish i could get my money backwhat a waste,human

i cant make up my mind whether these are good for the environment or not theyre meant to be disposable but only after youve used them a number of times they look like paper towels but are thicker with some of the durability of a rag yet because they look like paper towels its fairly easy to toss them out accidentally after only one use if you forget i know i didthese are good if you remember not to toss them out after one use  so i suppose theyre no worse or better than rags which you must toss out eventually at any rate anything disposable no matter how many times you reuse it is not good for the environment but if you must use something like a paper towel i suppose you could do worse than these,human
these are meant to be disposable after multiple uses but i often forget and end up tossing them after just one use theyre thicker than paper towels but not as durable as rags so they seem to fall somewhere in between not ideal for the environment but if you need a reusable option these are decent,ai

i was hoping this would be a handy multifunction trimmer and chose it because of the large assortment of attachments the trimmer works well with the preinstalled attachment and the blade is sharp enough for a relatively close shave without bloodshed however trying to remove it is impossible  according to the instructions you need to grasp the unprotected blade head with your finger to release it and then pull it out by the sides  whilst i was trying to position my hand so as not to engage the large power button that is literally the entire upper half of the shavers body i felt the blade bending on my third attempt and gave up also included in these kits was an empty usb power block casing in addition to some major design flaws where is the quality control,human
i chose this hoping for a versatile trimmer due to the variety of attachments while the preinstalled attachment works well and the blade is sharp for a clean shave removing the attachment was difficult the instructions suggest gripping the unprotected blade to release it but it bent on my third try so i gave up also the kit included an empty usb power block casing indicating potential design and quality control issues,ai

when my doctor suggested stinging nettle root to help me breathe i decided to research and see the benefits and cons of the herb the more i researched the more the all natural supplements sounded like the right choice i looked at many different brands before deciding on these im satisfied that i got these the capsules arent too big to swallow and leave no nasty aftertaste with any kind of supplements youd expect to be able to smell the ingredients but these have no smell they start working within a few days of beginning them and within one week i was breathing better than i had in years they help to clear out sinuses and keep chest clear do breathing is easier these are a less expensive brand and are a great value for the money,human

we live in sunny and hot southwest florida having proper eye protection during the day is critical to your longterm eye health  not only that but my eyes have changed as ive aged and i need reading glasses to see anything up close  finding a way to keep both pairs of glasses close and handy became very important to me  after seeing a friend wear both pairs of glasses around his neck i realized that his method worked very wellsince you virtually have one or the other pair of eyeglasses on most of the time there just appears to be one pair hanging from your holders across your upper chest  need to put on your sunglasses when going outside  just switch from your reading glasses no more putting your eyeglass cases down and forgetting to take them with you  no more glasses falling out of your pockets and getting bent or broken when you or a friend steps on themi bought two different pairs to try out these holdie classic pu leather and a new pair of croakies premium leather  both are leather both have adjustable rubber clips to fasten to the bows of the eyeglasses and both can be adjusted to fit just about any type of eyeglass bow  these are both versatile because the design of the rubber clips allows you to fasten them to most types of eyeglass bows the type of holder that has hollow cloth or rubber ends lets the glasses slip out of the holders and fall off  plastic clips instead of rubber tend to break under stressthese holdies are a 34number one best seller34 on amazon with 191 reviews and a 43 star average rating  they are sold in a 3 pack for 1299 for an average cost of 433 per unit  each of the three units comes in a different color for matching your outfits black dark brown and light brown  nice touch that  my only concern is that the leather straps 2634 long are flat and made of raw leather  that can be a problem in hot climates as raw leather think leather watch bands can absorb sweat and begin smelling a bit funkyoverall though its nice to have three different colors and know that they are wellmade  they also have a bead in the center of the strap to allow you to tailor the length to whatever you are comfortable with  made in china but well executed,human

update 2522 i tried to give this blow dryer a shot on the highest wind setting at medium heat mind you it normally takes less than 10 minutes to dry my terribly fine thin hair it didnt even make it halfway through before it crapped out dead the plug didnt shut it off it just died with all of its shortcomings and now this its a definite no go2322 this eniseca 1875 watt negative ionic hair dryer is not as versatile as it is made out to be i was really looking forward to being able to change the temperature and wind settings to my liking i have fine thin hair and need a lower speed with hotter temperatures than most blow dryers have with this blow dryer its impossiblethe only time you can adjust the temperature is if its on the highest wind speed which is totally ridiculous if you lower the wind speed at all it goes to the coldest temperature which is even more ridiculous i do appreciate being able to change the temperature on the highest wind setting but i need a lower wind setting and a higher temperature setting than cold and i do mean coldafter deciphering the meaning behind this seemingly faulty setting they make it appear that a lower wind speed should only have low temperatures for childrens sake i didnt buy this blow dryer for a child i bought it for myself furthermore i would not want to blow dry my childs hair with cold airthis blow dryer could have been a super win all around but instead its a flop for me its fine if you only blow dry your hair on a mediumhigh speed at all times but for those of us who dont or cant do that its pretty much useless just to note the highest wind speed setting is not nearly high enough to please those with thick long hair but it  get extremely hot this is not my favorite,human

i was very interested to try this supplement as i like to take most of what is in the pills for immunity especially during the stressful winter months  i did not realize that a bottle only lasts 10 days if taken as directedsizethe pill size is standard and not hard to swallowodorthe odor of the pills is not excessive or intensedigestive issuesi had no issues with burping upset stomach or other digestive problems when taking thishow i took thisi took this as two capsules a day when i was feeling a bit under the weatherdid it helpi did see that it helped me just by taking 2 capsules in a dayhow is this supposed to be takeni was shocked when i read the instructions to take six capsules a day which amounts to this bottle only lasting 10 days  that means at 20 a bottle at the time of this review that you would be paying 60 a month to take this supplement  i am not sure it is worth thatcountry of originthis says on the bottle that it is manufactured for a place in fl and formulated in the us but it does not say where it is actually made that i can find on the bottlethe bottom linealthough this helped me some at a lesser dose than recommended if taken as it says it is pretty expensive  i am not sure it is worth it to get 3 bottles a monthmy ratingthree stars  although it does work it is a bit high priced and the bottle contains so little compared to monthly recommendations i can not rate this higher than 3 stars,human

i have previously reviewed this item from this or some other seller and am reviewing again in specific response to the very negative review by one person who seems to only have account to give negative reviews on this item  i am a real person with hundreds of amazon purchases and reviews  reading reviewer profile is important i thinkthis is my earlier review from item listing on another vendorthe only one ive tried that works well i have had three in the past the first split at the point of entry as i tended to push it a bit too hard causing compression at entrypoint local vendor advised the problem and next two did not have same point of failure they last about a year soft ur3 material warms up well and ribbed inside enhances the experiencea critical thing it is long enough so one does not lose lubrication out the end  messy and loses the charm of the experience it also accommodates larger users  it is 75 inches long where most others fail fastit will accommodate girth others just split out the end after couple uses there is some difference in the sensation from each end one being a bit tighter on the point of entryone description called it a pocket toy naaaa this thing is 75 inches by 25 inches and weighs about a pound walking around with this thing in the pocket would be noticedclean up is very easy with warm water and absolute minimal amount of soap be sure to rinse well as soap could cause some rash next time it is used the box includes a small pack of powder corn starch that they recommend using after each use or washing i never used it on previous ones and it lasted well enough i think the powder is to dry quickly to avoid bacteria and such i shake well after washing and store in a terry cloth with the flat end pointing downwards the end that has two holes putting this end up allows water to remain inside and you will see water next time if you store wrong end upit has a bit of a scented powder smell when you open the box it is from the scented corn starch i dont like the smell and would toss out the little package of scented powder and just use corn starch if i wanted to use powdernot easiest to find though i hope amazon keeps selling it even with one reviewer chasing after every vendor while having almost no other presence as a reviewer,human

i have tried many diet supplements on the market most of them without results i decided to try this one and their 34carb and fat attack34 i also reviewed that one this supplement while i have not lost any weight yet it did stop my weight from climbing so i am going to assume that i am in a transition plateau phase i havent been exercising regularly so i am sure that is attributing to my stall  i started walking more regularly and eating better in conjunction with the other supplement vitamins and fruit smoothies im sure that with this product the weight will start to come offnow as for effectiveness i do notice a change in my energy i suffer from severe fatigue and i do find that i have more energy throughout the day when i take this i keep it down to a minimum because of the caffeine because i refuse to give up coffee and taking the full dosage with coffee does have me climbing the walls so i reduced the dosage to 1 mug of coffee in the morning and 1 capsule before lunch to keep my energy up this works for me i am sure it will take longer for me to see weight reduction results because i am taking a smaller dosage but i am sure that i need to be on this for more than a month to see the results and considering that i am having no ill side effects and everything seems to be okay i think i will stick with this for a while longer and post my results of weight loss if any at a later date for energy i highly recommend,human

decent socks  although like many things the creators seemed to forget that big people are actually big  the size 13 fits the foot itself pretty good but the top of the socks get extremely tight on larger calves  i understand that tight is the goal but pain discoloration  numbness should not be  there really should be a bit more stretch to these especially with the prints  as is when taking them off i can clearly see the design of the sock imprinted into my skin  ive been compromising by folding the tops down  the whole experience is pretty great that way but i was kinda jazzed to have high top socks that didnt constantly remind me of every inch of my legs in  a bad way  oh well my quest continues,human

unlike the plastic tubs this canister looks good on the counter yes that matters to me of course what matters most is whats insidein addition to type 1 and 3 collagen there is whey and instant whole milk powder which helps boost the protein to a nice 20 gthe chocolate tastes high quality but then its ruined by too much monk fruit extract as a sweetener at least for me i know a lot of people will appreciate the sweetness because this is a product you can mix in just water as an aside personally id rather not have the oft used stevia either if they insist on it being sweet a bit of organic sugar would make it taste more natural and i wouldnt mind the extra calories it makes a very nice hot cocoa type of beverage even in water it tastes creamyanother thing i like is that there is no plastic scoop hiding under the powder thumbs up for friendlier packagingsomething else to like is the bottom of the canister which has both the date of manufacturer as well as expiration date that kind of transparency is greatly appreciated it instills trust,human
the canister looks great on my counter which is important to me the product inside provides a good 20g of protein but the chocolate flavor is a bit ruined by the excess monk fruit extract some people might like the sweetness but id prefer a more natural sweetener like organic sugar overall it makes a nice hot cocoa and i like the lack of plastic scoops and clear labeling,ai

ive had this table a couple of years cons it has a permanent 34lean downward34 towards the center of the bed also one of the legs kept sliding down the button kept slipping instead of staying in the hole causing that side of the table to cave and everything would fall off my husband drilled a hole and screwed that leg permanently at the level of the other leg if the manufacturer wanted to improve on the design they could insert corner supports under the table top where it meets the legs that could prevent the 34sag34 or lean downwards towards the center of the bed the other way it could be permanently improved would be to create the tabletoleg at about a 50 to 55 degree setting instead of the 45 degree which causes the sag even placing diagonal metal supports from the legs to the table would keep the table up and horizontal to the bed pros its very easy to slide out and replace when you need to change sheets the table top also has a 34lip34 all the way around that helps keep items from sliding off the table its lightweight easy to clean doesnt rust we live on an island and you can place it closer to you or farther down the bed wherever you want it without any trouble at all if you do spill anything remember the lean you have more time to mop it up because of the lip around the top,human

was glad to see these arrivethese are made well and will be quite usefulthe 510 threading goes way down through the center  i cant imagine any rda rta or anything else with a 510 connector being too long to screw down into these threads and bottom out before it meets the base  nicely donethe base does not come with any kind of antislip material stuck to the bottom but it is machined out so you can attach one if you are so inclined  i will measure this machined inset and look around for something close that fits with an adhesive backing but even without it it will be very useful for building on or storing an atty while something else gets some mod timethank you for making these  they are priced reasonably enough that it will save me the timetrouble of making some myself  these address a very practical need for any vaper that has a topper with a 510 connection  especially if its a rebuildabledefinitely recommend,human

free product given for evaluation  review this is a nice 4 ounce amber glass bottle of pure moroccan rosewater  the amber glass bottle keeps the contents from going rancid as quickly  rosewater is excellent for toning and refreshing the face as well as for me various household projects such as soaps and sucha few reasons i took this review from a five to a four  the smell  compared to another usda organic rosewater i have the other brand is more light and refreshing  smell for smell i like the other one better  on the skin this spray actually feels a little heavy  it makes me skin super soft which is great but it leads me to believe these is oil in it somehow but what do i know  my other rosewater as well as rosewaters in the past have been light like water and delicate in consistencythis seems to be a nice brand and i truly enjoy using it but when compared to a like product which i love this one falls slightly behind it,human
free product given for evaluation  review  this is a good quality amber glass bottle of pure moroccan rosewater the amber glass helps preserve it longer while the scent is a bit stronger than other brands ive used its still pleasant the spray feels a little heavier on my skin but it makes it feel soft compared to other rosewaters this one is slightly less delicate but its still a good option for toning,ai
this is the correct battery for my waterpik sr 3000 electric toothbrush so when it died i assumed that replacing the battery was the smart move  ive been soldering small electronics since 1968 and i correctly soldered the leads from the device to these very small tabs much smaller than picture would suggest  i put the toothbrush on its charging stand and its flashing lights indicated it was charging  24 hours later the button on the device was still nonresponsive  battery replacement is not a sure thing,human

not as tough or as strong as the original as seen on tv product goes flat faster good price the originals last forever these will last a while they still help with plantar fasciitis will opt for originals from now on if you find the originals have too much height for you then these would be a great alternative option seems to be a different type of filler material for pad i would give originals 5 stars plus these i would give a 4,human

i really love these towels there are 50 cloths per roll for a total of 150 cloths over the three rolls the exterior design is festive starting the roll is difficult because the first piece is glued on real tight however once i got the first piece off i was good to go i was able to wash the counter with these or clean parts of my cats litter pans they are strong and reusable i do feel the current price of 1799 1999 minus 10 off is expensive however if these rolls last long and i can reuse more than several times then it might be worth it because at the current discounted price it comes to 12 cents per sheet only time will tell how long this will lastthis would have gotten 5 stars if they were not so pricey however this might not be 5 stars for everyone since it is a papertowel like cloth when it is wrung out it is hard to unravel i found myself picking apart the squeezed out cloth,human

selling carrier oil with maybe a drop or two of the named oil i purchased a three bottle set in a department store does not have any aroma whatsoever,human
i bought a set of three bottles from a department store and there was no noticeable scent whatsoever it seems like its just a carrier oil with maybe a drop or two of the named essential oil,ai
when i clicked on this listing i assumed automatically that these bottles were glass they look like and shine like the many other dark amber glass bottles i have in my cabinet and are not listed anywhere otherwise in fact i understood the 344 pound34 shipping weight as a confirmation that they were glass this package was not even half a poundi am unsure of what type of plastic this is as there is literally no labeling or info about product other than how to mix colloidal silver i do not feel comfortable letting my daughter inhale out of the nasal sprayer in a plastic bottle bpa or non bpa plastic is not safe at all let alone storing silver in it youd think when dealing with those who use colloidal silver they are already researching they are looking for real products that work and are mindful of chemicals plastic is a no brainer on my list of do not buysi wish the seller would have provided a more in depth description that goes further then the 34 2 sprayers and 1 dropper for all your asap silver sol needs34 that was providedthese will just be thrown awaythe shipping was way too long they charge a restocking fee for returned non damaged items and for 8 dollars total im ok with just throwing them away though i wish i knew sooner so i wouldnt have wasted so much timeill just go buy an overpriced glass bottle set at whole foodsvery unhappy with this purchase,human
i expected these to be glass bottles but they turned out to be plastic they look similar to the dark amber glass bottles i have and i even interpreted the 4pound shipping weight as an indication they were glass the product description only mentions the sprayers and dropper with no details about the plastic material im not comfortable using a plastic bottle for something like colloidal silver as i prefer glass unfortunately this product did not meet my expectations and ill be disposing of it the long shipping time and restocking fee were also disappointing,ai

but for what they are these have packaging that is quite different than what im used to  i mean most tissues are short squat rectangular boxes or more square upright boxes  of course there are the little disposable ones that women like me carry in their purses but ive not had any that are in a tube before  i love that i can store one in the car by using a drink holder  so much easier than rooting in my purse for a tissue when i feel a sneeze coming on  the packaging itself is pretty me being a girlygirl kind of person i do appreciate the colors and plants on it  the tissues themselves are sturdy and soft enough that i feel confident that even when reaching for one to contain one of my big sneezes that i do have more often than i would like i dont worry that the tissue might suffer a crack in keeping my explosive sneeze contained  the only thing i noted here is that the cost is a bit high but for a tube of tissues that fits well in the car it is worth the price at least to me,human
this tissue packaging is unusual but i love that it fits in my cars drink holder the tissues are sturdy and soft and the pretty design is a plus however the cost is a bit high though its worth it for the convenience,ai

i got this for my husbands lower back pain  when i first put it on his back all was well  a few minutes later he was fanning his back saying it felt like lava  we washed some of it off because he couldnt take it and he said it felt better  im not sure if i applied too much but i used a very little amount to start with  less than a pea sized amount  after the inital lava stage he said it did cool and seem to numb his lower back area and was soothing but that the initial skin melting stage wasnt worth the cooling after wards  if you dont mind extreme heat this would probably work for you  weve used sombracream and icey hot extra strength with no problem but those are nothing in comparison to this  we received this product for a discount in exchange of an honest review  my opinions are my own,human

there arent many in a package so they seem expensive or i might get them again they taste quite good hardly different from almonds but smaller and maybe a light woody edge to them as i got the sweet ones it really wouldnt be possible to eat so many that they became toxic but the package is so small probably couldnt eat too many of the bitter ones either which seriously can be toxic and can even kill people the notion that they have health benefits beyond those of the almond are absurd though  that theyre sold even to cure cancer proves only theres a sucker born every minute health canada warns that cyanide poisoning is a real threat and health benefits not the least likely but the sweet ones have far too little of the chemical that breaks down into cyanide and the liver can clean that up in a jiffy,human
the quantity in the package is small so it might seem expensive but the taste is quite good the flavor is similar to almonds with a slight woody taste i purchased the sweet variety so its not a concern to eat them in moderate amounts but the bitter ones can be toxic if consumed in large quantities while some health claims are exaggerated the sweet variety is safe for consumption the small quantity is the only downside,ai

my kids wear school uniforms khakis and polos and they come home every day with oily black marks all over their clothes from the recycled tire pieces used as a base on their playground additionally they have the normal kid stains food paint dirt etc ive never used a stain remover before but figured that would be cheaper than continuing to throw away clothesthis arrived in the mail yesterday and as luck would have it haha my daughter came home in khakis completely covered in black marks so i got to test it right away i followed the directions on the back of the bottle and treated the entire weeks worth of uniform clothes so some stains had had a chance to set in after one round through the washer about 90 of the stains were gone i did a second treatment on a few spots and rewashed everything and those khakis i would have otherwise thrown out were completely stainfree when i removed them from the washer there was also a white shirt from earlier in the week that had gotten paint on it in art class and that came out completely too the only stains that didnt come out were a spot that looked like it may have been from a sharpie and a grass stain honestly though these could have already gone through the laundry once before and set in so i cant say for sure that this wouldnt have worked on themi didnt notice this anywhere in the description but this product does have a slight smell kind of like baby powder also it leaves a soapy residue on anything you spray it on and clothes required extra rinses to come cleanoverall im amazed at how this took really tough stains out of clothes and i am so glad to have found something that will save us from having to constantly replace clothing because i went through about twothirds of a bottle on a single load i think ill be buying this at target from now on since their website has it much cheaper,human

i had high hopes for this item but it didnt go well from the start  as it says in the information sent with the device this is not a hearing aid and if you have problems with your hearing then you need to contact a doctor  honestly if you think you need an item like this then thats exactly what you need to do  you need to contact a professional so that you can get some real assistancethis device is marketed to baby boomers of which i am one  but this is a very challenging device in many ways  many baby boomers and most seniors would never be able to set the device up   much less be able to operate it once its all pluggedin  this is the reason the jitterbug cell phone was created    keep it simple  this device is anything but simple especially for those for whom it is supposed to be geared toward most seniors do not want   need   or desire fancy gadgets with lots of buttonsif this item were 5995 then i would give it higher marks   but   its not  its many times that and not worth iti was able to set it up without too much difficulty but i know many of my friends would have simply left it in the box  even if someone had their child or grandchild set it up for them they still will be lost as to how to operate itthree of the functions  modes i just dont get  if you need a headset for a telephone then you can get one very inexpensively  no need for this  if you have trouble hearing people and carrying on a conversation with someone then you probably need to see a professional about having your hearing tested and acquiring a real device for assistance  i dont know anyone who wants to walk around with what looks to be an odd mp3 player with earplugs to talk to people  the third function of playing sounds is just kind of annoying  at first i thought it might be nice   but   i was listening to what i would call waves   its obviously on a loop playing the sounds over and over   but   there is a beginning and an end    so when the loop finishes its not a smooth transition to start playing again  you notice where it ends and then starts again  personally this is very annoying  it should be a seamless loopnow for the one function that does indeed work and i actually like    watching tv  once you set it up you can actually listen to tv and it works just fine i like this because i live in a condo and though the walls a quite thick i still dont want to turn the tv up too loud and there have been times when it would have been more enjoyable to have a headset like this  granted there are a few issues with this also  first it will work with just one tv because you have to run a cord from the tv to the base of the device  second the information shows that the battery will last about 65hours in tv mode  granted thats a bit of time but if its a weekend and you want to watch a lot it still might not be enough  it takes 5hours to charge the device as well  also if you have the earplugs in to watch tv then if you have other people around you youre probably not going to be able to socialize  youre either going to be watching tv with the earplugs in   or    not have the earplugs in and socializing  also the earplugs are not all that comfortable  im assuming i can use other earplugs or earphones i find more comfortable  i havent tried that yet but im assuming it will workbut even though i like the tv part    there are much less expensive and better options if thats really what youre looking for  i did a search on amazoncom and there are some great options    a lot less expensive     and cordless,human

so a couple of things i noticed i did this on a day where the back half of the house was in full sun and the front was in shade the windows in the back were super hot and the crystals from this started showing instantly and seemed to come out better so people with poor results on this might try heating up the window with a blow dryer first or something if its cold out the front windows still did decent just took them some time to dry and the crystals to show upi can say from experience dont overdo it all at once on a window if you do then youll get runs in your crystals and it detracts from them a bit so lightly spray the window and let it dry for a bit and once its dry to touch decide if you need to follow up with another coatpro tip if you want it to look professional then use a piece of cardboard along the edges as you spray or tape all of your window trim with masking tape before spraying this especially around darker window frames if you have white window frames then it probably wouldnt be an issue i have dark brown aluminum frame windows and the over spray of this looks kinda junky it does wipe off though so i just have to find time and go out and wipe the edges down for a cleaner lookoverall im truly amazed by the frozen window look these created i did it for privacy and you cant see past it it looks great its very classy looking,human
i did this on a day with varied sun exposureback windows were hot and the crystals showed up much faster for better results try heating the window beforehand in cooler weather avoid overdoing it applying multiple coats in stages works best for an even finish using cardboard or masking tape around window edges prevents a messy overspray the frosted look is fantastic for privacy and looks very classy,ai

my boyfriend and i are highly impressed with this set there are two pretty lilac heating and cooling wraps we heated them in the microwave for two minutes each one they come out really warm and are soothing as a neck wrap to lay over the shoulder around the arm or leg  these can also be used cold by putting them in a waterproof plastic bag in the refrigerator for at least four hours to chill we personally only use these for heat therapythere is velcro along one end to keep the wrap in place one has to be careful not to let the velcro touch any delicate clothing because it is strong and can damage delicate fabrics like sweaters the wraps are unscented and made of clay beads and millet as a result of the ingredients they are heavy these wraps cannot be washed they can only be surfaced cleanedthe current price of 2299 for these two wraps is very reasonable we are both highly impressed,human

i tried several brushes over the last several months and love the kozis wooden bath brush amazon item  b08hr2gbhc the best however this one is very good toothe brush head side is ample for good coverage the bristles are of medium softness the massaging side is not useful to me because i have no desire to use that in fact i do not even understand why anyone would use that the brush is hefty and is one solid piece which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes i tried previously it also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower in addition a selfstick hook is supplied if needed but i did not use itbesides the massaging brush head that i find useless the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than i would like many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back nevertheless this is still very functional and it is very well madeoverall i like this brush even though it comes in second to the kozis i love the current price of 1199 is about right for a twosided wooden brush,human
ive tried several brushes and this one ranks highly for me its solidly built with a nice heavy handle and rope for hanging the massaging side isnt really my thing but overall its a good product for the price,ai

i purchased this in pink and the dusty rose color is misleading  it is a hot pinkhowever thats my only real complaint  i have adhesive sensitivities and haveyet to encounter a k tape i can wear for more than 24 hours  so there is that limitation but not an unexpected one  i use this on things like wrist strains and also to secure magnets to painful areas for magnet therapy  the peel off grid on the back of the tape makes it easier to estimate the amount needed for a task especially if you have taped the same area beforefor the newly initiated a general rule of thumb in taping a small area to secure it is to have one length of tape stretched 75 and the matching strap cut longer and unstretched like for a wrist  medium size areas like knees may require one unstretched and two stretched 50that sort of thing  never stretch both pairs 100  that may feel super supportive until it makes your skin peel a lesson learned from my previous roll of k tape  try to go to a pt or chiro for instructions,human

the upside is that unlike most magnesium pills these arent enormous and hard to swallow they are in standard size gel caps the downside is you need to take two to get less than the giant horse pills usually include i dont have a particularly difficult time swallowing large pills so its all pretty much the same to me these are good and so are the larger ones its all about what you prefer and how much you need,human
one advantage of this magnesium supplement is its manageable sizeits in standard gel caps not the oversized pills that are difficult to swallow however to get a similar dose to the larger pills youll need to take two of these i personally dont find swallowing big pills a challenge so its not an issue for me overall these are effective just like the larger versions its all about your personal preference and dosage needs,ai

my definition of attractive may be disputed but when i say that this is accurate i mean it the first thing i did after i unboxed the review sample that i received from the manufacturer was to test just how accurate it it a few notes i am not going to regurgitate the product description or specs on this page i will give my impression and highlights that led me to give this five stars also mine shipped with an included tape measure which was not mentioned in the description at the time of this review its actually a high quality one that has an autoretract mechanism that adds even more value to this seti test a lot of scales so i have standard weights that are used for calibration and in this case comparison my approach is to use different weights then repeat the weighing there was no deviation among the results from all testsin addition i also performed the same tests using a different scale and received the same results my conclusion is this is accurate per the product description right out of the boxyou can switch among pounds kilograms and stones by pressing a button on the underside of the scale plus this is accurate to one decimal place in 2 increments so you can see detailed results if you are battling the pounds or kilos or stones as well as weigh objectsa few things that i especially like about this scale are the large display which is a big deal at my age and the blue lit background i also like the fact that it will come alive as soon as i step on it and give me the bad or good news after a few second lag and will go back to sleep shortly after i step off of itamong the scales that i have tested this one stands out in ease of use display quality and accuracy its heavy and well made and the fifteen dollar price tag at the time of this review makes it an incredible bargain if you could see one in person youd be as impressed as i am,human
to me this product is accurate and i can confidently say that after testing it ill skip listing the product specs but i want to highlight that the scale is precise easy to use and has a useful bluelit display its even more impressive when compared to other scales offering great value for its price the included tape measure is a nice bonus adding even more convenience,ai

i like the sturdiness of these insoles yes they are very hard and hard to cut but if you want a firm supportive insole they have to be firm they give me the best support in my foot wear yes it took a long time to trim them down to size but the feel and comfort they provide is worth it this is not a flabby insole which would be a waste of money and until i found these ive been wasting lots of money these insoles are quality made and i will certainly purchase another for my boots these insoles come all the way to the toe giving full support,human

i am really excited to find a nonfish source of omega 3s and in a gelatinfree gummy too as a vegetarian this is a huge discovery i am bewildered at the reviewers who mention anything about a fishy taste or smell this is an entirely plantbased product it tastes like a fruity gummy vitamin the only thing i would change is the quantity in the bottle this may not make a difference to many consumers but i bought this in conjunction with another wow supplement this bottle contains 30 servings while the other product contains 50 servings it would be far more convenient if the products contained the same number of servings so they are on the same refill schedule otherwise im very enthusiastic about this new supplement discovery i did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review,human

okay im just going to say it i dont brush my teeth enough ive got a nice soniccare electric toothbrush in the bathroom but because im retired and dont have to get dressed up to go out anywhere i dont have a grooming routine i dont have an alarm clock either i needed something like this to keep close to me to help me remember to use it so when i was offered the product at a discount in exchange for my honest review i was pretty happy about being able to try itim sure im not the only senior who wears comfortable clothes and falls asleep in them if my clothes are not dirty ive been known to wear them for days at a time im probably also not the only senior who doesnt register what day or time it is half the time i keep my hair cut very short so if i forget to comb it nobody will notice i work on my computer almost every waking moment and it seems the only time i get out from under that cloud is when im in the kitchen cooking its only when im waiting for the microwave to finish or the coffee pot to stop perking that i suddenly become aware of my bodyat which point i usually realize i need to brush my teethive tried keeping a spare manual toothbrush and toothpaste in the kitchen both have a tendency to fall into the sink with the dirty dishes i like this brush because i can clip it to my t shirt or pocket where it looks like some kind of space pen and whip it out for a quick brushing while im waiting for the microwave to finish i love how you can quotdialquot out just a little toothpaste not so much as to require a lot of water do a quick brushing then rinse at the sink stick the brush back into its cap and get back to what you were doingmy toms of maine toothpaste tube wasnt a perfect fit for the screwon end through which you fill it but it was good enough i just turned the dial down as the tube filled with toothpaste dialing it back up with the thumbscrew pushes the toothpaste up through the center of the brush it doesnt take much i dont know what people are talking about with quotcleaningquot it i wouldnt bother with that i think as long as you rinse the brush end well and dial a tiny bit of toothpaste back into the bristles like flushing a syringe theres no reason to have to clean the toothpaste reservoir just put more toothpaste into it when its getting low i would thinkdisclaimer i came of age at a time when kids actually played in the dirt and exposure to germs was considered a good way of building up immunity if youre one of those people who showers three times a day and has to clean everything to within an inch of its life all the time you probably wont like this toothbrush,human

ive recently discovered the wonders of gel manicures no drying time and they last for weeks sign me up i love the colors included in this set they are very vibrant and bright the colors go on fairly thin so it takes a couple of coats to get good coverage the glitter polish is a bit on the chunky side which is pretty but rather hard to get it to look even the polish arrived nicely packaged in a box with foam to hold it in place and a color dot on top of each bottle to quickly identify the colors since gel polish arrives in black bottles im happy with it so far and would order this again,human

i wasnt expecting a whole lot from these clippers given the price point ten bucks as of this review i was really surprised at how well these work the blades cut as well as models costing far more a nice clean cut without any pulling or abrasion the length dial works very well it has a nice smooth action with a solid positive click stop for each length it comes with two guides so you have two sets of adjustability lengthswhere the costcutting is seen is with the case and attachment build quality its all plastic and doesnt have much of a solid heft to it i very much doubt this would survive a fall of a few feet onto a hard floor im not willing to test that out so i may be wrong about that but the very plasticy nature of the clippers dont make me at all confident in their ability to shrug off damage the guide combs are also rather thin but since they connect to the body with an internal peg versus having to pull them off the blade itself the thinner build quality is fine with regard to durabilityit charges with a usb c cable included which is a nice change from having to keep and use a transformer specifically for the clipper  the motor has a muted buzz that is reasonably quiet and not annoying theres only one control which is a sliding onoff it clicks firmly into place and stays put in usewhile these are lightweight in terms of build quality it punches well above its weight class when it comes to performance five stars,human
i didnt expect much from these clippers at the price about ten bucks when i bought them but i was pleasantly surprised by their performance they cut just as well as higherpriced models offering a clean cut without pulling the adjustable length dial works smoothly with firm clicks for each length it includes two guides giving you extra adjustability the only downside is the plastic case and attachments which feel flimsy and might not withstand drops but for the price the performance is excellent im impressed,ai

it is a very good concept that could work for adults that work at a desk with their water bottle next to them but even though they need to be vigilant as the device only blinks once  and if they miss it and do not drink the device eventually shut down i think it should be refined at least with repeated blinking when the first blink is missed  or perhaps it should be a warning bip sound instead of the first blink followed by repeated blinking after a while if the is missedthis does not  work for children,human

i love this scent perfumey and potent i barely use any of these in the wash and they do the trick the scent is strong so you dont need much it dont really know what to compare the smell to other than it smells like a feminine perfume floral but with a bright citrus note too on clothing its very mild but if you are washing a picky males laundry you might want to try something more herbal my husband doesnt care one way or the other so this is fine for usi know fabric softenersscent boostersadded stuff are not that great for fabrics but i like my laundry to smell clean i respond to scent and i have found that i enjoy doing laundry much more if i have nicely scented things to usei was using purex crystals but the packaging is deceptive its only about 34 of the way full i also have to use more in order to get the benefit of the scent the downy packaging is a bit better and i do the tiniest sprinkle one bottle lasts a long timethey open easily i guess so people can try the scent before purchasing and people can steal right from the bottle i have found halfempty bottles on the shelf before a friend of mine works in a department store and she says people will dump the entire contents into a ziploc bag and walk out with it so be sure to check your bottles when you make a purchase its easy to just grab a bottle thinking its full and get home to find that some is missing especially if youre a distracted mom and are in a hurry to get home before your child has an instore meltdowni now make my own laundry detergent and i use these in one of my batches i make a softeneradded stuff free batch too for towels and i am very happy with it only one step and no measuring when its time to wash the recipe i use is from a blog called aprons n pearls and the post is called homemade laundry soap if you want to google it i found it on pinterest it uses washing soda borax fels naptha and other ingredients plus these you only need a couplefew tablespoons per laundry load so one batch lasts a looong time it takes about 2030 mins to make iti purchased this through prime pantry and it was 699 with a 200 coupon which is still a little bit more than what id pay in my grocery store but i needed a new bottle before i would have a chance to run to the store i paid extra for the delivery but in store this is much less expensive especially if you can find a coupon,human

id never even heard of white noise machines before i became a parent and now im practically a white noise hoarder i have one in each of my kids rooms a portable one for travel and one that gets left at grandmas house in case i forget mine plus a couple extras you know in case one breaks its bad i have a problem but theyre just so stinkin soothing and they cover every squeak of the floor in my 100 year old house so i can sneak into my sleeping kids rooms without waking them up of all the white noise machines ive had this one has the least annoying bonus sounds of all of them i usually just use the various white noise settings but on this one the nature sounds and music are actually really nice im impressed i wish there was a way to have it rotate through all the songs instead of play twinkle twinkle little star 500 times in a row but other than that theres really nothing about this that i dont like the light is soft and you can select the color of light you prefer or have it fade through the whole rainbow a rechargeable battery would really knock this out of the park so i could have the option to use it without being plugged in but its not something i really need i guess i would definitely recommend this to any new parent,human

discounted or free itemis it good or badill make the providerauthoreither happy or sadand sometimes even madone of my earliest memories is going with my father to visit grandpa  the reason that i remember those trips so vividly is that dad would always take an electric drill with us on those visits  it turned out that the purpose of those visits was to grind down grandpas thick toenails  i was still too young to understand that the human body often provides us with some surprises but now ive developed a few of those thick toenails myself  in addition it appears that grandpa is responsible for my thick nasal hair and fastgrowing long hairs that grow both inside my ears and on my ear lobes  three cheers for grandpafortunately most of my toenails are normal and dont require extra attention but up until now it was a real project to keep the affected ones trimmed and under control  previously i was somewhat successful using a special set of heavy duty clippers that have long handles for leverage but the results were often raggedy and unattractive  so being offered this set of clippers for testing and review was a welcome and timely circumstance  these beautyme nail  toenail clippers appear to be extremely wellmade and durable  the handles are long and ergonomic and the blades are curved and extremely sharp  the vendor describes these as 34premium qualitysurgical grade and i have no reason to doubt themthe combination of the long handles for leverage strong spring for strength and extremely sharp curved blades makes for an effective and precise set of clippers  they work like a charm on my thick toenails  the one caution i will give you is to be extremely careful to avoid having the blades cut your skin when using them  toes tend to be very sensitive and bleed quite a bitnote  if you hit the 34more34 button under 34about the product34 on the amazon product page you will see two erroneous references to their blackhead remover kit  perhaps the company should review and change that verbage,human
whether its a discounted or free item it can go either waygood or bad i remember visiting my grandpa as a kid and my dad would always bring an electric drill to grind his thick toenails now ive inherited some of those traits including thick toenails fortunately these beautyme nail  toenail clippers are extremely wellmade with long ergonomic handles and sharp curved blades they work perfectly on my thick toenails but be careful as the sharp blades can easily cut skin,ai

i couldnt get this device to stay put in the toe box of my shoe once it was inserted and expanded  and so it was  not useful at all  am returning it  also  after having read other reviews which suggested this device may be too big for some shoes i even ordered a size smaller than indicated by my shoe size even so it was impossible to jam it all the way into the toe box and then when it was expanded it slipped out even fartherits a design flaw  if it had an adjustable wood block on the other end of the threaded bolt that could be used as an abutment against the back of the shoe and it would keep the device in place with that design change  i think this device would work well but as its currently designed i found it useless,human

this make up brush is so dissappointing good quality makeup brushes are not hard to find but the kind that retract seem to be few and far between i was so glad to find this little brush because i travel a lot and have trouble keeping my make up brushes cleanas soon as i opened the package the lids fell off they are so loose that it is no use even trying to use these brushes for their intended purpose i tried crimping the lids a little so they would grip but it was no use they simply do not fit well wont stay on and that is all there is to it this is not a fluke because i also ordered the retractable blush brush made by the same company and it has the same problemthe actual brushes are not my favorite and this little eye shadow brush has made its way to the bottom of my make up drawer to languish for a respectable amount of time till i decide to face that i will never use this  even if i liked the brush no matter how good the brushes are if the lids dont stay on the whole purpose of a retractable brush is defeatedanother weird thing is that the seller was supposed to be a company called books from boulder the package came from target i could have just driven to my neighborhood target store and bought these without paying the shipping very strange,human

i had tried  bath bombs which are the same as these but in a smaller size unfortunately this large size performs slightly differently as ill describe belowthere are 3 super large individually wrapped bath bombs in this set all are large clouds with a smiley face on the package coveringeach one is strongly fragrant when dry and lightly fragrant when in the bath they also all have the same scent the ingredients are sodium bicarbonate citric acid magnesium sulfate water cyclodextrin peg400 hydrogenated jojoba oil hydrogenated grapeseed oil butyrospermum parkii shea butter oil natural essential oil fragrance and fda approved colorantsthese are very very large and fun they perform well produce a lovely rainbow of suds and dissolve in about 1015 minutes the fragrance is subtle in the bath however there is one difference in the results read onsince i personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath i use them in a foot bath when i was done the color did not adhere to my foot bath but it turned both my feet pink and  my drying towel note that the smaller bombs did not do this even though they are the same perhaps it is the extra profusion of color in such a large size this is the only reason i rated this 4 instead of 5 starsthe current cost of  1999 for 3 bombs comes to a very expensive 666 per bomb however these are certainly way different from typical bath bombs i like these very much but would have loved them if it did not color my feet and towels note that the color does wash off the towels in the laundry and in the shower for my feet,human
these large bath bombs are fun and perform well producing lovely suds however they left pink stains on my feet and towels which was a downside for me the color washes off in the laundry but the extra coloring in such large bombs could be problematic for some,ai
