As an older individual who has tried countless types of socks, I can confidently say these are the best I have ever used. They fit perfectly – wide and tall – with just the right amount of elasticity. The customer service was exceptional, addressing my minor concerns with kindness. Being a family-owned business, they prioritize customer satisfaction, and these socks are well worth every penny. Additionally, for those with peripheral neuropathy, these socks offer light support, reaching nearly up to the knee and staying comfortably in place. Truly the best socks I’ve ever owned.
This is, without a doubt, my favorite scent. It’s incredibly refreshing and perfect for my flat. Highly recommend!
Unfortunately, this product did not work as expected. My hair frequently got tangled, and even after charging it, it didn’t heat enough to curl my hair effectively. I returned it.
The bottles broke within a couple of months.
I bought these for my boyfriend and me to write down date ideas. They’re perfect for couple or best friend gifts, and they come with paper inside each pill. A wonderful gift idea!
I’m really pleased with this brand and plan to reorder soon. I’m happy I found it.
Love these bags!
The left-side cradle should be larger to accommodate phones with protective cases.
The longer strip worked great for my MCL injury, staying in place much better than other lidocaine patches I’ve tried.
These work perfectly for my homemade deodorant. They're easy to push up and very convenient.
I've tried Moringa tea before, both in leaf form and as an herbal tea sachet. This powder is fine, but it doesn’t dissolve completely in tea. It has an earthy taste and mixes better in smoothies, particularly green ones like spinach or kale. A scoop would have been helpful, as I had to figure out the right amount myself. The resealable bag can be tricky to seal due to the fine powder.
I used these sheets during my trip to Singapore, and while I needed more than one sheet per sink for optimal results, I was satisfied once I adjusted.
I bought this as a gift for my mom, but putting it together was a challenge and it felt cheaply made. It required electrical tape and a bit of frustration. However, it works fine now and the light is bright enough for her to read better.
After trying an expensive dental guard from my dentist, which was uncomfortable, I found this alternative and couldn't be happier. It prevents me from grinding my teeth at night.
This lotion is great for dry skin and works well on all parts of the body.
The product is well-made and fits as expected. My daughter is very happy with it.
The flat back was missing, but everything else was great.
This is the best and safest way to kill weeds. Mixed with salt and dish soap, it works quickly without harming the soil. I always keep a couple of gallons on hand.
My only issue is with the top. It doesn’t have a specific tip for pouring, making it difficult to control the amount.
These chill quickly and are very comfortable to wear.
I love this product! It works really well and tastes delicious!
This container is much larger than I expected, holding about 10 pills, while I only need three. It’s more than I was looking for.
A very useful tool that is soft and easy to use. It’s also easy to clean.
I enjoy adding essential oils to my colognes, and this blend is perfect for the summer. It complements fragrances like Spice Bomb well. The applicator makes it easy to apply just the right amount. Highly recommend it!
I love this product! I organized the entire month with it and ended up buying six of them.
I heated these in a small crockpot, and they held heat incredibly well, even after I was ready to move on. I added essential oils, and they absorbed them nicely. They’re a good size, and one of my kids dropped one without it breaking.
This mattifier cream doesn’t hold up as well as others, especially for men who don’t wear makeup over it.
These worked great for collecting colostrum before birth and stored well in the freezer. However, the tape didn’t stick, and I couldn’t write the date on them, which was a bit frustrating.
We love this detergent! It’s perfect for our baby’s sensitive skin and has very little scent. I also appreciate the convenience of having it delivered to my door.
This brush is sturdy with just the right bristle firmness. I replaced a much softer one with this, and it works great to reach my back.
I’ve been using fish oil for years, and this trusted brand is my go-to. Despite not being fond of the taste, the lemon flavor makes it much more bearable. It’s a great value for the quantity and packaging.
These feel more like a rag than a paper towel, but I love the designs!
We live on a mint farm near the beach, and this product has been a hit for my grandchildren. It works great for keeping bugs away in our sunny, mosquito-heavy area.
I found Natural Armor’s essential oils to be misleading. They claim to be organic, but they’re not certified, and the company’s response to my query was unsatisfactory. Buyer beware if you’re specifically looking for organic products.
I’ve used Amino Derm for a long time, and it works well to make my skin smooth and clear. It helps reduce oiliness and breakouts. The herbal smell might not be for everyone, but it’s a great natural skincare option.
The product works as described, and I’ve noticed that some teens can hear a high-pitched sound that older individuals can’t. It’s like a dog whistle and a bottle opener.
I’ve never used this type of mouthwash before, but it’s fresh and minty without the burn. It seems effective for eliminating bacteria and odor, and the concentrate offers good value.
This oil is high quality with a pleasant scent. It’s clean and I will definitely purchase it again.
After my weight loss surgery, I struggled with getting the right vitamins. These vitamins have been a game-changer, as I only need one per day (aside from iron). They’ve made it so much easier to get the nutrients I need.
This arm sling looked good in the photo, but it’s made to completely immobilize the arm, which was uncomfortable for me. After trying it on, I returned it and bought a more standard sling locally.
I’ve been using Natural Products Inc's products for a while and really appreciate their quality. The toner works great and comes in a good quantity. It’s soothing for the skin, with natural extracts like lavender and cucumber.
I wouldn’t recommend this product. Despite multiple attempts, it didn’t repel rainwater or dirt effectively. Save your money and invest in actual ceramic coating for better results.
The doors on this product don’t spring all the way open, but I do like that they rest open.
This sound machine offers a variety of 36 sound options, including 6 sounds each for fans, white noise, nature, ocean, rain, thunderstorm, and soothing tones. It is not powered by batteries but comes with a USB cable and a standard instruction booklet. The operation is straightforward as demonstrated in the video. The front of the unit houses all the controls except for the timer and light settings. To turn the unit on or off, simply press and hold the ON/OFF button. There are 6 buttons in total: the down arrow shifts between sound modes, the broken circle cycles through sounds within the selected mode, the ON/OFF button is centrally located, and the minus and plus buttons adjust the volume. Tapping the top of the unit activates the nightlight, which has three modes: on, breathing light (light absorption), and off. Holding the button allows for brightness adjustment. An interesting discovery: lightly pressing the ON/OFF button while sound is playing will suspend the sound, enabling the nightlight to function independently. The timer offers options for 30 or 60 minutes, or continuous operation. There's also a headphone jack located near the USB port at the back. Overall, the sound quality is clear, and the machine provides a larger selection of sounds than many alternatives. The nightlight feature is a nice addition, although it would be even better with colored lights. A USB AC adapter is not included, but most users likely have one available. At a price of $27.99, it is fairly priced for the features offered. However, the sound library will always be limited to 36 sounds, and unless all of them appeal to you, you may end up using only a few.
I am not entirely satisfied with the claim that this product is a massager. It's misleading, as it doesn't provide the massaging function I expected. However, I do appreciate the red light therapy with heat, which I know is beneficial for circulation. I've been using red light therapy for years, so this neck device is a great addition to my routine. The heat works well and is quite soothing, but if you're specifically looking for a massaging feature, this product doesn't deliver that.
So far, I'm really happy with this brush. The seller sent a helpful email with care instructions when the brush arrived. No hairs have fallen out yet, which is great. My only minor issue is that the brush is slightly too thick to fit easily with the Perfecto brush stand. It's been over a week now, and I love the brush—it’s much better than the cheaper ones I’ve had before.
I had high hopes for the "adjustability" of this shoehorn, but unfortunately, it didn't work as expected. The spring above the horn caused it to bend, making it impossible to use effectively. This design flaw made it unusable, as it prevented my foot from sliding into the shoe. If you need extra length for bending over, I recommend opting for a solid, long-handle shoehorn. I ended up tossing this one and buying a sturdier one that works perfectly.
This product is essentially a roll-on perfume, but infused with essential oils instead. The scent of freshly squeezed orange juice is absolutely delightful—fruity with a dominant orange fragrance. It's wonderful to apply after a refreshing shower. However, if used excessively, it leaves a slight greasy residue on your skin, so a small amount is recommended. Overall, I really enjoy it.
This is a great alternative for someone who doesn't enjoy tea. I dislike the taste of tea, so this supplement is a perfect solution for my detox days. I can take a pill and instantly feel more focused and less bloated. It doesn’t cause any sudden trips to the bathroom; instead, the effects are gradual. My skin looks clearer, my stomach feels less bloated, and I have more energy.
I’ve been enjoying using this Sonic face cleansing gadget. I had no prior experience with facial cleansing brushes, as I was put off by the spinning styles, but I knew what to expect. The silicone surface acts as the brush, and the vibration behind it provides a gentle cleanse. There are multiple vibration settings, and it has a memory function to recall your last setting. It’s important to remove makeup first with a cloth, as the brush is best for cleansing, not removing makeup. The silicone bristles are soft, and I’ve found it much gentler than a washcloth. It's more hygienic too. While it doesn't create lather, it still provides a clean feeling. I’ve been using it for several nights, and my skin looks fresh and clean after each use. The device is comfortable to hold, and I love the base that lets it drain properly. Overall, it's been a great addition to my skincare routine.
I initially purchased a small set of dental tools for home use and decided to upgrade to this set. I’m glad I did! This set is much nicer than my old one—each tool is sturdy and longer. The tools I've used so far work well. The only downside is that the set includes more tools than my previous one, and I’m not entirely sure what some of them are used for. It would have been helpful to include instructions. Still, the case is convenient for storage or travel, and I’m happy with the purchase.
I have a smaller mouth, and these fit well. At first, I could only chew on them for short periods, but I’ve gradually increased my usage. They’re much more comfortable than the $25 ones I’ve tried.
The product is larger than I expected.
Exactly what I’ve been looking for.
This smells fantastic and blends well. It’s surprisingly good for a vegan protein powder. It’s become one of my husband’s favorite protein powders.
This product works as advertised. While it’s not a perfect substitute for an actual paint touch-up, no wax product truly is. However, it effectively reduces the appearance of small imperfections and chips. I used it on my old black vehicle, and it worked wonderfully. I tried it on my Nissan Murano in blue, and while it wasn’t as impressive as the black, it still made a noticeable improvement.
I’ve been using this product while following a fasting and Atkins diet to help manage my calorie intake. On fasting days, I aim to stay under 500 calories, and this product helps curb my hunger while still tasting good.
The product arrived on time, in good condition, and met my expectations for fit, form, and function.
This is my second purchase. Every two years, like clockwork, I need to replace my transformer. I can now do it myself—no more service calls. It was reasonably priced, arrived quickly, and fits perfectly!
Everything seems to be working fine with no side effects.
The product works perfectly, and it operates on batteries.
I probably won’t use these. Although they weren’t expensive, they didn’t provide the silence I was looking for. Unlike my Anker ANC headphones, these let me hear my own heartbeat and breathing, which was just as disruptive as the snoring. I’ll look for active noise-canceling earbuds instead.
I bought this as a gag gift for my best friend for Christmas, and she loves it! She uses it regularly. The light helps locate hidden stones in the crannies of her tonsils, and the three attachments are very helpful too.
Good refills for my journal.
These are excellent for quartering ducks after a hunt.
This product didn’t work for me. The straps were too wide to fit comfortably under my arms.
I was initially concerned this would have a fishy taste, but I’m pleased to report that the flavor is acceptable. It has a slight lemon flavor, and the fishiness is nearly imperceptible. I plan to take two teaspoons daily to see if it helps lower my slightly high cholesterol, and I will update this review later.
It’s natural and great for the scalp.
I love these bags! They’re sparkly with three types of glitter—silver, gold, and rose gold. The material is sturdier than typical gift bags and designed for reuse, making them more environmentally friendly. They’re small, though, so they’re better suited for swag bags or small gifts, like jewelry. The “Thank You” tags are a nice touch, but it would have been nice to have other tag options, such as “Happy Birthday” or “Season’s Greetings.” Overall, they’re great for gifting.
This tongue scraper works really well without leaving a metallic taste. I use it every morning, and it helps me feel like my mouth is completely clean to start the day. I dry it off after each use to prevent rust, and so far, it’s been working great! As a fun note: I keep it in the same cup as my toothbrush head, and if I lift my toothbrush out incorrectly, the magnet sticks to the scraper.
The product adheres to the shower wall for a couple of uses at most. A slight bump causes it to fall off, and it can only hold the shower head at one specific angle. I wouldn't recommend it to others.
I used these to block out my noisy roommate while trying to sleep, and they worked really well. They are a bit difficult to wash, but overall, they're very practical. I'd buy these again!
The item didn’t come with any instructions, so I had no idea how or when to use it.
This iron is great for boosting ferritin levels!
No soap needed for this product, as it contains cleansers and a soothing lavender-chamomile fragrance. Perfect for a quick wash, especially while traveling. It's very convenient to use.
A great product for promoting healthy lung function.
It's cute, but it doesn't bend at the waist or tail, only the arms. This limitation makes it difficult to pose them realistically.
At $9.99, this product offers great value. The mask alone justifies the price. However, if the price were over $12.99, I would rate it lower due to the included extras. The sleep mask is incredibly soft and blocks out light very well, thanks to its eye sockets and adjustable strap. Unfortunately, the eye shade is uncomfortable and ineffective at blocking light, and the earplugs are poor quality. I would prefer just the mask for the price.
My husband says it works wonderfully for his back.
I regularly use Soylent 2.0, but this dry version requires mixing with water. The texture is slightly gritty even after shaking well, and the flavor is more like pancake batter than the pre-mixed 2.0, which reminds me of leftover milk from Cheerios. It’s not bad, but it’s different. I prefer the 2.0 for taste and convenience but can see this being useful for hiking or emergency supplies due to its long shelf life.
Perfect for steaming veggies quickly when cooking for multiple people. It’s easy to clean and retains nutrients. I also steam yams, and they come out moist and flavorful, unlike overcooked vegetables.
The size is perfect, and it effectively helps with muscle relaxation.
I attached these to two pieces of wood to prevent them from blowing off in high winds. They stay attached much better that way.
The sizing is significantly off. This is based on Asian sizing, not US sizing! An Asian size 14 is equivalent to a US size 6.
I’m really disappointed in this teeth whitening product. The swabs are hard to remove, and the handle is too short for proper use. After the first use, it caused gum irritation and tooth sensitivity. It didn't lighten a synthetic tooth either. I wish I could get a refund; it's a waste of money.
My husband loves this for his wool socks. They’re like new again after using it.
A decent supplement overall. It helps alleviate some knee pain and is beneficial for general health.
I really enjoy the taste. It’s quite good!
Mom’s podiatrist recommended this for her, and it works just fine.
I mainly use this on my shower curtain and to clean the floor with my battery-powered brush. It works really well.
The Monoi scent is wonderful, but it's only noticeable if the air vents are blowing at full speed. It doesn't act as a freshener in a closed vehicle. For the price, I wouldn’t buy it again.
These are meant to be disposable after multiple uses, but I often forget and end up tossing them after just one use. They’re thicker than paper towels but not as durable as rags, so they seem to fall somewhere in between. Not ideal for the environment, but if you need a reusable option, these are decent.
I’m a big fan of mushrooms, and this product has really made me feel clearer-headed. At 67, I feel more energized throughout the day when I take it regularly.
Just as described. It works well.
Excellent quality, great quantity, and fast shipping. Definitely will buy again.
The texture is much silkier than regular baking soda, and it’s less clumpy. The holes are a bit large, though, so I wish there were options to control the flow better. Still, it’s very convenient to use.
Served its purpose well – I used it to hand-wash dishes while the kitchen was being remodeled and didn’t have a sink.
It’s okay, but I ended up going back to Prebiotin powder for my prebiotic needs.
The top-stitching along the edges is quite scratchy. I had to cover the pad with a double-folded Queen-sized sheet for a smooth surface. It does protect the mattress, though, and my child stays dry at night.
I love this veggie scrubber! It’s easy to grip and works well. Plus, I love the wooden design.
Maty’s is the best chest rub I’ve found after 15 years of being a mom. It’s incredibly effective for soothing coughs and colds, as well as for calming anxiety and sleeplessness. The all-natural ingredients are non-greasy and gentle on the skin. It’s a staple in our medicine cabinet.
I purchased six of these at Costco. The first two worked really well, keeping mosquitoes away for a week. But after a while, the mosquitoes came back, and the product didn’t have the same effect. I switched to a stronger spray and got better results. Not the best long-term solution.
Love the length! It makes it easier to reach the back of my head. However, the power button is in an inconvenient spot, causing me to turn it off accidentally when holding it upside down. Once I got used to it, though, I was able to avoid this.
After a few months of use, this iron no longer works as well. It doesn’t get hot enough to iron hair properly, and it stays warm but not hot. I’m disappointed with its performance and would suggest investing in a higher-quality iron that lasts longer.
It’s a hassle to have one towel for cleaning and another for drying.
I don’t understand the hype – this didn’t moisturize my lips at all. I ended up throwing it away.
I can’t provide a fair review since my doctor prescribed a higher dosage than the over-the-counter brands.
These don’t block out sound at all.
The tissue boxes seem to have fewer tissues now, so I go through them faster than before.
The product is nice, but be cautious as cornstarch can encourage fungal growth, and applying talc can cause other issues.
My husband swears by this supplement for his neck stiffness. It’s been a long time since he complained about his neck pain, and he asked me to set up regular refills. I take it occasionally, and it seems to help with my knee issues as well.
The back support is good, but the straps tend to loosen, and it slides on my shirt. The XL size was too big for me, and I couldn’t tighten it enough. It fits well around the waist, but I need something tighter for better posture support. It’s a solid option if you get the right size.
It’s cute – whatever gets the kids to brush their teeth!
Highly recommend buying this product.
I bought this for my Yorkies, as they tend to have poor dental health. The product is advertised for small dogs, so I thought it would be suitable, but it's actually much too large, and it has a strong plastic odor. Neither of my dogs showed any interest in it. I'll be giving it to a neighbor with larger dogs instead.
My daughter uses this supplement for vitiligo, as it contains many of the nutrients she needs. With this and additional supplements, we've seen some improvement, so I believe it's making a positive difference.
The suction works well, but the holder for the shower spray is a bit too small to provide a secure grip. I might need to tighten it more, but the original holder from the shower system was larger and held the spray in place without problems. Depending on where you attach it, it could work well for you.
My 85-year-old mother has low vision and struggled with regular nail clippers. These worked perfectly for her. They help her maintain some independence, which is important to her.
I couldn't handle the taste of this product—it was so bad that I had to mix it with other flavors to make it somewhat bearable, but that didn't work either. The taste made me gag. I'll be discarding it, but I appreciate that it doesn't contain unnecessary ingredients.
It didn't cut a small pill well. I had to really hold and adjust it to get the job done.
I prefer Kleenex over Puffs.
The color is a faint, transparent gold, and the quality is thin, but it's still acceptable.
This product works great for my needs. I take medication daily, and it holds a lot of pills while taking up far less space compared to carrying individual bottles.
This mister turns ordinary water into hydrogen-rich water, which helps prevent oxidation and hydrate your skin. It's compact, perfect for travel, and an excellent way to refresh your skin on the go. I highly recommend this product. I hope this review helps with your decision.
The tissue boxes are poorly designed, but the tissues themselves are the softest I've found, so I continue to purchase them despite the unattractive boxes.
I can't believe how much my complexion has improved just by drinking this tea. It makes my skin soft and glowing. I've always used natural skincare products, but this tea has noticeably enhanced my results. I’m 53, and people have even thought I was in my early 40s. I'm so grateful to have tried this amazing tea.
The product stayed in place even in windy conditions, though the ribbons it came with were too short. I used fishing line instead to extend them, and it worked fine.
The product works well but isn't sturdy enough to move around easily with your feet under a desk. The metal stick that holds it in place doesn't fit well in the slots, causing it to collapse when moved. It's too cheaply made for the price.
This little shaver and trimmer is perfect. It does the job and is very compact, making it ideal for travel.
This tool is fantastic for any kitchen. It removes tea stains from cups with a single swipe using just water. It also works on baked-on grease and stubborn food spots in frying pans without damaging surfaces.
The applicator for makeup is a bit awkward and applies the makeup unevenly. While it's easy to clean and reduces bacteria spread, I’m unsure if I’d buy it again due to its patchy application.
This recovery drink is great for hydration and restoring lost minerals after exercise. It contains BCAAs, taurine, collagen peptides, and other essential nutrients to help your muscles recover and rehydrate your body.
We use this stain remover for our baby’s clothes, and it’s fantastic! It gets milk stains out easily, and the scent is pleasant. I even use it for my older children’s clothes. This product works wonders for anyone with sensitive skin or frequent stains.
I’ve bought this product multiple times because it works for me. It helped lower my blood pressure by 10-15 points, allowing me to reduce my medication. The tablets are large, but for the price, it’s worth trying.
I love this product. I mix it into my hot tea in the evening, and I've recommended it to friends.
This torch lighter is well-constructed and sturdy. It holds a lot of gas and is easy to use, with a reliable ignition every time.
It works well, but it took several pumps before I got the traction I needed.
It met my expectations and did exactly what I needed.
I make this my go-to morning tonic every day.
The size is a bit off for my eyes. They don’t stay on unless secured in a towel or something.
These work great for a one-time use at a party. I bought two, and they worked for a couple of short bursts, but one stopped working after only two uses. The other one also died after a short time. I reached out to customer support, but they ignored my request. I won’t buy these again.
This tool is fantastic! My feet look and feel amazing after using it. I'll definitely buy another one when this one wears out.
These vitamin C gummies are a nice alternative to the typical orange flavor. They taste a bit like grape, though they are supposed to be blueberry-flavored. They’re vegan and have zinc and echinacea, giving me a little extra immune boost.
Gentle yet effective—my teeth have never been cleaner.
The product works well but isn’t as high-quality as I expected. I had to trim the opening to fit my charger, but it works fine overall.
These clippers didn’t work well on my Yorkie’s shaggy hair, though they did fine for shorter areas. They might be more suitable for short-haired pets.
The size of this product feels a bit short, almost like it’s made for smaller people. I also received one with Chinese writing on it, which made me question if I got a knockoff. It doesn’t pick up large debris as expected, but for the price, it's an acceptable option.
The leaves are amazing, and the service was excellent. I'll buy again and tell my friends!
This straightener is perfect for travel. It's small enough to fit in a purse or laptop case, and it heats up quickly. It's the ideal solution for on-the-go styling.
It doesn't stick to my shoes.
If you're looking for extra comfort while sitting, this Wondergel cushion is a great option. I bought one for myself and my wife, and we’re both pleased with it.
These vitamins are great for my toddler who struggles with meat. He loves the taste, and his latest blood test shows no issues with his hemoglobin levels. They seem to be working well.
I'll definitely buy one of these every year!
These earplugs are excellent for both sleeping and swimming. They’re the best I’ve found.
The product arrived already opened, which was disappointing. I was really looking forward to using it.
I bought this product because of concerns about my oxygen levels during COVID. It worked well and kept my O2 levels above 90, which eased my mother's worries.
The bath sponges arrived securely packaged. They are large enough for my son, and he’s really happy with them.
I liked that this didn’t disintegrate or trap food, but it’s a bit thin.
These compression socks are super comfortable and easy to put on and take off. They provide good support and are much more comfortable than others I’ve tried. I’ll definitely buy more.
They would be more comfortable if they were the full length of the shoe.
It's really convenient to have this available.
It works great for clearing my little one's nose, and even my husband uses it too.
I chose this hoping for a versatile trimmer due to the variety of attachments. While the pre-installed attachment works well, and the blade is sharp for a clean shave, removing the attachment was difficult. The instructions suggest gripping the unprotected blade to release it, but it bent on my third try, so I gave up. Also, the kit included an empty USB power block casing, indicating potential design and quality control issues.
These sleep masks are soft, lightweight, and comfortable – a nice well-made option.
I used this product for about three months, but it didn’t seem to make any difference, despite my regular workouts. Disappointing.
This is an excellent purchase. It's well-made, and both the lights and alarm function perfectly. I’m bringing it on my Russian river cruise!
I regret putting this replacement cover on my baby shower registry because it's quite pricey.
Save your money – apple cider vinegar works much better.
No pinching, and it curls easily!
The size is perfect for me. I get cold easily, so I keep it behind me on the couch for warmth. My husband uses his for different needs, and we both enjoy it. The material is better than our old one, which was hard plastic. This one feels more like a blanket. Plus, it was FSA eligible, so even better!
After my doctor recommended stinging nettle root for easier breathing, I researched and found it beneficial. I chose this brand after considering several options, and I’m glad I did. The capsules are easy to swallow and have no aftertaste. They started working within a few days, and I noticed an improvement in my breathing. They clear sinuses and help with chest congestion, offering great value for the money.
Living in Southwest Florida, protecting my eyes from the sun is crucial. As my eyesight has changed with age, I also need reading glasses. Finding a way to keep both pairs handy became essential, and I found this method works well. These holders allow you to carry both sunglasses and reading glasses without worrying about forgetting them or damaging them. They’re adjustable and come in three colors to match your outfits. Although the leather straps can absorb sweat and start to smell in hot climates, the overall design is good.
I purchased this oil to treat yeast issues under my armpits. After applying it, the itching and swelling were controlled, and I will definitely buy it again.
This Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM combination has been effective for my joint pain. I take it for my back and knee issues while awaiting a diagnosis. The capsules are easy to swallow and have no unpleasant taste. It also supports cartilage health, immunity, and skin. I recommend it, especially for joint health.
I’ve tried various foot massagers over the years, but this foot steamer is by far the best for my sensitive soles. It uses minimal water, so it’s not too heavy, and it provides a relaxing, comfortable steam. I wish it could use essential oils or special teas, but overall, it's a great product.
Copaiba oil has been incredibly helpful for a family member who suffers from muscle cramps. Combined with coconut oil, it eases sore muscles better than other over-the-counter products we’ve tried. There was a shipping issue, but the seller resolved it perfectly.
These supplements are very relaxing, always top quality, and offer the best value with no sugar or fillers. I highly recommend them.
Lightweight and durable – perfect for various uses.
This product really works, helping to mask the signs of smoking!
After years of using prescription Meclizine for Vertigo, I find that this Rising Health version works just as well. It makes me a bit sleepy but helps reduce the spinning, though it doesn’t completely eliminate the symptoms. It’s a great product, and I’d definitely recommend it.
I appreciate the significant amount of direct skin pain reliever, which helps with the severe pain caused by herpes zoster nerve damage.
I lost my old electric corded massager and ordered this replacement, thinking they sent me the wrong one. After receiving another, I realized the first one was exactly what I wanted! It works great on my rough feet from walking barefoot. I’ve been using this brand for years and will continue to do so.
Ziploc bags are reliable and these have a Green Bay Packers logo. Perfect for fans, and the gallon size is ideal for so many uses.
I’ve worn this product for a few days, and my left heel pain has improved. I hope the results last.
These syringes are easy to read, with clear markings. They work smoothly for both thin and thick fluids. They come in a box for convenient storage and are individually sealed. Great value for the price, especially when on sale. Highly recommend.
They work great.
This shaker bottle is perfect for my pre-workout and BCAAs. I feel much better knowing I’m not using chlorinated water from the gym.
I purchased these for my business and use them for sample goody bags. They’re durable, come in a variety of colors, and are the right size for my items. The price is great, and I highly recommend them.
The product arrived quickly and works perfectly. The display is large and bright, making it easy to read.
This product has a strange texture, like liquid oatmeal.
After trying various plant saucers, these are by far the best. They are thick, sturdy plastic, and prevent water from leaking, unlike the flimsy ones from other stores. I highly recommend them.
The top came unglued.
It doesn’t whiten well, but it does leave my breath feeling fresh.
This product is misleading – it only contains 10 small patches, which is much less than expected.
This was a waste of money. My cats are actually attracted to it.
The flavor is a bit too sweet for my taste, but it’s still a good product with added B vitamins. It’s an excellent value, and I appreciate that it has a long expiration date.
It’s about to expire.
I bought this for my elderly mother with spinal stenosis. She prefers this pad over typical chair or scooter pads and takes it everywhere with her. She loves it.
This product worked as promised. I took it as instructed, and my cardiologist confirmed my cholesterol had lowered. I’ll definitely keep this in my routine.
I followed the instructions carefully but didn’t see any noticeable difference. The instructions and packets were easy to follow.
I’ve purchased several wooden spoons from Hekunn, and this one is just as impressive. It’s high quality, functional, and works well with non-stick pans. I appreciate the craftsmanship, and while the delivery took longer than expected, the products are definitely worth the wait.
These are very sturdy and precise.
The product arrived with one-day delivery and was installed by my daughter. It’s well-made and works excellently.
While I wouldn't describe these as soft, they are perfect for exfoliating, which is their intended purpose. I’m very satisfied with this product.
High-quality tissues.
These gloves are ideal for dishwashing or household cleaning tasks. They protect your hands effectively during these chores. The quality seems solid, and the cotton flocking inside makes them comfortable, absorbing some sweat. At $10, they offer great value, and I would recommend them.
After a brutal allergy season combined with dust from renovations, I tried this product on a friend’s recommendation. I was surprised at how quickly it opened up my sinuses without causing any fogginess or drug-like effects. It works so well that it’s now a permanent addition to my medicine cabinet!
Excellent quality hot water bottle. I really like it.
These are great tweezers and very affordable.
I prefer this over my previous mia. It cleans well and effectively removes makeup, leaving my face refreshed.
Initially, I was unsure about this foot peel, as it took about four days for noticeable peeling. After that, the peeling was intense for several days. If using this before a vacation, I recommend doing it a couple of weeks in advance for the best results.
This product is very moisturizing and works well.
This was perfect for my granddaughter's 5th birthday party. She loves mermaids, and it fit her theme beautifully.
This item doesn’t stay in place and falls off easily while in use, making it dangerous. I weigh 135 lbs, and I can’t rest my foot on it. I would not recommend this product.
The product is working well.
As a frequent traveler, I appreciate these bars. They’re convenient, not too large or sweet, and provide just enough sustenance until I can have a proper meal.
This is the best cotton rope for vaping with rebuildable atomizers that I’ve found on Amazon.
This product doesn’t curl lashes at all, and I find it ineffective.
I've been using this for years and love it. I will definitely buy it again.
I like that these probiotics contain 10 billion CFU from 4 strains, and only one capsule per day is needed. Although they’re a bit pricey at over a dollar per capsule, they don’t upset my stomach, and I feel better when I take them. They’re also free from gluten, dairy, and soy.
It’s too early for me to give a valid review as I’ve only been using this for a few days. It takes time to see any positive or negative effects.
This is the perfect size to fit over my scooter. I’m very happy with it.
This product is helpful when grocery shopping, especially for glasses wearers.
Initially, I thought this was a great idea, but it turned out to be a hassle. The seat part is loose fabric, and it becomes heavy when wet, making it hard to hang without fear of breaking.
This product effectively keeps my glasses on during workouts or outdoor runs, though the wax leaves a film on the lenses that requires wiping off with a towel.
I’ve heard about ashwagandha powder and its health benefits. After trying it, I find it has no strong taste or odor and blends well into smoothies. I’m curious to see if it has positive effects over time.
This pill splitter is exactly what I needed. It’s small, easy to use, and works well, ensuring that pill halves don’t get lost.
I add this to my morning drinks and smoothies, and it’s a great addition.
Unfortunately, my daughter loved it, but it was broken upon arrival.
After my dog’s surgery, I needed packing materials and bandages, and this product worked perfectly.
These toothbrush holders were purchased for Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes. They are sturdy and affordable when bought in bulk.
I used this product during my vacation in Australia, and it was fantastic for sticking to my injured foot without leaving any sticky residue.
Unfortunately, this didn’t work as well as other brands for my needs. It didn’t curl lashes and was ultimately ineffective.
I tried the ENISECA blow dryer and encountered several issues with the temperature and wind settings. It doesn’t cater to my needs, as the low wind speed corresponds with cold air, and the highest wind speed is too hot for fine hair. It’s not a product I would recommend for those needing precise control over heat and airflow.
This product mixes easily and tastes great with almond milk. I plan to make popsicles with it as well.
These braces provided great support for my daughter, helping her recover from knee pain caused by running.
I have hives triggered by some foods, and these capsules work quickly to alleviate the symptoms. I wish they offered larger quantities.
These come in two sizes, but neither fit properly. They also felt a bit too stiff for me.
This basket is sturdy and holds up well during grocery shopping, though the instructions could be clearer for attaching it to a scooter.
My child accidentally snacked his face with the lanyard, which left a mark. I’m looking for a less stretchy alternative.
This whitening system gradually lightens teeth and works effectively when used as directed. However, improper use could lead to sensitivity and other issues.
I don’t taste this product when I add it to my smoothies, but I believe it’s benefiting my brain health, especially during stressful times.
A great purchase overall. I’m satisfied with this item.
After replacing my 15-year-old Geo Matt, I’m happy with the new one. While it may not last as long, it still feels great, and I’m hopeful it will last for a few years.
The vibrations exceeded my expectations for this smaller-sized product. It’s comfortable, easy to control, and well-packaged. I would buy it again.
These pink ice packs don’t stay cold as long as the blue ones I bought earlier. While they still work, the gel inside seems different, and I’ll stick to the blue ones in the future.
These are a great snack option: low in carbs and high in protein, perfect for when you get the munchies.
The pump for Hibiclens disperses too much liquid at once, making it difficult to use. A foaming dispenser worked better for me.
This item is sturdy, but the adjusting screw interferes with picking up larger items. It’s also a bit too heavy for my wife. The suction cups seem unnecessary.
This negative ion necklace has made a noticeable difference in my energy levels, helping me stay alert. I’m curious to see if there are other benefits over time.
I’m very pleased with this product. It’s lightweight and performs excellently for my needs.
The product has a pleasant feel and appearance, and it is reasonably priced. However, its actual effectiveness is still uncertain.
It’s simple to wear and effectively encourages the correct posture.
I love this holder! It attaches easily to my keychain, keeping my oils accessible at all times.
The product comes in convenient packaging, is easy to carry, and includes three adapters in one. The multi-LED lights are as bright as those used by dental offices. The mouthpiece is comfortable and soft.
You can opt for a smaller model and spend hours trying to irrigate your ear, or choose this larger version and get the job done quickly (just be cautious to avoid injuring yourself).
This is perfect for storing medications and vitamins—securely closes and is easy to refill.
This product is indeed very good.
I absolutely love this! I experience a lot of muscle tension in my shoulders, and this product has really helped me relax. Highly recommend it!
I was eager to try this supplement for immunity, especially during the winter months. The pill size is standard and easy to swallow, with no issues of upset stomach or burping. However, the bottle only lasts 10 days if taken as recommended, which can be quite expensive at $20 per bottle. At the full dosage, you'd be looking at $60 per month, which might not be worth it. While it did help me feel better at a reduced dosage, I would caution against taking it as prescribed.
I really enjoy this product! It works effectively and smells great. It's an essential for my hot yoga practice.
I have delicate skin that tears easily with regular bandages. This one sticks well but is gentle to remove.
Excellent product, delivered just as promised.
Good product overall, though the battery cover is very difficult to remove.
This product blends herbs that really make you feel healthy and revitalized!
I like these flashlights because they are bright, heavy-duty, and well-designed. I purchased eight and keep one in each room for emergencies. I also use rechargeable batteries, making them very convenient.
They work really well, but I’m curious to see how long they will last.
I used this to remove a medium-deep scratch from my Citizen Eco-drive watch. After three to four applications, the scratch was nearly gone, and the rest of the crystal improved significantly! While the process was a bit time-consuming and complicated, it was worth the effort and price.
I’ve used this product before and am reviewing it again in response to an unfairly negative review. I’ve had three units so far, and they’ve all lasted about a year. This model accommodates larger users and retains lubrication well. It’s easy to clean, and although the included scented powder isn’t my preference, it’s useful to prevent bacterial growth.
I like the longer length and the snap closure. Though I prefer the traditional ties over velcro, this product still serves its purpose. The bibs protect my clothes, though they are not very absorbent.
So far, I haven't noticed any significant effects. While the product claims to support libido and boost energy, I haven't seen any changes. I will continue using it as recommended and update my review later.
We order these regularly for our puppy, and they fit great and stay in place!
I’ve tried many diet supplements, and this one seems to be working. While I haven't lost any weight yet, it has stopped my weight from increasing. My energy has improved, and I plan to keep using this product with exercise and better eating habits to hopefully see weight loss soon.
The product seems well-made, but it’s too small to fit my Hoover vacuum cleaner hose properly, leaving a gap.
Yoder’s Apple Cider Vinegar is excellent! I take it in the morning, and it really aids digestion, shrinks my gut, and helps me stay healthier.
I’m really happy with this yoga mat spray. It has a refreshing scent that’s perfect for post-workout cleaning.
I appreciate this company for making it so easy to order through Amazon. The meadowsweet was fresh and nicely cut. I use it in my chicken coop to keep the nest boxes clean and free of pests.
While half of the items arrived damaged, the rest are in great condition and easy to apply!
These socks are decent, but the top is extremely tight on larger calves. While the foot fits well, the tightness around the leg causes discomfort. I’ve resorted to folding the tops down for better comfort.
I received the bottle on June 2, but it had an expiry date of April 2020, which was disappointing.
You're paying for the design, but overall, it's a great mat.
This set of reading glasses was a great value. The glasses are sturdier and better-made than the ones I usually buy at the dollar store. I would definitely recommend these.
This scale has been great. The battery lasted much longer than expected, and I love how it syncs with my Fitbit. The weight tracking has been helpful in identifying trends, especially how lack of sleep can affect weight.
These foam earplugs are easy to use and expand well inside your ears. While they’re fine for moderate noise, I wouldn’t rely on them for very loud sounds. They’re great for sleeping or noise reduction in less extreme environments.
I’m done buying these. They’re average at best and not worth the money.
This product dissolves easily in water, and after a week of use, I’ve noticed a slight improvement in my joints and muscles. Glucosamine takes time to work, but I’m hopeful and plan to order more.
I really like the design of this card keeper.
This multi-purpose cleaner is very effective and has a nice citrus scent. It works well on sinks, tubs, and even refrigerator fingerprints. It’s much less harsh than chemical cleaners.
I didn’t enjoy the smell of this product.
I've been suffering from anemia and decided to try iron tablets. They haven’t caused any stomach discomfort, which is a relief.
This product has significantly increased my alkalinity by 50-150%.
I love the size of these small bags! I use them in my garden to protect seed pods from the wind, ensuring the seeds stay intact.
I’m really impressed with the price and effectiveness of this Camphor spirits product. There’s nothing I dislike about it!
This protein powder tastes great and seems to be a high-quality product. I blended it with water and ice for a quick, filling smoothie.
The scent is amazing, and the material is very thick and high-quality.
It’s labeled as “mini,” but it's much smaller than expected. I was disappointed by the small size considering the high price.
I was never particularly into vitamins, aside from the occasional multivitamin. However, during the pandemic, I began a daily routine of taking Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Zinc every morning, along with an additional Vitamin C dose at night. This large bottle contains 300 tablets, which should last me three months. I usually take all my vitamins on an empty stomach, and so far, I haven't experienced any negative side effects. I believe everyone should incorporate these into their daily regimen to boost the immune system, even if vaccinated. Highly recommended!
I purchased the GermGuardian to tackle the smell from the kitty litter box, which is located in the spare bedroom’s bathroom. For a long time, I struggled to control the odor, but this unit has completely solved the issue. I’ve been running it 24/7, and it eliminates the smell entirely. The spare bedroom is now the freshest room in the house. I plan to get a couple more. I've only had it for about a week, so I can’t comment on its long-term reliability, but I’m hopeful it will last.
These sponges work really well for their price. They exfoliate just the right amount—not too gentle, not too harsh—and lather nicely. They don’t last too long, but at this price, you get what you pay for, which is why there are four in the pack.
Nature’s Benadryl without the side effects! It’s simple and effective. Love it!
I have plantar fasciitis, and these insoles help somewhat. Keep in mind, I’ve had a severe case for 7 years, so they may be more beneficial for someone with a milder condition.
Delicious! I have to keep an eye on my sugar intake, and this is just perfect. I blend it with unsweetened milk, and it tastes like a milkshake with added flavor.
It worked well for me while trimming hedges! It has a pleasant scent and is creamy in texture. I really like it!
Unfortunately, it only removed a small amount of the newest dirt. Despite following the instructions, leaving it for several hours, and repeating the process multiple times, I only managed to remove about 20%. It didn’t do nearly as well as advertised, and I ended up throwing out the rack and the product. This was a $20 waste.
The sponge heads from the store tend to leak like crazy due to a hole in the middle, but these ones don’t. They last about a month with frequent use. While that’s a bit shorter than expected, I love them and will definitely buy them again!
These are super cute, come with long sticks, and work really well! Great value for the price with three boxes.
My husband wears these every night to bed.
This has a lovely cherry almond scent. The moment I opened the box, I immediately recognized it. The lotion absorbs instantly without leaving greasy hands, which I really appreciate. I use it on my dry skin from wearing a knee brace all day, and it makes a huge difference. The pump works well, and the scent lingers lightly throughout the day, especially if I sweat. It reminds me a lot of Aveeno, which I used for years, but this is a great, more affordable alternative.
This package is a great value and will last quite a while.
Quick shipping! I love this toothpaste, though it can be hard to find sometimes. I hope it stays in stock, as I will definitely buy again.
This mushroom supplement is one of the most affordable ones I’ve reviewed lately, priced at $14.99. I like the variety of mushrooms included, especially Chaga, which is great for immune health. Although I can’t say for sure how much Chaga is in this supplement, I purchase it separately in powder form for its health benefits. Overall, I’m happy with this supplement.
This product is excellent.
Very thick and durable. It doesn’t leak even with a lot of liquid.
Never again! This ruined our mattress, even after I added extra elastic to the straps. It left an uneven indentation where the mat was placed and constantly shocked me. I’m so glad we removed it after two years. Never purchasing again.
I’ve never used Argan oil before, always relying on cheaper brands. I applied some to my damp hair, and it didn’t make it greasy at all. My hair looks incredibly shiny and soft.
I ordered these towels from another seller before and received the same brand, so I didn’t expect them to be any different. Unfortunately, these are not the same quality. They lack the authentic coarseness of the genuine towels. I thought I was getting a deal with four towels, but it ended up being a waste of money.
This Hatteker Men’s Electric Shaver is perfect for travel. It’s compact, lightweight, and fits easily into carry-on luggage or a weekend bag. The accessories include a charger and a small cleaning brush. I wouldn’t use it for everyday home use due to its small size, but it delivers a sharp shave with minimal noise. It’s a fun and practical travel companion.
These Reliable 1 Laboratories dissolve in your mouth before you can even take a sip of water. It took me three swallows to wash down the grit. They have no taste, which is nice, but I’m unsure if they actually contain any omeprazole.
I returned this item because there was almost no fragrance. The automatic spray mechanism works well, but the wax itself didn’t meet expectations.
These elderberry gummies are now one of my favorites. They taste great, but what I really like is that they include propolis, echinacea, and vitamin C, without any added zinc, which is nice since so many other supplements contain it. These gummies pack about twice the amount of elderberry as other brands, and I’ve noticed a big difference in my immunity—haven’t been sick at all this cold and flu season.
I broke my first Aromyst diffuser by dropping it. I liked it so much that I bought another one instead of trying a different brand. The black design is sleek, and I like the options for continuous or intermittent mist. I use it every few days and still enjoy it.
This product wasn’t what I expected. If the information about Ormus is correct, it should come in an electromagnetically sealed container, which it didn’t. Under a microscope, I saw little yellow bits that I assume are the gold content, but I’m not sure if this would work as intended. I wish I had spent my money on something more effective, like vitamins.
This is my second time ordering these vitamins. They were recommended by an herbalist I’m working with. I appreciate that they are plant-based. I’ve noticed improvements in my body balance almost immediately. My days are much more stable now. Very pleased!
This mat is excellent for protecting surfaces from heat damage. I set my curling iron to 400 degrees, and the mat shows no signs of wear. It’s flexible, so it’s easy to roll up and store when not in use. I should have bought this years ago.
This is a great buy for vaping. I’ve been using it for over a year with no issues.
I have thick hair, and curling it usually requires a lot of effort. I’ve never found a wand that works well for my hair until this one. It’s essential for my recent cool girl haircut (medium lob). It smooths my hair and provides frizz-free, lasting waves. Very satisfied with this purchase!
This pill box is pretty, but I don’t like that the containers are not attached to each other.
This product uses all the product without absorbing it, which takes a bit more patience and blending. But I love it! I don’t feel dirty after using it.
These cotton swabs are perfect for me due to cauliflower ear. They work very well for my needs.
The package was slightly damaged, but the colognes inside were intact.
This lotion has a smooth texture and doesn’t have any noticeable scent, which works well for my 34-year-old skin. While it’s not quite the same as foundation, it could function similarly to a BB Cream. It doesn’t seem to be waterproof, and it tends to run slightly if I sweat a lot, but this is a common issue with such creams. Overall, I would recommend it. I’m medium-fair in skin tone, and the light shade works fine for me.
I absolutely loved these wipes! I bought a 160-pack two years ago, and I’m just now needing more. Unfortunately, the company that made them is no longer around. I’ll try Kimwipes as a replacement, but these disposable microfiber wipes were amazing for cleaning my glasses.
The silicone is too slippery to effectively hold soap. If you try using it to scrub your back, it’s too soft to exfoliate properly. It feels more like you’re slapping a rubbery surface against your back, and it makes a lot of noise. You can even hear it from another room!
I really love this product – it definitely works as promised.
These are smaller than I expected. I had to attach both pieces together to fit around my leg. The compression seems minimal as well.
Everything is exactly as expected.
My sister uses this to cushion her toes on her injured foot, and she says it works really well. I imagine it could be useful for other purposes too.
I bought these for blessing bags, and they were perfect for the task.
This was an incredible deal! I ended up with multiple types of dishwasher soaps, stain removers, Gain laundry soap, and a full-size Gain scent booster. Plus, I got the full purchase price back in credit for other cleaning products. Well worth the money! I highly recommend this box.
I would rate this zero stars if possible. This egg is terrible. It makes a noise like a smoke detector siren, and it’s poorly constructed with hot glue holding it together. It's not safe to hide anything inside. My visually impaired daughter was scared of it. I would suggest the talking or chirping eggs from other sellers on Amazon instead, and the price is outrageous.
I really like these face mask lanyards. They're perfect for attaching your mask to, and you can easily hang it around your neck when you’re not using it. No more leaving your mask on the desk or worrying about where to put it when eating or driving. You also get four lanyards in this pack, which makes it very convenient. Although they’re on the pricier side, they’re definitely a handy solution.
Great price and improved focus. I’m satisfied with this product.
These capsules are much better than others I’ve used. They close properly every time, and I’ve never had one fall apart, unlike other capsules that spilled everywhere.
I’m returning this product because it doesn’t seem to repel anything. Insects are still coming in, so it didn’t work as expected.
I really love the presentation of this product; it’s perfect as a gift. The scents are nice and not overpowering when dissolved in the bath, and my bathwater was vibrant without any staining. I’m looking forward to using the rest.
The canister looks great on my counter, which is important to me. The product inside provides a good 20g of protein, but the chocolate flavor is a bit ruined by the excess monk fruit extract. Some people might like the sweetness, but I’d prefer a more natural sweetener like organic sugar. Overall, it makes a nice hot cocoa, and I like the lack of plastic scoops and clear labeling.
It’s useful for treating minor cuts, a good item to have on hand for such purposes.
This floss tears easily, especially if you try to reuse it by washing. Not great for that purpose.
I’ve had this table for a couple of years, and while it has some issues like sagging towards the center and one leg slipping, it’s lightweight, easy to clean, and versatile. The lip around the edge keeps items from sliding off, and it’s easy to move around when needed.
Nowhere in the product description does it mention that it’s made in China, which I find problematic. Amazon should be more transparent about where their products come from.
I love this set, the artwork is great and the clipper is amazing as always.
The Reishi mushroom powder gives me an energy boost! It’s a bit bitter, but I can tolerate it when mixed with coffee. I’m willing to put up with the bitterness for the health benefits.
I really like these clippers, but I wish they had a metal bit to clean under the nails. The catcher works well, though it can slide around depending on how you hold the clippers. It’s a good medium size and cuts well.
These are great! The 510 threading is perfectly done, and they fit almost any RDA or RTA. The base is useful for building or storing an atty. I appreciate that these are priced reasonably, and I recommend them for any vaper.
The flavor is great, and it mixes really well. If you prefer protein supplements that aren’t too sweet, this is a great option.
★ free product given for evaluation & review ★ This is a good quality amber glass bottle of pure Moroccan rosewater. The amber glass helps preserve it longer. While the scent is a bit stronger than other brands I’ve used, it’s still pleasant. The spray feels a little heavier on my skin, but it makes it feel soft. Compared to other rosewaters, this one is slightly less delicate, but it’s still a good option for toning.
This battery was supposed to work for my Waterpik SR 3000 toothbrush, but even after replacing it, the toothbrush didn’t respond. Despite soldering the leads correctly, the device wouldn’t charge properly after 24 hours. Replacing the battery didn’t solve the issue.
These pads are fantastic for removing tough residue on cookware and soap scum in the shower. They also work great on palm marks on banisters. They wear out quickly, but they’re the best I’ve found for cleaning almost any surface.
I like these plugs for their discreetness and effectiveness. They help reduce ambient noise, making it easier to hear speech. For the price, they’re a great investment. If you don’t already have good earplugs, I’d recommend investing in a decent pair.
This product arrived quickly. I’ve been taking it as a precaution against glaucoma since it runs in my family, along with diabetes. It seems beneficial, so I plan to continue using it and would likely purchase more once the free supply runs out.
These dryer sheets are great. They don’t have an overpowering scent and clean well. They’re also easy to use, just like traditional dryer sheets, but I appreciate that they come in a smaller, more environmentally friendly package.
These didn’t fit my glasses properly.
It’s a cute idea, but when I received it, some of the letters were coming off. Additionally, some of the letters were straight while others were crooked, which was frustrating. I’ll try to fix them, but I’d prefer not to have to repair something I bought.
This is a great, small tablet that’s easy to swallow and doesn’t leave a nasty aftertaste. It’s a nice addition to my vitamin regimen, and I will continue purchasing it.
This product is great for spring cleaning or major cleaning tasks. It holds up well and is a better deal compared to other similar products. It hasn’t been perfect for mold, but it’s still impressive overall.
The zip lock works well, and I’ll be buying more.
It works well enough. I bought it so I could vape in the car without annoying my wife. Mission accomplished!
These essential oils have the most beautiful natural smells. Just a couple of drops in my diffuser, and it works wonderfully.
The blue color is darker than expected, but it still works well for my glasses. It seems to be well-made.
This is a great invention, and I hope it lasts.
These Pain Relief Patches really heat up as promised!
These files are more suited for buffing rather than fine sanding. They perform effectively for buffing purposes, but may not be as effective when it comes to shaping.
The product doesn't seem as durable or robust as the original TV version. It loses its shape more quickly, though it's priced well. The original lasts much longer. These will still be useful for a while and help with plantar fasciitis. However, I’ll likely stick with the originals moving forward. If the original height is too much for you, these could be a suitable alternative. It seems like a different filler material in the pad. I'd give the originals a solid 5 stars, but these are more of a 4.
The medium size worked well for my smaller arm. It’s good quality and appears to be durable. For the best results, it’s best to use it ahead of time.
I gifted this to my boyfriend as part of a beard grooming kit for Christmas, and he’s absolutely thrilled! He uses it every day with the beard balm I bought, and his beard feels incredibly soft. It’s been a huge improvement. He enjoys the sensation and brushes his beard while we watch TV, finding it very relaxing.
The scrubby side is incredibly soft, and my cats absolutely love it on their delicate faces and necks, especially my older cat!
My first experience with this product left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. The mint flavor is mild and pleasant, with no burning sensations in my mouth or lips. The gel is thick, and I had to squeeze the tube a bit harder than usual, but after brushing for about two minutes and rinsing with just water, my teeth felt bright and clean. I appreciate that it doesn’t leave a gritty aftertaste, and it even brightened my teeth. Overall, a great experience, and I highly recommend it.
Great value for a 6-pack 👍🏽 5 stars ⭐️
The product is of high quality, but the pump mechanism broke at the top after the first use. It’s still functional, but less so. The lotion itself is rich and emollient without being greasy. It has a subtle apple scent that fades quickly.
These lightweight summer socks don’t bind at the top and look great with their ribbed design. They stretch well, making them perfect for people with edema or sensitive skin. My dad’s caregivers asked me to order more for him—I've tried several other brands and materials, and these are the best.
This is very handy for cleaning between toes, and it works well. I hope they make a longer handle version in the future. I bought three and recommend it.
Very quiet yet effective. Definitely worth buying.
I really like these towels. Each roll contains 50 "cloths," with a total of 150 cloths across the three rolls. The exterior design is festive. Starting the roll can be tricky because the first piece is glued tightly, but once I get it off, it’s smooth sailing. I use them to clean counters or parts of my cats' litter boxes. They're strong and reusable. The price feels a bit high at $17.99 ($19.99 minus 10% off), but if they last long and can be reused many times, they may be worth it. The current price comes to about 12 cents per sheet. I would have given 5 stars if they weren’t so expensive, but this might not be an issue for everyone.
I use this to clean and massage my face, and it works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend it.
This is the best product I’ve ever used—no exaggeration.
I’ve been using these for over a year, and at first, I liked them. However, I began experiencing anxiety and shortness of breath, which lasted about three months. A few weeks ago, I ran out of these vitamins, and I didn’t buy a new bottle. Since then, my anxiety has significantly decreased. I haven't changed anything else, so it seems the vitamins may have been the cause.
Great product! I bought it for Halloween and didn’t need this much, but for the price, I’d definitely buy it again.
This scent is nice and reasonably priced. I’ve received compliments from men when I wear it, and they often tell me I smell good. It’s a great value, and I like it.
These worked great for my plant wall. The three designs are cute, but they’re not visible when a plant is inside the ring. I’m using them indoors, so I can’t comment on their outdoor durability. They’re easy to install, and the rings are solid. Some of the hinges were a bit wobbly, but it doesn’t affect the sturdiness. I didn’t use the included wall anchors because they didn’t seem very good. I used drywall anchors I had from other projects instead, which I highly recommend.
The product is as described and comes with clear instructions on the packet. It’s for one-time use and should be used immediately after opening.
I dislike using the dustpan with a broom, as I always have to move it around to catch all the debris. This dustpan, however, is fantastic! It’s on a long pole (two short poles screwed together), has a large capacity, and allows me to get the debris into the trash without much spilling. Very happy with this purchase.
Bought this for my dad, and he finds it easy to use.
I’m glad I received the tissues quickly.
This tea is delicious. I’m not sure if it helped with my IBS, but it tastes great. The only issue is that it has a faint marijuana smell, which is unusual for peppermint tea. Despite the strange smell, it’s definitely worth it.
I purchased this as a replacement for a cracked one, and it fit perfectly and works great.
Previously bought this product.
I don’t know why I keep selecting these odd powders for review. I can’t tell if they have any positive or negative effects, but I assume they’re healthy. I add them to my smoothies and can’t taste them at all.
I bought a set of three bottles from a department store, and there was no noticeable scent whatsoever. It seems like it's just a carrier oil with maybe a drop or two of the named essential oil.
I expected these to be glass bottles, but they turned out to be plastic. They look similar to the dark amber glass bottles I have, and I even interpreted the "4-pound" shipping weight as an indication they were glass. The product description only mentions the sprayers and dropper, with no details about the plastic material. I’m not comfortable using a plastic bottle for something like colloidal silver, as I prefer glass. Unfortunately, this product did not meet my expectations, and I’ll be disposing of it. The long shipping time and restocking fee were also disappointing.
These were incredibly comfortable and I wore them out quickly.
They’re okay, but I need more arch support for better comfort.
There’s no flavor, but the product is easy to use and store. I’ve been feeling stronger, and my belly has flattened out. Hoping it’s a long-term benefit.
This nano geocache is of great quality, with a strong magnet. The rainproof log rolls with metal inserts add good value.
I didn’t notice any difference using these, so for the price, I wouldn’t recommend them.
I love this product! It’s given me an energy boost, and my hair feels nicer. The customer service was excellent. Highly recommend!
Bought this for my family, and they use it regularly. Everyone likes it.
These are well-made but didn’t quite work for my heel spurs at first. After using them with boots and thinner socks, I found them more comfortable. While they squeak a little, they’ve provided me with much-needed relief. I would recommend them!
My husband has pollen sensitivity, and after placing this on his side of the bed, he noticed a clear improvement in air quality.
Excellent product. It smells okay and I absolutely love it!
This is an adequate product for being made in China, but the original cane tips made in the U.S.A. lasted longer.
These work wonderfully for my gym workouts.
This product is effective for pain relief, as long as you follow the practitioner’s directions. It’s safe, as it uses fruit enzymes.
These balloons are good quality. They didn’t have any holes, unlike some others. They hold air well and the pink color is beautiful.
I bought this for the bathroom with the cat litter box. It works great, and we don’t notice the smell anymore.
If mixed in a pitcher of liquid, the taste is masked, but it tastes a bit harsh when diluted in a small amount of water. I take it before bed, and I believe it enhances my sleep.
This tissue packaging is unusual, but I love that it fits in my car’s drink holder. The tissues are sturdy and soft, and the pretty design is a plus. However, the cost is a bit high, though it’s worth it for the convenience.
I love this mustard! It’s so good, and all the varieties are worth the money. You’ll miss it when the jar is gone.
I suffer from joint damage, and this toilet seat booster has been very helpful. It provides a secure fit and makes sitting down and standing up easier. While it’s not as comfortable as my previous model, it’s more durable. I believe it will last for a couple of years.
I’m unsure about the effects of Karela powder, but I add it to my smoothies daily. It blends well and doesn’t affect the taste. The package is small, but if you're interested in it, I think it’s fine.
The product description was misleading. These are meant for high arches, not flat feet. It caused confusion, and the wrong information on the website didn’t help.
These scrubbers are perfect for dishwashing! The sponge and steel scrubber combo work great for different tasks, and they’ve held up well so far.
This product is just as advertised and easy to use. The only downside is that the brass zipper protector leaves a brass smell on your fingers. It’s a good product to keep kids out of medicines, though scissors could cut through it. The vinyl material is thicker than expected, and I’d consider buying it again.
This product works as described. It loosens my pants for the day but doesn’t offer a permanent solution. I should probably just buy new pants instead of relying on this.
Good size and sturdy.
These were poorly cut and took a long time to assemble. The quality is poor, and it looks homemade.
This clip is better than the one that came with my case, but it bends when clipped to anything other than a thin surface. A stronger metal would have prevented this.
This pendant is lovely and well-crafted. The detailing is clear, and it’s comfortable to wear. However, I prefer solid backs for religious jewelry, though this one is still attractive.
This product was a total waste of money. It didn’t work at all.
These socks are incredibly soft and comfortable.
The directions were unclear, and the heating pad didn’t heat up. There were no instructions on where to place it, so I’m disappointed with this product.
I’m allergic to this product, and the smell irritates me.
It’s great to have this box!
I purchased this product to help alleviate my husband's lower back pain. Initially, it seemed fine when applied, but a few minutes later, he complained of a burning sensation, describing it as feeling like lava. We ended up washing some off, which made him feel better. I used a small amount, even less than a pea-sized amount, but the intense heat was still overwhelming. After the initial discomfort, he said the area cooled down and felt soothing, though he felt the intense heat wasn't worth the cooling effect afterward. If you can handle extreme heat, this product might work for you. We have used other products like Sombracream and Icy Hot without issues, but they don't compare to this one. We received this product at a discount for an honest review, and these are my personal opinions.
If you're concerned about arthritis running in your family, it's best to start taking preventive measures before joint deterioration occurs. This supplement is highly effective for joint support, containing potent anti-inflammatory ingredients. It doesn't work immediately, so be patient as it takes time to show results. I highly recommend it. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope the information helps you make a more informed decision.
This product is exactly as I expected.
I struggle with anxiety, and after taking one of these capsules, I immediately felt much more relaxed. I highly recommend it.
The quantity in the package is small, so it might seem expensive, but the taste is quite good. The flavor is similar to almonds, with a slight woody taste. I purchased the "sweet" variety, so it's not a concern to eat them in moderate amounts, but the bitter ones can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. While some health claims are exaggerated, the sweet variety is safe for consumption. The small quantity is the only downside.
This product is sharp and easy to use.
This product is poorly designed. The bottom surface is too hard and lumpy, making it feel like walking on rocks. The hard plastic rollers were uncomfortable, so I removed them, but the remaining plastic posts were equally unpleasant. Not a good design.
This product works effectively! It's potent, so follow the instructions and take it with a substantial meal. Taking it on an empty stomach or with a snack caused me to feel nauseous.
After taking this product for a week, I experienced dry skin and swelling in my thyroid. The only product that worked for me was Vita-Strength. Since returning to Vita, my thyroid swelling and dry skin have improved, and my weight is stabilizing. I cannot recommend this product with confidence.
I noticed a significant improvement in my memory recall after using this product.
The Fitbit Aria scale has all the features you'd expect from a modern scale, but it doesn't do its primary job of providing consistent weight readings well. If you step on the scale multiple times, you'll get different readings each time. The syncing over Wi-Fi with your account is nice, but the inconsistency in weight readings is a major drawback.
Everything was as expected.
The package includes a large, soft mask and a small cloth pouch. The mask fits comfortably and blocks out all light, and even though I can open my eyes underneath it, I can't see anything. It's very comfortable, well-made, and soft. The price of $12.59 is a bit high for just one mask, but if you're purchasing two, the price is much more reasonable. The blue color I received is darker than what is shown on the website.
This is a very good product with great taste!
These make my mouth feel as if I've just left the dentist. No pain, thorough cleaning, and the price is right for four in the package. I highly recommend them. I'm back to buy more!
These are quite soft, and the price is reasonable, but you can find cheaper alternatives from stores like Costco.
This massager is nice, but it occasionally shuts off randomly. Despite that, it gets frequent use.
I appreciate the soft cloth at the brush head; it doesn't scratch the surfaces I use it on. The sizes are just right, and they seem durable. I recommend it.
After changing my diet and lifestyle, I used fish oil supplements, and Gloreyfeel's product is one of my favorites. The capsules are potent, and they don't have the strong fishy taste that others do. Fish oil supports heart health, cholesterol management, and various other health concerns. I recommend this product based on my personal experience.
This is a bit too stiff for my liking.
I enjoyed the ginseng flavor, especially when paired with honey.
Great product, works well, and the price is excellent. I received three tubes instead of one, which is a great deal.
I absolutely love this pipe!
The bags are made from thin plastic, and they feel like they'll tear easily. I bought them for the footprint tissue paper, and while they're cute, the quality isn't great.
This is a good starter kit for those new to Wicca. However, the booklet it comes with has tiny print, and I would have preferred a larger print book. Now, I just need to find a suitable book with large text on beginner Wicca.
After washing several times, the black coloring still wouldn't come out. Also, the socks are way too small.
I have yet to see the claimed benefits, but I've used this product in several dishes. No one has commented on the taste, but I'm cautiously optimistic about the results.
Purchased as a gift.
My kids wear uniforms, and they often come home with stains from the playground or food. I decided to try a stain remover, and I was impressed with how well it worked. After treating their clothes and washing them, 90% of the stains were gone. A second treatment removed the rest. There was a slight baby powder smell, and I had to rinse the clothes extra, but overall, I'm amazed by how well this worked.
This product works normally.
My husband is an avid runner and weightlifter, and he really likes these vitamins for their content.
This brush isn't for detangling your beard; it's for applying beard oil and balm. It does an excellent job of applying the balm, but if you're looking to comb out tangles, this isn't the right brush for the job.
I really enjoy this new flavor! It helps with nausea related to gastroparesis, which I experience.
Energetix products, particularly their homeopathic formulas, have been a huge help for me. I am sensitive to supplements, and Lymph III has been especially beneficial in supporting my lymphatic health. I'm so grateful to have found these products.
This is my go-to non-drug solution for headaches. It works every time!
Just as described and works great.
This massager works well to relieve neck kinks. However, I wish the straps were adjustable, as my longer arms make it uncomfortable to use on my neck. Still, it's worth the money.
Reishi is a popular tonic in Eastern medicine with multiple benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, immunity, and stress management. I like this product because it's organic and sourced from whole foods. Highly recommended.
This product doesn't seem to work any better than other cheaper alternatives. It does reduce pain, but only for a couple of hours, and it doesn't seem to last long. It may be overpriced.
This foam cushion is generic and uncomfortable. It's too short for someone tall like me and doesn't provide proper thigh support. I will return it and consider other options.
This product didn't work as expected, as my glasses still fog up.
This is the best stain remover I've ever used. It completely removed stains from dog urine on my drapes and bedspread. It works on a variety of stains, including coffee and tea.
This product is high-quality, and the activated charcoal has been a great bonus. I use it as a pre-toothpaste and keep it in my emergency medical kit.
The product contains 100mg of COQ10 and 100mg of Vitamin E, both of which have numerous health benefits. I take it daily due to heart issues.
After using this product for a short time, I've noticed my skin has become plumper. I use it with moisturizing cream and rose water spray, and I love the results! I'll definitely repurchase.
These were the perfect Christmas gift for my mom! The fit was great for her slim legs, and the quality met my expectations.
This looks great on my desk at the dealership!
This works great, and the price is the best. Very happy with it.
The spray function is quite difficult to use, requiring both hands for proper aiming, which was disappointing.
Unsure if the product works as described. I was hesitant due to an offer for a free bottle with a review, which made me doubt the authenticity of the feedback. Ended up returning it.
The harness is challenging to strap on, and it seems to be designed with a smaller head in mind, as it was modeled on females.
I've been a fan of Method Cleaning Products for years, using their all-purpose cleaner to reduce chemicals in my home. The scent is pleasant and light, but it doesn't do as well on water drip marks on my fridge. However, it works great for everyday touch-ups on my stove and dishwasher.
This product works well for unwanted odors, especially dark air. It's in a large jar and has a mild formula that is gentle on sensitive skin.
These pads outperform others by a significant margin. They effectively absorb liquid, making my life much easier compared to using regular paper towels. Highly recommended.
Simply the best! Absolutely fantastic!
On the farm, these gloves are perfect for all kinds of dirty jobs, from the kitchen to the barn. They fit well, offer great protection, and are durable enough for long-lasting use.
I've been using this painless eyebrow and facial hair trimmer regularly, and I love it! It’s simple to use and doesn’t hurt, removing hair quickly and effectively.
The lid wasn’t sealed properly, and water droplets spilled everywhere when I tried to clean it. However, the translucence is helpful for seeing the volume without needing to open it.
The taste was so unpleasant that I couldn’t keep it down. I tried it multiple times but ended up with heartburn and nausea each time.
I was expecting an original German product, but this one came from Eastern Europe. The packaging wasn't in a language I could read, and the price seemed too high for what I received. Not sure if it performs the same way as the original.
These work wonderfully on my back for fibromyalgia. It's hard to find alternatives with heat instead of lidocaine, but this one is effective.
A great collection of free items! The Finish products cleaned my dishes well, and Gain made my laundry smell amazing. Wisk also worked wonders for my laundry.
This foot tool is by far one of the best I've used for pedicures. It’s a must-have!
I bought this to drown out my husband’s snoring and other noises at night. While it doesn't completely block snoring, it does reduce outside noise, helping me sleep better. It's compact and fits perfectly on my nightstand.
After using this brush for two months, I’m disappointed. The shedding continues daily, and it doesn’t seem to hold up well. I’m switching to a different brush, though I appreciate the seller’s excellent communication.
These are fantastic! I would buy them again without hesitation. Comfortable and stylish, Scojo nails it!
These probiotics are worth the price. They're easy to take and don’t have any taste. I add them to my morning drink.
These mask brackets are great for making masks more comfortable to wear. They keep the mask off your mouth, making breathing easier, and they're easy to clean. A must-have for anyone who struggles with mask discomfort.
While this product didn’t increase my milk supply, I continue to take it for overall health. It's a great price for a good product.
The product broke after just one week of use.
I haven’t used it for long, but the strength and ingredients are just what I was looking for.
I love these B12 gummies! They’ve helped boost my energy, and the taste makes it easy to stick to my vitamin routine. I’m really happy with them.
I didn’t try it myself, but I got it for my brother-in-law because he loves it. He’s very picky about his diet, so I’m sure it’s a great product.
I just received this product today and have already used it twice. It feels amazing – a strong massage without being overwhelming, and the heat is just right. I’m in love with this little device.
These gloves are adorable, with pink fingertips, and they fit well and are comfortable. However, the unflocked pair lacks puncture resistance, and my fingernails tore through them. The flocked pair offers better durability, but I prefer the feel of the unflocked ones.
These protein bars are tasty, and it’s hard to decide which flavor is the best.
Great options for a quick, tasty lunch when you're not too hungry, with no chalky protein taste.
It's okay, but the rods are too short, making it uncomfortable to use. It also came in an unnecessarily large box, which was wasteful.
Not used as intended, but when I tried to re-pierce my ear, it wasn’t sharp enough. One of my ears is still sore after three weeks, though not infected.
The order arrived with missing parts, and the hookah didn’t come with cleaning supplies. The glass base was also loose, which was disappointing.
The product was the right size to be cut down for an exact fit.
These work excellently for everything listed on the package. No need for additional cleaners, making them a great choice for individuals with allergies!
The fit around the belt is great. The only downside is the smell, but once you get past it, it's definitely worth having in your BMW.
After struggling with stomach issues, I decided to give this a try. I mixed it with some Dasani water enhancer in 14 cups of water, and the taste was quite pleasant. I’ll continue using it and update on its effectiveness.
I had higher expectations for this disposable cup. While it has a nice black color, it feels flimsy, and I wouldn’t order it again.
I’ve been using Zim’s for 20 years for dry, cracked skin, and it's the only product that works for me. I’ve tried other remedies like Vaseline and coconut oil, but nothing compares to Zim’s.
The cover fits well, allowing me to wear the Phonak under my shirt and protect it from moisture. My only complaint is that you have to pull the cover back to insert the charging cord, but that’s a minor inconvenience.
This supplement contains D3, known as the "sun vitamin," which is beneficial for bone health. Although too much sun can be harmful, D3 helps with calcium absorption. I take 10,000 mg of D3 and also appreciate the K2-MK7 to help direct calcium to bones and teeth. However, the presence of K1 concerns me, especially for those on blood thinners. Consult a doctor before use.
The way these arrived was disappointing. They were bent and looked like they had been sitting in storage for too long. I’ll update this review once I know how they taste.
It’s very easy to use and works well. The recharging is quick, and it lasts for multiple uses before needing to be recharged. I'm happy with it.
This oil is incredible. I blend various oils together to create my own facial moisturizer, and this one works wonderfully.
This silk face mask feels soft against my skin and does an excellent job of blocking out light due to its adjustable lower strap. The materials and craftsmanship are top-notch.
It worked well for the first couple of uses, but now it’s dull and doesn’t perform as expected. It feels like a waste of money.
This product is great for the neck and head. It’s still working well after a year, though it’s a bit noisy.
If you have a teenager, this is a much more affordable option compared to acne creams.
I purchased this in September, and it worked well for about two weeks, but after that, the bulb’s brightness decreased, and a blackish film formed inside. The replacement lasted only 7 days before the same issue occurred. It’s frustrating, and I believe these bulbs may be from a defective batch.
A friend recommended this product to curb my snacking, and it’s worked wonders. I’ve lost weight and dropped several jean sizes, so I’m definitely seeing results.
My dog suffers from flea allergies, and this product has been a big help, even though I’m not a fan of the cedar smell. No more tick bites this year!
My grandmother swears by this for her frequent charlie horses. It’s the ninth bottle I’ve bought for her, and it works well with minimal scent despite its potent ingredients.
This helps curb my appetite, which has been really beneficial.
The product arrived on time and as described. However, the texture is quite rough, and it didn’t soften with use as I expected. I wouldn’t purchase it again.
The edges are a bit rough.
Unfortunately, this didn’t help me sleep.
I appreciate the variety of mushrooms included in this supplement, especially Chaga, which I know is great for immunity. Overall, this product is highly beneficial to health, and I find no issues with it.
These are excellent for anyone who suffers from frequent nasal issues due to allergies. They work great for blowing your nose.
These have significantly improved my allergies, and I’ll definitely be ordering more.
I don’t normally leave reviews, but after seeing how well this worked for my wife’s knee pain and my own shoulder injury, I wanted to share. It provided relief for hours without needing to resort to medication.
This teeth whitening set includes a whitening pen and desensitizing serum, which is great for sensitive teeth like mine. The strips stick well, and the cooling effect is pleasant. I was confused about how often to apply them, as the instructions suggest a full 14-day treatment.
I took these while breastfeeding my daughter, who had severe reflux. Within 24 hours, I saw significant improvement in her condition, and it also helped me with abdominal cramps and reflux.
I had high hopes for this device, but it’s complicated and not user-friendly, especially for seniors. The setup and operation are challenging, and while it has some functionality, it’s not worth the price. There are better, cheaper alternatives out there.
These shears are great, though they appear more neon greenish-yellow than the picture shows.
I’ve been using this product for years, but recently it caused a burning sensation on my skin after using it with my contact lenses. I’m looking for a safer alternative.
This product works but has a terrible taste. I recommend mixing it with a bit of water and chasing it with something more palatable, like peanut butter.
These filters fit perfectly in my cloth masks, helping to block out allergens without fogging up my glasses. I’m waiting for a restock to purchase more.
I love this back scrubber, which I use not only for my back but also for my legs and feet. Highly recommended for anyone who isn’t as flexible as they used to be.
I used to constantly lose my glasses while working. Now, with this set of three different colored glasses holders, I never have to worry about losing them again.
This domestic stain remover is just as effective as the commercial version used in dry cleaners. It removes all types of stains and works great when soaked in hot water. I saved money by using it instead of replacing a stained cotton shower curtain.
This is a straightforward moisturizer that absorbs effortlessly and leaves the skin feeling hydrated. It’s great for mixing with Cicaplast to care for mature skin and promote healing for minor acne overnight. This product can also double as an eye and neck cream. It comes in a generous tube and is fragrance-free, offering a clean and efficient solution.
It blends smoothly with a mild flavor. I initially used it in smoothies, but after realizing it doesn’t have an overpowering taste, I began using it to make protein pancakes, which I freeze for convenience.
The facial scrub combines cacao nibs with a hydrating mask. However, the nibs are too large and can be uncomfortable, almost like rubbing stones on your face. The hydrating mask, on the other hand, feels great, but the size of the nibs is hard to overlook.
While I can't speak to its full effectiveness due to being nursing, I didn't realize it wasn't recommended during this time. That said, my picky eater son seems to benefit from it, and my sister has reported it helping her stomach. I've also noticed less constipation in my son. For its benefits, the price is reasonable.
I already own the lower leg protector and can confirm it’s an excellent product that keeps your cast or dressing dry. I purchased this arm version, which is identical to the lower leg protector. If you need protection for your hand, wrist, or elbow, this is a great choice.
These are quite filling.
My experience with this wasn’t pleasant. My partner was on a keto diet and developed gout after eating only meat. I use this to help break down uric acid, as I consume a lot of protein, and have stayed gout-free. Staying hydrated and using supplements like this has been beneficial.
These fit well and reduce noise, though they also muffle sounds you want to hear. They provide noise reduction rather than full hearing protection.
Does this product work? Yes, I believe it does. It might be partly a placebo effect, but I felt some benefits. It’s a small investment, and I think that such products can’t hurt and might indeed help. Everyone’s body is different, so I hope this helps you on your health journey.
I’ve bought this twice. The first bag was very clumpy, but the second bag had fewer clumps, likely fresher. I used this daily as a poultice for about six weeks, and my 9mm displaced fracture healed within seven weeks. I also used symphytum in water daily. It’s a great product, though a bit clumpy.
This sugar bowl is cute and compact, fitting into small spaces while still looking nice. The spoon is small, but the perfect size for its purpose.
This bottle offers a solid dose with over 400mg of Saw Palmetto and 2.5 Elderberry. It’s easy to take once a day as recommended. The clear bottle is a convenient feature, allowing you to monitor how much is left. There are no fillers, and it’s easy to swallow with liquid. I trust this review is helpful to you.
These sticks seem to be made from a root-like material. I didn’t enjoy the taste or smell, but they effectively clean teeth, especially the front ones. I struggled to use them on the back teeth, though. These sticks are useful for both humans and pets; my dogs chewed them happily, and they helped clean their teeth!
This is a fantastic oil! I add it to my coffee every morning and enjoy the results.
We’ve been using Dreft for tough stains and are very pleased with how well it works on everyone’s clothes, especially when paired with their detergent.
Despite its odd cheese-like smell, this product provides the essential butyric acid that older individuals can become deficient in.
This is a great product, offering excellent value.
No side effects to report. It’s not too large and has a neutral taste. The high-quality ingredients provide excellent nutritional support.
This product is ideal for making e-juice. It came in a sealed, sturdy bottle and has a slightly sweet taste. I’ll definitely be purchasing more.
This is a plant-based protein blend with anti-inflammatory ingredients like tart cherry and turmeric, which is low in net carbs—perfect for keto or diabetic diets. The vanilla cold brew flavor is delicious! It makes a great post-workout recovery drink, and I highly recommend it.
This DVD offers a 30-day body transformation with strength training, cardio, and nutritional advice. The Lewandowski brothers present the content with humor, but their approach may be more appealing to a male audience. The exercises are more geared towards upper body muscle groups, with an emphasis on the back and biceps. While this could work for men seeking a straightforward approach, it might not be suitable for everyone.
It occasionally fails to take a reading, but after using it for a few days with confirmed ketosis, I find it to be mostly accurate. Sometimes you need to try again, but for the price, it’s a good deal!
This is a thoughtful and well-made product. I received a unique lionstone crystal, which I love—it’s like a more solid version of tiger’s eye with a beautiful shifting gold layer. The whole set is delightful, though I wish the stones were identified. The bags are cute, making this purchase a pleasant experience.
The top strap is too small to fit over my head, making the brace unusable. I’ll keep it for the extenders and filters, but the brace doesn’t work for me.
The bottle lid was broken upon arrival, but the product itself is good.
These are soft and clean well, making them perfect for brushing my infant son’s teeth. He enjoys chewing on them as well.
I use two bags to get a stronger flavor. This tea works well in an infuser, and I plan to continue drinking it.
This is an essential item for me—it hits all the right spots. I’m a bit snarky, but I love it!
I carry the flat piece in my purse for use under my eyes when dealing with puffiness due to allergies or urban pollution. It helped my fiancé during his coffee withdrawal as well.
I mix this with Kodiak mix and find it to be a delicious addition.
I wouldn’t use this body brush in the shower, as I fear it may lose bristles when wet. However, it’s excellent for dry brushing! The handle provides a good grip, and it’s long enough to reach your back and feet. Dry brushing offers numerous health benefits and is effective for exfoliation, making this brush a great tool.
The magnets fell out after a few weeks, but they did provide relief for the soles.
The product was cheap and of poor quality. It didn’t fit my vintage tub faucet and broke when I attempted to replace the connector.
This is my fourth walker, and it’s the easiest to maneuver with one hand due to its lighter weight and smaller wheels. It’s great for indoor use and folds up easily. I recommend it.
The product arrived on time and as described.
The quality is good, and the product looks just like the photo provided.
I’ve been using this for nearly 10 years and still love it. The only downside is the price, which feels a bit high for the small amount you get.
Tart cherries are known to ease inflammation, aid muscle recovery, and help with sleep. I prefer nutraceuticals over pharmaceuticals. These capsules are easy to swallow, and although I haven’t noticed much difference, my mother and brother have seen improvements in their conditions. They’ve stopped relying on Advil, and I find these capsules an affordable alternative to tart cherry juice.
This collagen protein powder is fantastic! My wife blends it into her coffee, and she barely notices the taste. It dissolves completely without any lumps. There’s a slight smell when you first open the container, but it’s not overpowering.
These fit perfectly and provide the right level of compression. The color and design are appealing, and they hold up well after washing.
In terms of quality, these are slightly below Foster Grant folding glasses but still a solid choice.
As a first-time user, it took a little time to figure out how to assemble them. After making some adjustments, I found them effective in relieving my neck pain.
These bleach tablets are fantastic for multitasking. I no longer need to carry around a heavy bleach bottle. It’s great to find them again after Walmark ran out during the pandemic.
I absolutely adore the variety of scents in this large set! They all smell wonderful and work perfectly in my diffusers, leaving my home smelling amazing!
This product is the best I've tried. I compared it to megsorb and others, but nothing beats this one.
It's soothing and provides long-lasting relief. The scent matches my expectations perfectly.
A great way to get vitamin C without the corn-based ingredients found in other products.
They work effectively, easily cutting through a penny and providing quick access. The black paint may wear off, but they're affordable, stylish, and functional. I feel confident using them on the job.
I have mixed feelings about this product. I usually love Perlier, but this Honey Liguria scent is subtle. While the bath cream leaves skin soft and smooth, I’m tempted to return it because it lacks a strong scent.
These tissues are my go-to. The cube box design is superior to the rectangular ones, and they are soft yet durable without being too flashy.
It looks exactly like the image and description. No complaints with the container, it’s perfect.
Despite being labeled to fit size 10 (which is my size), these were too tight and uncomfortable, so I didn’t use them. They feel cheaply made, and Dr. Scholls could have designed something better.
I purchased this for joint pain relief but later discovered it’s not suitable for me since I’m on blood thinners. Make sure to consult with your doctor before using.
I did this on a day with varied sun exposure—back windows were hot, and the crystals showed up much faster. For better results, try heating the window beforehand in cooler weather. Avoid overdoing it; applying multiple coats in stages works best for an even finish. Using cardboard or masking tape around window edges prevents a messy overspray. The frosted look is fantastic for privacy and looks very classy!
I bought this scooter for a sprained ankle as a substitute for crutches. It was an affordable option with next-day delivery and a metal basket, which is a bonus. It works great and will likely be used by my family for many years.
I’m very satisfied with my purchase.
The first time I bought this, it tasted wonderful. However, the second batch had a terrible taste, resembling old medicine instead of cinnamon. I won’t purchase again until the formula returns to the original flavor.
These work great.
I’m happy with the product.
They work fine, though I didn’t end up using them.
They’re too small and easily topple over.
I love pampering myself with pedicures, but this spa bath didn’t even turn on after setting it up.
The price for this hydrated water is unbeatable! Buying it in-store is more expensive, and this delivery option saves me both money and time. I’m definitely purchasing again.
I’m not too familiar with myrrh, but this brand of oil is great! It lasts a good amount of time in my diffuser and the fragrance is pleasant. I paired it with frankincense, and it worked wonderfully.
These are completely ineffective. I expected them to foam up like others I’ve tried, but they don’t clean or eliminate odors at all.
These work amazingly well. Despite their small size, they pack a lot of power. I use larger models in other rooms, but these are perfect for bathrooms.
Placed in a low-airflow area, this unit has reduced pollen and dust. I no longer need to clean my black glass furniture as often.
I liked the unit initially, but one of the wheels became wobbly after minimal use because the bearings broke. I returned it for a refund.
These are the best nail files, in my opinion. They're compact and fit into any purse, travel bag, or luggage. I always have one with me, and they leave my nails smooth and shiny.
You get a lot of tissue boxes for the price—more than I expected!
These are not recommended. The design is helpful for those with hand issues, but the materials do not hold up well. I’ve bought them twice. The first pair lasted around a year and a half before the plastic shaft broke. I replaced them, but the second pair only lasted four months before breaking in the same spot.
Several of the capsules were stuck together, and there were more clumped than I expected.
My husband didn’t use this for a balding scalp; he tried it for his face and nose/ear hair. Here’s his take: It’s a good shaver with various easy-to-change attachments. The shave was close and smooth, easily gliding over the contours of his face. It was one of the best shaves he’s had in years. Plus, the nose trimmer worked painlessly. A solid value for the price.
Very nice!
After severe flooding and eczema from mold treatment chemicals in LA, I tried several natural remedies without success. But after two days of applying this five times a day, my skin improved dramatically—itching, blisters, dryness, and inflammation cleared up almost entirely. I wish I had discovered this earlier. It worked where other treatments didn’t.
I was drawn in by the claims of noise-blocking and great reviews, but for me, they didn’t work. I followed the instructions, but the earplugs wouldn’t stay in my ears, even after trying for a while. They didn’t live up to expectations.
Recommended by an ND for a one-time skin inflammation. It worked decently.
Don’t waste your money.
I really enjoy this tea; it curbs my appetite effectively.
It’s been a game changer, especially at work. My focus is much better, and my mood stays balanced, which helps a lot during hormone spikes.
These earplugs didn’t block any noise. I tried inserting them in various ways and followed the instructions carefully. Unfortunately, they didn’t work at all.
I liked the results it provided.
I’m always looking for new natural supplements for my green smoothies. This one caught my eye. The powder is green, comes in a resealable foil package, and has a scoop for easy measurement. The smell is minimal, and the taste is a bit like gooseberries without being overly tart. It mixes well into smoothies without overpowering the taste. It provides a nice, mild vitamin C boost, but not enough to replace medicinal doses. Overall, I’ve been enjoying it for several weeks.
These inserts worked well in my slip-on shoes. They were easy to trim to size and fit perfectly. After walking in them for a couple of hours, they molded to my feet and became very comfortable. They’re holding up great so far.
Bought these to keep mice away around the house.
The Yoda design is cute, just like the pictures, but it doesn’t stay on well. Also, toothpaste tends to get clogged and crusty inside.
I absolutely love this set! The colorful filers are fun and easy to grip. The glass file is especially unique and works wonderfully. Excellent value for the price!
This product is as potent as advertised. I love the energy boost it provides—exactly what I needed!
These soft earplugs worked wonders on my recent airplane flight. They blocked out engine noise and a crying baby. I prefer these over the squishy kind because they’re more comfortable and easy to remove with the tab. The carrying case is convenient for storage.
I was given this product to test and provide feedback. So far, it feels good to use, especially for improving circulation, which I need after numerous surgeries. It glides along the skin well, and the round roller is useful for specific areas. A handle with a softer grip might improve the design, but I like the concept. I’ll update this review with more details as I continue to use it.
These are perfect for keeping produce fresh. I wouldn’t want to be without them.
I buy these for myself, not for kids. I really enjoy them.
This is my new go-to daily vitamin. It’s vegan, easy to swallow, and covers all the requirements for my 60+ body. I tend to skip breakfast, and this vitamin is gentle on my empty stomach, with no aftertaste or discomfort. It’s also cheaper than my usual Centrum, so I’m sticking with this one. Highly recommend for anyone over 40 who cares about their health!
My sister has severe peripheral neuropathy in her feet. They burn and then go numb. I gave her this to try, but I’m not sure if she’s using it yet. She’s in so much pain that she actually asked for suggestions—fingers crossed it helps.
A waste of money for me. I regretted this purchase. The scratch-off was already lifted when I got it.
These were bought as an emergency fix. They worked in a pinch, but the hand rests aren’t palm-friendly and were uncomfortable for my son. People using forearm crutches long-term need curved hand rests for better comfort. They were affordable, and the delivery was fast.
This pet pill syringe makes giving medication much easier. One of my dogs loves the pocket treats, but the other used to spit out pills no matter what. With this syringe, we can get the pills down in one try. It even lets you add water with the pill, which seems to help prevent spitting. This is a great addition to our routine.
I bought this scale for around a year, and it worked decently at first. However, after about a year, the weight readings started to fluctuate. I replaced the batteries, but that didn’t help. I’m now switching to a higher-rated scale. However, the company reached out to me after my review and offered a full refund, which was a pleasant surprise. They’re even offering a replacement, which I appreciate.
These cobalt blue bottles are gorgeous! I tried to replace the roller with a metal one, but it didn’t work until I swapped out the entire plastic hub. Once I did that, it worked perfectly. I love these bottles!
The scent is nice, but it doesn’t work as well as other detanglers I’ve used.
The top cover doesn’t fully cover the compartment, so supplies fall out. I’ve had better medicine bags and had to switch back to my old one.
This is a great way to add more greens to your diet. The powder mixes easily into any liquid, and it’s versatile enough for baking or adding to sauces. I highly recommend it!
This was a hit at the party!
I just received this, and although I haven’t tried it on yet, I can already tell I made a great choice. If you need a head strap for plastic frames that slide down your nose, this is perfect! It’s lightweight and comfortable, even with my hearing aids. The strap is discreet and fits low on the neck. While the only color available is black, it’s so functional that it’s easy to overlook. Worth every penny.
My boyfriend and I are impressed with these lilac heating and cooling wraps. They heat up well in the microwave and are soothing for the neck, shoulders, or legs. They also work as cold wraps if you chill them in the fridge. They’re heavy, made of clay beads and millet, and while you can’t wash them, they’re very effective. For the price, they’re a great deal.
Didn't work for me—maybe it’s just me.
Don't waste your money. There’s no difference between this one and the cheaper version. It’s too loud, and the vibrations are so strong that the attachments keep falling off. The intensity isn’t impressive either. Save your money and buy a better model.
I’ve always wanted to try coconut oil and activated charcoal for my teeth, but I have a sensitive gag reflex. This product worked great—no gagging, and it helped brighten my teeth and leave them feeling fresh.
After a few nights of using this, I developed a headache.
My boys love these brushes. They enjoy picking a new color each night.
I use Dr. B. Dental Solutions Ultrasonic Cleaner every night, and I’m very happy with it.
I bought several of these as gifts. They’re unobtrusive but provide a great reminder. I love that they won’t keep going off because there’s no off button—it’s a great feature.
This was a gift for our Godson, and he loved it. The whole family had fun playing the game.
This works great. I usually buy just the eyebrow shaver, but this has more attachments and a USB charger. Glad I made the purchase!
This is a good, basic mask. If you want more decoration, you can add post earrings, like I do.
The product was exactly as expected, but the order didn’t include the pump, as described.
I’ve been dealing with neck pain for quite a while, so I was hopeful this product would help. Unfortunately, it didn’t work for me at all. I even asked my wife to try it, but she also found it ineffective. After several attempts, I felt it didn't provide any relief. Sadly, I would consider this a poor investment.
We had a serious pantry moth problem and had to discard a lot of food. These smell-proof bags have been a great help in preventing further damage to the remaining items. They’re well-made and seem to be doing their job, especially since we haven’t spotted any more moths. So far, they’re proving to be a solid investment.
Poor quality and a complete waste of money. I wouldn’t recommend it.
These are lightweight yet provide excellent support, making your legs feel comfortable and relaxed.
I take a small amount of this powder daily for Joint Hypermobility Syndrome. It’s easy to mix with water, and I barely notice the taste. My rheumatologist recommended it over pills, and it’s working well for me.
I’m thrilled with my new tongue scraper! It’s been incredibly effective at reducing the buildup on my tongue, which I’d been struggling with for a while. It’s a great addition to my oral care routine!
These are comfortable enough, but the padding is too thin to provide adequate protection. They feel cheap from the start, and the padding compresses quickly. Even when I tried folding them to make them thicker, they didn’t work as expected. I’ll keep looking for something better.
I was concerned these wouldn’t fit my OCedar spin mop, but they do! They’re a great, affordable alternative, though you have to press them down hard to get them to stay in place. Still, they do the job and are a solid substitute.
After spending a hefty amount on a podiatrist visit to deal with an ingrown toenail, I was pleasantly surprised by these clippers. They easily handled my thick toenail, and the set is convenient for storage and travel. I’m hopeful that they’ll help manage my ingrown nails moving forward.
These work as advertised. They arrived quickly, and having a good quantity will come in handy.
These brushes do a fantastic job at exfoliating my skin, leaving it soft and smooth. The gripper knob makes them even better, and they arrived promptly. Definitely a good purchase.
I had high hopes after reading good reviews, but this product disappointed me. I used it to clean my car, and it left greasy, shiny marks all over. I had to go back to my usual product to fix it. Wouldn’t recommend it.
Bought this as a Christmas gift, and it came with an extra bulb. I’m hoping it works as well as the reviews suggest when placed next to a cat box.
I’ve tried several brushes, and this one ranks highly for me. It’s solidly built, with a nice heavy handle and rope for hanging. The massaging side isn’t really my thing, but overall, it’s a good product for the price.
These gummies are a great way to boost immunity. They taste good, aren’t overly sweet, and are easy to chew. I bought the two-pack so our whole family can benefit from them.
I’ve noticed a big improvement in my sleep since using this product. It helps me fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the night, which has always been a challenge for me.
I can’t get enough of these sponges! They’ve made cleaning so much easier and faster, allowing me to tackle multiple chores with minimal effort. My kitchen has never been cleaner!
These masks are a great choice for various weather conditions, such as fog, snow, and dust. They cover my face well, and the comfortable ear loops and adjustable nose piece make them a practical option. The price was great too.
I was disappointed by this candle. The smell from the wick was unpleasant, and it didn’t compare to the clean-burning soy candles I’m used to. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer a fresher, more natural scent.
These are good when used quickly, but mine dried out within a couple of days. Not the most reliable.
This product works great for parties, especially if you still want to hear the people around you while enjoying music. It performs as expected.
This VG is of good quality, providing a nice, flavorless base for vapers or those making their own juices.
The tissues work fine for basic cleaning tasks, like wiping food off counters or cleaning faces. However, the packaging is a bit inconvenient as it’s hard to pull a single tissue without tearing several.
These are very comfortable and easy to wear, and I use them almost daily.
When I can’t use sage, this product is a great alternative. It has a lovely scent as well.
As a family, we rely on supplements for immunity, especially with young children. This tincture has been fantastic in preventing illness. I’ve noticed fewer colds when I take it regularly, and it helps stop symptoms in their tracks.
This product is the perfect size to fit in my purse, and the design is exactly as advertised. I’m very pleased with my purchase.
My hair looks fantastic when I use this tool, though the button placement can be a bit annoying as I often change the temperature by accident. It does get very hot, so be cautious around children.
This works better than the waxed king, getting particles out more effectively.
The lining of this product really makes a noticeable difference in its performance.
A great product at a reasonable price, delivered quickly.
I’ve bought several microfiber towels, and this one is fine for packing on trips. However, it’s thinner and less absorbent than others I’ve used, which feels like a downgrade in quality.
Received two batteries, and both are working fine.
I tried installing this holder, but the clips broke off immediately. The hard plastic is too rigid and doesn’t provide enough flexibility for easy installation.
I bought the OvaCue Wireless Fertility Monitor for my daughter, and it’s been a game-changer for her. It’s easy to set up, provides accurate results, and is a great alternative to other methods that haven’t worked for her. Highly recommended for those struggling with regular cycles or fertility challenges.
Exceeded my expectations.
The wax performed well, leaving my daughter's red Mustang with a glossy shine.
Used it once, and it worked fine.
The packaging is elegant, though the box is a bit large for the lotion bottle. The lotion has almost no scent, which is expected. Its consistency is just right—not too thick or too thin—and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. The pump is sturdy and features a cute leaf design.
I prefer these containers to resealable bags, which sometimes fail to reseal. They're easier to scoop from, and the included measuring spoon is a nice touch. The powder has a good quality and a distinct Irish moss flavor. I wish it came in a larger size, though I’m not sure if it’s available.
Great fit, excellent price, and fast delivery.
Bought these for my husband. They provide a secure grip and are easy to hold. I appreciate the larger clip area, as toenails are generally bigger than fingernails. They feel durable and sharp, promising longevity. Delivery was quick, thanks to Prime.
I use essential oils in my diffuser, and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect. It’s also great for making body butters or lotions. The fragrance is clean and masculine, reminiscent of quality soap. I use 3-5 drops depending on my diffuser size, and the aroma is delightful. At $15.99 for a 3.38 oz bottle, it’s a good value at under $5 per ounce.
My daughters loved these bath bombs. They were well-packaged, with no chips or breaks. The scent and color are subtle, which is reassuring, especially when it comes to the potential impact of harsh soaps and dyes. They're not as luxurious as some brands but still work well and look nice.
Despite all the technological advancements, I'm surprised that Optimum’s products still taste unpleasant—chalky and bitter.
This product works like a miracle. I use it for cuts, burns, and blemishes, and it promotes fast healing.
I use this as a toner at night and sometimes as a makeup remover (though I don't wear much makeup). I plan on purchasing it regularly.
The lotion does everything it claims—it keeps bugs away and provides excellent sun protection. Avon did a great job with this product, including the pump spray and aerosol can. I’ll definitely buy it again when needed.
I wanted to like this due to its price, but it’s too harsh for trimming my beard. Compared to the Redington brand, I won’t be able to use it, so I’m returning it.
It may taste a little bitter, but hey, not everything that's good for you is exactly what you want.
The tattoo looked great and lasted several days, even with showers. I would consider purchasing it again.
As my husband and I age, we understand why our parents were frustrated by unwanted hair in unexpected places. This rechargeable tool came well-packaged and works effectively, with various attachments. It trims safely, which is crucial for nose and ear hair. It did exactly what I expected.
Effectively removes odors and has a pleasant fragrance.
A solid product, though the packaging makes it challenging to scoop the bottom third. I ended up using my own scoop because the provided one was too small. Also, labeling this as a wheatgrass shot is misleading, as it's not pure juice but dehydrated grass mixed with water.
Cute Halloween decorations with a variety of items. They’ll be fun to use when Halloween approaches. My kids will enjoy them.
I really appreciate this product! I need these gloves for limited shopping trips and other activities, like paying bills at the Post Office. Thanks to Amazon for listing this item.
This is my second unit after my daughter took the first one. It feels great on sore muscles.
Puffs with Lotion tissues are soft and comforting, and I find it convenient to have them delivered to my door. It's always helpful to have tissues on hand when dealing with a cold or flu.
This item is large, and I’m disappointed because the hinge is poorly made and doesn’t line up well. The quality isn’t as good as advertised, and it feels like it could fall apart easily. Sending it back.
One of the letters had a hole in it upon arrival. We had to tape it to keep it inflated.
A great purchase at an unbeatable price for the quantity.
I’ve been using these supplements for years, and I’ve never felt better!
These gummy vitamin C supplements are excellent, especially with the addition of bioflavonoids. Although I don’t like the amount of vitamin C per gummy (you need to take four to match one pack of Emergen-C), they taste great and are a good option for kids.
A nice purchase. I wear glasses, so the light is a bit harsh on my eyes, but I plan to gift it to my niece.
After trying many remedies for my heels, this one stands out as the best. It works wonderfully. Highly recommend.
This product is great for removing hard water stains from toilet bowls. It’s the only thing that works on our toilet’s hard water buildup.
I had hoped this product would help, but after three weeks of use, I experienced only soreness without any improvement. It didn't change anything, so I stopped using it.
I ordered this in pink, but the color is more of a hot pink than the dusty rose shown. My only issue is the adhesive sensitivity, which is common for me with K tape, but otherwise, it's useful for wrist strains and magnet therapy. The peel-off grid on the back is convenient.
A good product at a great price. Fits my electric toothbrush perfectly.
I bought this as a footrest for my desk, but it didn’t work as I expected. The foam compresses too quickly, making it ineffective for its intended purpose. However, I repurposed it as lumbar support for my chair, and it works fine for that.
After reading several reviews, I found this product to be excellent. Pros: lightweight, quiet, and smooth cutting. Cons: none.
A lifetime supply of nasal relief packets. Add them to your Neti pot with distilled water for sinus relief—perfect for sinus infections or bad allergies.
These work great for cleaning after the California fires. They’re non-toxic and effectively remove soot and ash damage.
I really like these bags. They're large, clear, and multi-purpose, perfect for storing comforters and more.
Great product! I’ll definitely order this shake again.
One advantage of this magnesium supplement is its manageable size—it's in standard gel caps, not the oversized pills that are difficult to swallow. However, to get a similar dose to the larger pills, you'll need to take two of these. I personally don't find swallowing big pills a challenge, so it's not an issue for me. Overall, these are effective, just like the larger versions; it's all about your personal preference and dosage needs.
I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my mom, and she absolutely loves items like this. When I first opened the box, I was surprised by its size, as I had expected something smaller. However, the larger size turned out to be a pleasant surprise, and I think she'll appreciate it even more.
This roller is just average. The stone lacks polish, making it feel quite inexpensive. If you're just looking for something functional, it works, but it's clearly a mass-produced item similar to those found at flea market stalls. Given the price, you can find better quality alternatives. I wouldn't buy this again.
My husband is really happy with this compact kit because it doesn’t require plugging in—it's battery-operated and performs wonderfully!
These containers are fantastic for organizing my vitamins, making them perfect for both travel and home use. I love that the lid stays securely closed, even during travel, so there's no need for a ziplock bag or rubber band to keep it safe.
To me, this product is accurate, and I can confidently say that after testing it. I’ll skip listing the product specs, but I want to highlight that the scale is precise, easy to use, and has a useful blue-lit display. It’s even more impressive when compared to other scales, offering great value for its price. The included tape measure is a nice bonus, adding even more convenience.
Unfortunately, the bottom of the mask doesn't stay closed, which means it doesn't effectively trap germs in or keep others out.
I struggled to get this guard to work properly. Even after re-boiling it when it was too tight the first time, it still didn’t work. Plus, considering the price, I’m disappointed it didn’t meet my expectations.
It effectively prevents pain in the rear, just as promised.
This product caused severe irritation, which I never expected from something marketed for babies. I experienced chemical burns that almost sent me to the ER. I absolutely do not recommend it.
These insoles are incredibly sturdy, offering excellent support. While they are firm and take some effort to trim, the comfort they provide makes it worth the extra effort. I’ll definitely be purchasing more for my boots.
The bags have poor quality, with seams that tear open as soon as you put anything inside. They would be great if they were sturdier, but as they are, I can’t rate them highly.
We ordered a three-pack of these glasses, and the first pair lasted just a week. The second pair lasted two weeks, and the third one broke within two minutes. The arms unscrewed easily, and we either couldn’t find the pieces or would need a repair kit.
These are perfect for use at home or while traveling.
This product has a horrible smell and taste. I made the mistake of trying another flavor, and it had the same awful rancid vitamin taste. Definitely avoid this unless you enjoy that kind of flavor.
It cleans both the body and hair thoroughly, leaving a pleasant almond-like fragrance. Some may need a conditioner afterward.
This curler feels exactly the same as my old one, even with the replacement rubber. It curls my lashes just like the previous model.
I got this for my cats, but they didn’t respond well. I ended up using pill pockets instead, which worked much better.
This water bottle is perfect for my office. Its small size makes it easy to store and discreet to use, plus it's simple to refill with the hot water dispenser at work. It holds heat better than other options and stays in place once positioned.
The taste of this product is awful—chalky and it doesn’t dissolve properly.
My wife wears these all the time!
After 40 years of taking supplements, I’ve finally found an affordable multi that works great for me. I’m healthy and attribute it to this supplement, despite not always having the best diet.
This is a cute item for a little girl's party.
My husband loves this product. He uses it daily, and it mixes well, giving him the supplementation he wants at an affordable price.
It's okay, but it’s a bit rough on my scalp.
This gadget saved me from needing a new microwave! I was skeptical, but it worked great for fixing the broken handle. Highly recommended!
This dispenser is perfect for controlling the amount of liquid hand cleaner, ensuring just the right amount is dispensed every time. It’s a great solution for managing Hibiclens at home.
I’m thrilled to have found a non-fish source of omega-3s, especially in a gelatin-free gummy. As a vegetarian, this is a game-changer. The flavor is fruity, and I’m happy with the product, though I wish the quantity was more consistent with the other supplement I bought.
Comfortable socks!
When they stayed in place, they worked well. I used them with more open-toed shoes, but they might work better in closed shoes. Overall, they were comfortable when they stayed in place.
This toothpaste is decent, but not remarkable. It’s overpriced for the results, as I haven’t noticed any significant improvements in oral health. It’s minty, but I need to use more than usual to feel clean.
These B-vitamin tubes are perfect for vegetarians or anyone dealing with stress. They’re portable, taste good, and make me feel calmer and less anxious. I’m happy with them.
This curler is light and easy to use, but it didn’t give me any noticeable curls. I followed the instructions, but no curling happened. I lost the battery compartment cover, so I couldn’t return it.
Cascade does a fantastic job! I’ve used it for years, and it’s worth every penny.
I’m not the most disciplined when it comes to brushing my teeth, but this portable toothbrush helps me remember. It’s easy to carry around and makes brushing quick and easy.
This container holds a lot of pennies! While it’s not the most convenient for travel due to its size, it looks great displayed at home.
These glasses look fantastic. The vision is crisp, and they definitely improve night driving. They’re sturdily built and exceed expectations.
I’ve been using this product for a couple of years, and it works well without causing any side effects.
The quality doesn’t seem as high as the more expensive brands, but for the price, it’s still decent.
I take superfood supplements regularly, and I believe they’ve helped me stay healthy. These are great for supporting gut health.
Purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower event.
I've recently started enjoying gel manicures! No need for drying time, and they last for weeks! I'm thrilled with the vibrant and bright colors in this set. The polish applies thinly, so it takes a few coats to get full coverage. The glitter polish is a little chunky, which looks nice but can be tricky to apply evenly. The packaging was great, with foam padding to keep the bottles secure and a color dot on top for easy identification. Overall, I'm satisfied and would repurchase.
It’s pricey, but it really works! I’ll definitely continue buying it.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work for me at all. I ended up returning it.
I was a bit unsure about ordering these because some reviews mentioned they were small. But I decided to give them a try at the price point, and if they were too small, my daughter could use them. I'm so glad I ordered, as they fit perfectly! The seam down the middle helps prevent the mask from puffing up when talking or breathing. Wish I'd ordered them sooner!
Ideal for when you really need to clear your nose...
I didn't expect much from these clippers at the price (about ten bucks when I bought them), but I was pleasantly surprised by their performance. They cut just as well as higher-priced models, offering a clean cut without pulling. The adjustable length dial works smoothly with firm clicks for each length. It includes two guides, giving you extra adjustability. The only downside is the plastic case and attachments, which feel flimsy and might not withstand drops. But for the price, the performance is excellent. I’m impressed.
Perfect for my kitchen, effectively keeping odors at bay.
This is my fourth reorder.
Wow! This is incredible—100% effective. Best purchase ever!
For the price of $7.62, I didn’t expect anything exceptional, but after wearing it for less than 6 hours, the elastic stretched out and no longer worked. I hoped to get at least a week of use from each bandage, but I doubt I’ll get that.
I love the opportunity to try different items. Thanks for offering that!
It’s pricier than other older cooking sprays, but the quality justifies the higher price. I truly appreciate the premium quality.
This is not a good mask. It’s not waterproof and is made from very thin material. Not recommended for buyers.
As someone with sensory issues who struggles to stay motivated to clean, these gloves were great. The unlined, thin pair fits perfectly for bathroom cleaning. They're long enough to protect my sleeves without worrying about them rolling up. While they feel thin, they provide good protection from chemicals and water. I'm concerned they might tear quickly, but so far, they’re durable and worth the investment.
It's very bitter... I tried drinking it in different ways—hot, cold, in various rooms—but it didn't give me the relaxed feeling I hoped for. I don't plan to buy it again.
Excellent for relieving muscle cramps and sore muscles.
It’s a great concept for adults with desk jobs who have a water bottle nearby. However, the device only blinks once to remind you to drink, and if you miss it, it shuts down. It would be better if it blinked repeatedly or emitted a warning sound to prompt you to drink. This feature doesn’t work well for children.
Thanks for the quick delivery and, most importantly, for a product I can use. I will definitely be ordering more from you in the future.
Perfect for storing my eyeglasses, earrings, pills, and loose chains.
It tasted good, but it was quite expensive.
This is the best thing I’ve bought in a long time.
Heat, humidity, blazing sun, and salty air make high-quality sunglasses essential for outdoor activities. Most sunglass holders are made of cloth, absorb moisture, and lose their form over time. I discovered Cablz through a fishing guide and was impressed by how perfect they are for this environment. Now, my entire family uses them, and we're all happy with them!
Works as expected but may shift after closing, causing the case to close at an angle.
This product lacks durability. The stone is light and dissolves quickly. Don’t ignore the reviews—this product is marginal at best. The maker needs to improve it or find more durable materials for a better experience.
These socks are stylish and don't look like "old lady socks." I’m in my 40s and had sclerotherapy done, and I needed support after wearing the doctor's prescribed socks. These stay up and make my legs feel better when worn with my sneakers.
I chose the "Sweet" flavor over the "Savory" because I prefer the vegetables it contains, but I didn't enjoy the taste. It altered the flavor of any food I added it to, so it's been sitting unused on my counter for over a month now.
The value is great, though the freshness could be more intense. This might be because marjoram isn't as strong as oregano. I’ve had good experiences with this company and will continue to purchase from them.
This product is perfect for personal hygiene, especially if you have hemorrhoids. It’s very effective in helping with cleanliness and can be easily dried for future use.
This product cleans and lubricates, keeping your shaver in top condition.
I started using this supplement for PCOS-related hormonal acne. After taking it for a month, my skin has improved significantly, with fewer breakouts. The flavor has a slight tartness followed by a peppery bite, which can burn your throat a little, but I’ve gotten used to it.
I used one box as a gift, but part of the box came apart during transport. I think I need to superglue the fabric onto the box for it to hold up.
This product didn’t work and appeared to have been previously opened. It seems like a poor product overall.
I have a 35 lb dog who loves chewing. He had trouble with the large chewing part but managed to chew off the foot pads, leaving the rest behind. He was still interested in tearing it apart, but it was a bit hard for him to get a good bite.
Nitropics is a high-quality brand that makes excellent supplements. Their products consistently attract top-notch reviews, which is why I decided to try them. I’m happy with the results so far, and I’m confident they’ll exceed my expectations.
This works well at a bargain price. It’s less gooey than the name brand, but it still does the job I needed it to do. I use it frequently for medical purposes and am happy to find it here.
I appreciated the extra suction cup hook and rubber scrubber that came with the set. The sponges are soft, slip-resistant, and clean your face without leaving any residue. Though not a must-have, it’s a great alternative to a washcloth for those with sensitive skin. It’s gentle and safe for all skin types.
After using Clear Tract powder for six months, I haven’t had a bladder infection, which has been a long-standing issue. It works well on gram-negative bacteria like E. coli. For gram-positive bacteria, I recommend using oil of oregano. Between Clear Tract, oil of oregano, and other supplements, I’ve felt great and haven’t had any infections since.
Dr. Mercola Organic White Grapefruit Essential Oil has a fresh aroma. I initially hoped it would smell different from my pink grapefruit oil, but the scent is quite similar. It works well in diffusers and candle making, though the scent is lighter than I expected. I wouldn't use it in skin or lip recipes but recommend it for diffusing.
Traumeel is the best homeopathic cream I’ve used. It speeds up the healing of bruises, surgical wounds, and more. It has been especially effective after surgeries and injuries.
While the product works as intended, we quickly discovered it produces noise. When plugged in, the remote section of the cord emits a high-pitched sound combined with a low clanging noise.
This product is fantastic! It requires a good stir when first opened, but it tastes great and the added protein is a bonus.
This lemon juice is a favorite of mine and I plan to use it indefinitely!
I would rate this lower if possible. Despite ignoring negative reviews, hoping to like it, I was disappointed. It's sweetened with Maltitol, which causes a spike in my blood sugar, unlike Erythritol or Stevia. The product’s listing didn’t include ingredients, just "no added sugar," which I should have taken as a warning. To make matters worse, the return policy is non-existent.
The taste is amazing! I mix it with Ultima Replenisher Electrolyte Drink for my golf sessions, and it helps keep my energy levels up during intense physical activity.
I would not recommend this product. On my first attempt, I slipped off my chair and fell. Further attempts caused painful gouges on my skin. It’s a painful, frustrating experience.
These made excellent wedding favors! We used them to create s'more wedding favors, and they turned out perfectly.
The edible massage oil offers a surprising experience with its warming and tingly sensation. It has an interesting taste and can be used as a lip gloss or massage oil. The cherry-gloss look in a corked glass bottle makes it a charming addition. I’d suggest trying other flavors too; they’re equally delightful!
While I like the variety and the colors, the cushion didn’t work as expected. I applied it according to the instructions, but it didn’t stick well and kept rolling under my heel. It was uncomfortable during longer use.
The size is perfect and it feels smooth, fitting just right.
Ideal size for travel and works very well.
This roll-on provides a menthol scent with an icy cool sensation that lasts around 15-20 minutes, providing relief after workouts or a long day, but requires frequent reapplication for sustained relief.
This toothbrush is fantastic. It includes replacement heads, so it will last a while. Great price and excellent performance with a variety of modes.
I've used several of Life Extension’s products, and this one seemed effective, though I didn’t notice a significant difference over the course of a month.
The product performs as advertised and the vendor provided good service.
This mask works well, though it lacks a filter. Still, it offers decent protection.
A good product for toilet cleaning, easy to use and provides solid value.
Do not purchase this! The product is overrated and does not work well. The battery life is much shorter than claimed. It’s overpriced and certainly not worth the investment.
I’ve tried many cotton options for vaping, and this one is by far the best. It’s highly absorbent and durable, offering 13 feet of cotton, more than enough for several re-wicks. I’m thoroughly impressed.
I received several Christmas rolls, but unfortunately, some of them were duplicates.
I’m unsure what my autistic son would do without these—he relies on them!
This compact travel-sized product does its job well and even comes with an insulated pouch and gift box, making it a great gift idea.
I didn’t find this item necessary, even though I wanted it. The quality is good, though.
It’s effective for soothing dry, irritated eyes, though it’s a bit pricey for my budget.
The product feels too thick and large for my needs.
The arm stand lacks sturdiness and shouldn’t be relied on for stable support.
This device gives quick readings, though I’m unsure about the overall accuracy. It’s compact and easy to carry around.
Johnson & Johnson consistently delivers high-quality products, unlike generic brands. Their swabs always stay attached to the stick, which isn't always the case with others.
My trusted electronic toothbrush finally gave out, so I replaced it with this model. It’s just as effective as my previous one, with convenient USB-C charging. I’m pleased with its long-lasting charge.
The eyelash curler didn’t grip my lashes and lacked the curve needed for a good curl. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
The product didn’t work as intended—it didn’t cut the hair. Very poor quality.
This ointment helped relieve my headache and muscle pain quickly. I’ve ordered it three times because it works well for me.
Great product quality, exactly as described, and delivered promptly.
I tried this in combination with AeroShot Energy based on reviews and was excited. Unfortunately, while it offers fresh breath, it didn’t provide any noticeable energy boost. Save your money and consider other options. Stick with Altoids for breath freshness.
This product is sweetened, but it doesn’t have any distinct flavor, just a faint salty taste. I’ve been using it to help rehydrate my elderly cat with IBD, and it’s effective for that purpose.
These stones are a great deal for the price. They are not as large or smooth as others I’ve bought, but for the cost, they are acceptable. However, I was disappointed there was no list of the included stones.
These tablets work great! I have an older washer that tends to get a musty smell. I used these tablets, and after following the instructions, the washer was much cleaner and fresher.
These shoe cushions didn’t stay attached and came off after just a few minutes of wear. Very disappointing.
After a year of trying to manage my blood pressure naturally, I finally saw a significant improvement, dropping into the 120s. I’m very happy with this product and will be reordering.
These dryer balls are an affordable, eco-friendly alternative to dryer sheets. They don’t leave any fuzz on my clothes and are expected to last well over a year.
These glucose tablets taste good and provide a quick sugar boost.
These bags are small and thinner than I expected. They’re not suitable for all trash bins, but I appreciate that they are biodegradable and will continue to use them in other ways.
Good value for the price.
These are ideal for both travel and home use.
After installing it in my kitchen, the difference in odor when leaving dishes overnight is remarkable.
The scent of this product is strong but pleasant. I only need to use a small amount for it to work, and the fragrance is subtle on clothing. It’s great for anyone who enjoys a fresh scent in their laundry.
The color is nice, and the pattern is aesthetically pleasing, but the paper feels thin compared to other brands. You get what you pay for in this case.
These stainless steel roller balls leak badly, and liquid drips from them. A poor-quality product.
These smell fantastic and lasted longer than expected. The bright colors and individually wrapped tablets make them a nice gift, though they contain non-natural ingredients. Make sure to check the list if you have skin sensitivities.
Very pleased with both the product and the seller’s service. I’ve used this Vita-C serum with my Clinique moisturizer for years, and it’s great to find it on Amazon with fast shipping.
Initially, I was concerned this product might be difficult to use, but it's flavorless and dissolves easily. The absence of a scoop is a downside for me, as I have to use scoops from my protein powder containers. However, I haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin yet. The container is small, considering the price.
Before becoming a parent, I had never heard of white noise machines. Now, I own several—one for each of my kids' rooms, a portable one for travel, and one that stays at Grandma's house. I even have a few extras just in case. White noise is so calming, and it helps cover all the noises in my old house, allowing me to quietly enter my kids' rooms. Among the many white noise machines I've tried, this one has the least annoying extra sounds. I mostly use the white noise settings, but the nature sounds and music are surprisingly pleasant. I wish it could cycle through all the songs, as it repeats "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" a bit too often. The light is soft, and you can choose your preferred color or let it cycle through the rainbow. A rechargeable battery would be a nice addition, but it's not essential. I highly recommend it for new parents!
My wife found them satisfactory.
After the birth of my two-year-old, I've been experiencing more upper back pain. My physical therapist recommended a posture corrector, and this one is a great choice. Unlike others I’ve tried, it has a wide, stretchy fabric strip between the shoulder blades that’s comfortable while still helping align my back and ease the pain. It's easy to put on and take off, and it’s very soft. A great value overall.
I am extremely disappointed with this order. The box contains four sets of metatarsal pads, but three of them are for the right foot only, while one set has both left and right pads. The sticky backing makes them difficult to reposition, and once placed, they can’t be adjusted. I was able to use one pair, and they provide some comfort, but I would have rated this higher if the pads were actually usable as pairs. Unfortunately, this product is now unusable for me.
This purchase was perfectly fine.
I like it! I usually mix it with half a banana, ice, and some Ovaltine, depending on my hunger. Two scoops cost less than $2 per meal. I use it for breakfast and sometimes dinner too. PRO TIP: Save the scoop from your previous purchase, as it can sometimes get buried at the bottom due to shipping.
It works well for removing old blackheads on softer skin, but not so effective on thicker skin.
I mistakenly gave this a 3-star rating initially, but it definitely doesn't deserve just one star! Despite using various guards on the blade, it doesn’t provide an even cut—there’s noticeable unevenness. It worked in a pinch during the pandemic, but a groomer informed me that it's one of the worst razors for pets. I would suggest exploring other options.
Best socks ever! They are warm, loose, and non-slip. I don't wear anything else. Absolutely love them!
This is now a staple in my gift stock. It's such a nice way to wrap a book or small gift. Lovely and simple to use.
This is fantastic! If you’ve ever used Armor All wipes, you’ll recognize the material. It’s great to have the microfiber cloth in such a convenient package for an affordable price.
I’m always looking for ways to make regular meals healthier. I substitute rice with cauliflower rice, replace white sugar with Stevia, and use beans whenever possible. For example, I made a brownie pie with low-sodium canned northern beans as the main ingredient. Don't knock it until you try it—this recipe is a game-changer! Here's the modified recipe that will surprise you: Ingredients: 2 cans low-sodium northern beans 1/3 cup cocoa powder 2/3 cup quick oats 1/4 cup applesauce 1/2 tsp salt 1 tbsp vanilla extract 1 cup sugar (half white, half agave) 1 cup chocolate chips (half milk, half dark) Instructions: Add all ingredients to a food processor and blend on low while drizzling oil until smooth. Add chocolate chips and blend until fully mixed. Pour into a greased 8-inch pan, bake for 25 minutes, and refrigerate for 4+ hours. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream for the best results!
I had never considered using something like this for my glasses, but after seeing an infomercial, I gave it a try. After wearing glasses for over 20 years, I didn’t realize how often I was pushing them back up my nose. Since using this product, I’ve noticed my glasses stay in place longer, which has been a nice surprise. The slight peppermint scent is pleasant and doesn’t bother my skin. Now, I don’t leave home without it!
This is a solid soap designed for cleaning painting brushes. It's great for oil, watercolor, and acrylic brushes. The process is simple—just wet the brush, rub it on the soap, and rinse. It’s effective and works similarly to the brush soap I currently use.
A nice finishing touch for small gift boxes.
Not too hot, but offers a supportive medium stretch and compression.
I get this product every year to keep everyone’s immune system in check.
This product has been a real gift for caregivers like me. I care for my 41-year-old son, and these make the process of diapering him much easier, despite my own health challenges. If you're a caregiver for an adult, this is a must-have.
A high-quality card that feels great in a professional setting. I will definitely continue to purchase these, and the sympathy cards are a great value as well.
I've been using probiotics for a while now, and they definitely support my digestion. These gummies are tasty and effective, with 5 billion CFUs per serving. Highly recommend!
Whether it’s a discounted or free item, it can go either way—good or bad. I remember visiting my Grandpa as a kid, and my dad would always bring an electric drill to grind his thick toenails. Now I’ve inherited some of those traits, including thick toenails. Fortunately, these BeautyMe Nail & Toenail Clippers are extremely well-made, with long, ergonomic handles and sharp curved blades. They work perfectly on my thick toenails, but be careful as the sharp blades can easily cut skin.
High-quality pads soaked in witch hazel. Convenient and reasonably priced. I use them on my face, neck, ears, and even for cleaning cuts and scratches.
Bought these as a gift for a friend, and she loves them. No issues so far, so I’m happy with the purchase.
Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for.
My pelvic therapist recommended this, and it hasn’t caused me any issues. It’s easy to wash and doesn’t irritate my skin.
A great set of gloves that can be used for a variety of tasks. You get several pairs, and they’re latex-free, making them ideal for people with allergies. The material is strong, and the length is slightly longer than standard, providing a better fit. Excellent quality gloves overall.
It arrived on time, but I’m no longer happy with it. The medium heat setting is inconsistent, and the pad bunches up, so I wouldn't recommend buying this.
Great value for the price. I’ve found this product to be consistent and just as good as what I’d find in big box stores.
I lost two leads during my move, and these replacements work great.
Cute design! I’m using it to wrap presents for my granddaughter.
It arrived exactly as expected.
This is just what I needed to keep my medication organized. It’s convenient and ensures I don’t forget any doses. It includes slots for morning, noon, night, and bedtime for each day of the week.
My daughter loves it! It helps prevent makeup waste, unlike a sponge that absorbs the product.
Bought this for my mini pig, Dewey, and it keeps his skin and coat soft and shiny.
I have nothing bad to say about the product. It’s one of the nicest scents I’ve used, especially if you're a fan of lavender. My only regret is not realizing the price is for just one bottle, but that's my own fault.
It fits perfectly, just as advertised, and also fits my Merkur 34c. The razor is a bit short but works fine. Expensive, considering the razor's low cost.
My husband adds this to his daily smoothie of avocado, banana, and kale. The flavor is minimal, making it a great supplement without altering the taste of the smoothie.
I love this! You should definitely get one!
For such a lightweight and affordable chair, I was surprised at how well it’s made and how nice the fabric feels. However, for someone my size, the armrests can be uncomfortable after a while, and the chair sits a bit lower than I would prefer. My family, though, loves it and finds it very comfortable.
A must-have item for any first aid kit!
Nicely packaged and convenient for carrying around.
This product provides a gentle touch to your skin without the need for harsh rubbing. It is designed to last for a very long time.
My first experience with a Turmeric Curcumin product for chronic joint and muscle pain was surprising. I experienced relief quickly. Within days, I noticed a significant reduction in inflammation in my knees, and the pain disappeared. I now trust this product!
Exactly what I needed for my low back.
This multipack is priced just a bit higher than the cost of a single dose from my eye doctor.
Unfortunately, this product didn’t work as expected. It didn’t spin or clean as promised.
Definitely worth the investment.
My wife really enjoys using it.
One side has a floral covering, which was not shown in the photo. The shipping from China Post was slow.
Having worn contact lenses since 1973, I can confidently say this product works better than anything I've tried. It’s especially effective for cleaning lenses that have accumulated grime from pollution and irritants. While generics are fine, the Alcon brand stands out.
It was too hot for comfort and didn’t curl or straighten my lashes as advertised.
Since I can’t swallow large capsules, I open them up and mix them with juice. The taste is relatively pleasant compared to most. So far, so good!
I opted for the white color as it's the most affordable. The masks are soft and comfortable, and they fit my wife’s face better than others we’ve tried. The only downside is that these masks have two plies, but given the price, I can always double them up.
The product is fine and simple to use.
I absolutely adore this product. The fragrance is delightful, and the fact that it’s made from natural oils with no harmful chemicals is a big plus. I’ll definitely be purchasing it again soon.
It works effectively and is fun to use. It was interesting to see which waters were alkaline.
I absolutely love it! I can’t get enough of licorice!
This product is fantastic!
I add this to my banana and almond milk smoothies. It gives a nice color, and the taste isn’t overpowering. However, if you dislike beets, you might not enjoy it. The packaging is solid, though sometimes the powder gets stuck in the zip closures. When that happens, I simply transfer it to a glass jar.
The product performs as expected, but I initially thought it was made of silicon, though this isn’t a major issue.
We used these for our wedding, and while they were cute, a few arrived broken. Given the price, they were still worth it.
As someone dealing with arthritis, I needed a sizable heating pad for my knees. After multiple surgeries, I’ve gone through many cold and heat products. I’ve used this one daily for two months without any issues, whereas other electric heat pads I’ve tried have failed within 90 days. This product deserves a solid 4 stars from me.
I love this sunscreen! We used it for 4 hours by the lake, and neither my 5-year-old nor I got sunburned. While I usually use organic sunscreens, I had to rely on this one and it worked great!
The lid was cracked the first time I used it. I’m returning it, as the lid seems cheaply made.
I wasn’t fond of the taste, but they are tolerable. I’ve only been taking them for a short time, so I’m unsure how well they work yet.
This didn’t work for me. I can’t wear backpacks because they hurt my shoulders, and this product felt like wearing one—quite uncomfortable.
I couldn’t get this device to stay in place once I inserted it into the toe box of my shoe. It slipped out even after expanding it, making it useless. I’m returning it. It would work better with a design change, such as an adjustable wood block on the other end of the threaded bolt.
It works great, is sturdy, and I love the bristle cover.
The product performs well, with excellent cleaning action and efficient rinsing.
I absolutely love this item! I sleep on it every night!
The pads are stiff, and they don’t conform to my neck as they should. I have to pull the handles to get the necessary pressure. The massage is okay where I can feel it.
I found these uncomfortable, as the top band hit the wrong spot on my lower leg. The sizing chart was accurate, but they weren’t suitable for long-term use. They snag and tear easily, and I only wore them lightly at night.
These probiotics are somewhat pricey for just 14 days’ worth, but they seem to work well, especially after I finished antibiotics. They’re easy to swallow and don’t need refrigeration, though they should be kept away from heat.
I tried another brand once, but this one is by far the best on the market.
This eye mask is fantastic! It comes nicely packaged and works well to block out all light. The plush cushion provides ample room to open your eyes without pressure. The adjustable strap is a great feature—it stays in place without tangling in my hair.
The taste is great.
These are affordable readers that provide good value for the price. However, the price has increased from $5 to $15 in just a year, which is disappointing.
Pros: Eco-friendly, 100% cotton, soft on the skin, works well as a makeup remover, and is reusable. Cons: None!
This is my go-to artificial sweetener. I’ve been using it for 35 years, and it’s convenient, with no bitter aftertaste, despite containing saccharin.
This shaver is great for women. It’s easy to use, waterproof for shower use, holds a charge well, and cleans easily. It provides a close shave with no razor burn or bumps, making it perfect for legs, armpits, and other areas.
This product is amazing! It makes my skin feel silky soft and smells wonderful. I would definitely gift it to friends and family.
The product is easy to use, looks great, and is very accurate.
It worked great at keeping mosquitoes away.
This tool helped someone administer eye drops without the dropper touching her eye. It worked so well that I ordered another for myself.
My girlfriend loves this product.
This makeup brush was disappointing. The retractable design is convenient for travel, but the lids won’t stay on, making it unusable. Even after trying to adjust the lids, they just don’t fit. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
This would be great for a baby’s room, but not so much for my living room. I’ll save it for the next baby shower.
It looks nice, though it’s thinner than expected. I like the option to use kilograms instead of pounds.
It’s smaller than I thought, but it works well. There was some discoloration, but it didn’t raise any concerns.
These bars are well-balanced and low in calories. They make a great meal replacement when I can’t have a full meal.
I bought these for my nieces and nephews, as I enjoyed them in the '70s. The kids absolutely love them!
My boyfriend and I were curious about our blood types, so we ordered two kits. They were reasonably priced, and the process was quick and easy. It was a good experience, and we’ve since made an effort to donate blood more regularly.
These are well-constructed with three individual pockets that hold standard-sized capsules.
After using collagen powder for a few months, I’ve noticed real improvements in my digestive system. It helps with my stomach issues from colitis and adhesions. The powder mixes easily into my coffee or overnight oats without leaving any grainy texture. The large container, however, is half-filled, which seems wasteful. Despite that, it’s an excellent product at a great price.
I wasn’t thrilled with the flavor, although the ingredients are quite good.
I used this for a Tiffany bridal shower, and the color and paper quality were perfect. Highly recommend!
The balloons were great, but the tassel banner was a disappointment. It kept tearing and breaking while assembling. It would be better to buy a pre-assembled banner.
Should be used sparingly.
I’ve always struggled with heel slippage, but these have been the best solution for keeping my high heels secure.
These large bath bombs are fun and perform well, producing lovely suds. However, they left pink stains on my feet and towels, which was a downside for me. The color washes off in the laundry, but the extra coloring in such large bombs could be problematic for some.
I decided to try this after reading a review about its cooling effects for psoriasis. It worked wonders for my allergies and gave my skin a soothing, smooth feeling.
The product effectively smooths nails without requiring the use of a nail file.
After ordering these roller bottles twice, I have found them to be incredibly useful. They’ve become essential for me, especially during the night when I wake up with cramps or discomfort. I also carry two with me when I go out.
Unfortunately, this product doesn’t measure up. The ISO100 Fruity Pebble flavor is far superior in taste. This one is sweet, but not in a pleasant way, and is ultimately disappointing. However, since I’ve already bought it, I’m able to finish the bottle.
The product is poorly made, and I wouldn’t trust the positive reviews. It worked a couple of times, but then the electronics failed. It’s a complete waste of money, and the manufacturer doesn’t stand behind their product.
This is a great reference tool for lab values and other useful tidbits. It’s easy to read and very convenient.
I’ve been using this to create my own vape juice, and my partner prefers it over store-bought versions.
This heating pad is fantastic, with a great size that works well for my needs.
This brush is perfect for travel. It fits seamlessly with my dry oil tin.
This product is great and cheaper than most alternatives, while performing just as well!
I rely on these glasses daily. They make reading for pleasure effortless and enjoyable.
We bought these for frequent hotel stays, and they’ve been a game-changer. They eliminate unwanted odors, including cooking smells, even in rooms with no windows or fans. They’re especially helpful for removing fish odors.
We use this in a 10x12 bedroom that had some lingering smells from a chimney fire. Despite painting, installing new floors, and other upgrades, the smell persisted in one corner. After trying this product, the odor disappeared! It works best when left on all the time. While it’s not completely silent, the white noise is soothing, which is perfect for our baby. I’m very satisfied with this purchase.
This product didn’t hold up. It didn’t meet expectations.
My skin feels incredibly soft, and I’m pleased with the results. This bath sponge is gentle yet effective for exfoliating, and I highly recommend it.
This is the only tool I’ve found that removes water rings in toilets. It works perfectly and even gets rid of the rings around the kitchen sink drain.
This auto roller is an excellent version. It was delivered on time and works flawlessly. I would go as far as saying it’s the best one I’ve ever used.
Great product! I’ll definitely buy it again.
I absolutely love this! Using it daily has improved my skin, and I can see noticeable changes.
This was the best price I found, and it arrived earlier than expected.
I tried this product to remove hard water stains from my shower door. It helped but didn’t completely remove the spots. I’ll try applying it more frequently to see if it works better.
The product is just as advertised.
After trying another brand that only provided 2 hours of heat, we opted for this one. It’s a perfect size and keeps our feet warm without having to turn it on repeatedly. The heat-up time is quick, and the material is soft. We may skip the heated mattress pad this winter and just use this instead.
My Aria scale has been working great for over a year. It’s easy to use every day. The only downside is the inconvenience of resetting it when changing network names. Otherwise, it works perfectly.
I’ve never had dry or cracked feet until recently. After using this foot file, my feet felt smoother and softer almost instantly. It’s lightweight, easy to use, and can be used both wet and dry. The ceramic buffer and smooth beech wood handle make it comfortable to hold.
It’s shorter than I would prefer, and it doesn’t screw securely into the bottle, which makes me nervous when squeezing it, fearing it might pop off.
These tools are affordable and durable, and they will last a long time. While not as sharp as more professional sets, they still do the job well.
I noticed that the formula for The Works has changed. It no longer removes rust buildup as effectively as it did before. I had to scrub quite aggressively to remove the buildup.
This product tastes pretty good, though there’s a slight protein flavor. It mixed well, even though the directions recommend using two full scoops. Overall, it’s decent for the price.
