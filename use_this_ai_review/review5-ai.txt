Excellent value for the price. Performs efficiently and effectively.
I'll be using it again tonight before bedtime. During my first use, I could feel my neck cracking, which is a sign of relief from my chronic neck problems that often cause headaches and dizziness. I'm hoping this product addresses both issues; otherwise, I'll have to consult a doctor about the dizziness.
These are an excellent choice for Paleo enthusiasts looking to stick to whole, natural foods. They don't taste like a candy bar, which might disappoint those seeking something like traditional protein bars. However, I find them satisfying and filling for several hours. It's a great option for a quick, high-protein snack. Heating them in the microwave for 10 seconds as suggested improves the texture, although they can feel a bit greasy upon opening. The chocolate flavor is my favorite, and the mint flavor is very minty—so it may not be for everyone.
I’ve been using these for my three kids for several months now. Highly recommend them—excellent quality and quick shipping.
This scale works well, but it must be placed on a hard floor for accurate readings.
Fantastic product! It mixes easily and tastes amazing. Metabogreens is packed with fruits, vegetables, spices, and herbs, providing an energy boost I thought I had lost. Thanks, BioTRUST!
Excellent product and quality. Bought it as a gift, and they loved it. The colored tips are a nice touch.
These JSPA Non-Binding Socks are incredibly soft with no rough seams. I suffer from neurovascular issues that cause pain and swelling in my feet, and regular socks make the situation worse. These socks are thick, cushy, and breathable without making my feet sweat. They don’t leave indentations after wearing them for hours, making them a great choice. Highly recommend them!
I'm usually sensitive to strong odors, but these have a mild, pleasant fragrance that doesn’t overpower. My clothes smelled lightly scented, and I would definitely buy them again.
Oil of oregano is known for its powerful antiviral and antibacterial properties. While I prefer the softgel version (which usually contains 150mg per gel), these 50mg tubes are a more convenient and milder alternative. However, it's tricky to get all the oil out of the tube, and some remains at the bottom.
I wish this product had existed when my dog had spine issues! It’s incredibly easy to use, with adjustable Velcro strips for targeting different areas of the body. The automatic 20-minute shut-off timer ensures optimal use without overdoing it. I’ve been using it twice daily and already feel hopeful about its potential benefits for my back pain. I can also use it for my dogs, which is a huge bonus.
I’ve never been able to stick with a workout routine until now. This product not only keeps me hydrated but also boosts my stamina and performance. It's a bit cheaper on the Beachbody website, but with Amazon Prime, I get it in two days for the same price, so I opted to order it here.
These wipes are good but don’t handle hard, dried-on foods or wipe tables and counters effectively. Still, they perform decently for general cleaning tasks.
The item worked only once before it stopped functioning completely. It wouldn’t turn on, so I had to throw it away.
The adhesion of the pads is very strong, so you may need water to remove them if they stick too much. The scent is not overpowering, and these would make great gifts.
I wouldn't recommend this product.
This product is excellent for sensitive skin. It’s gentle, non-irritating, and rinses off easily. However, it's quite pricey.
It’s easy to use and doubles as a back scratcher—great multi-functional tool!
The wipes are thick and durable, which I appreciate.
Perfect for girls who love playing saxophones—very cute!
Good product overall.
I use fix tape often, but this brand doesn’t have the best adhesive. I prefer Anchor brand instead.
I gave it a 3 because I haven’t used it yet, but the blue ring was made of plastic when I expected it to be flexible. I think I’ll enjoy it when I use it on trips, though.
The frames are heavier than expected, and the nose pieces dig into my sides, so I can only wear them for short periods.
It's a bit pricey, but the scent is fantastic. It cleans well, and I love that it includes stain spray, sticks, and softener.
I’ve had these for 3 years and replaced the bulbs as needed. They’ve helped manage my allergies and also reduced the perm smell in my mom’s shop. Effective and worth the investment.
These wipes are too small and dry to be effective. They hardly remove any dirt, but they’re inexpensive.
It worked well initially, but after a year, the batteries needed replacing. I also noticed inconsistencies with the scale’s readings compared to others I’ve tried. After two years, it stopped working altogether, which is unacceptable.
I initially liked this product, but I’m glad I didn’t use it as it’s extremely sharp and dangerous. The tools are surgical-grade sharp, making them unsafe for personal use. Despite the beautiful case, I wouldn't recommend this for blackhead removal or pimple relief.
This product works well, and it’s much more affordable than custom options. It’s not perfect, but it’s better than most.
It’s a great straightener for travel or small touch-ups, but it doesn’t get as hot as advertised. I recommend it for fine, straight hair, but it may take longer for coarser or thicker hair types.
Really helpful for those hard-to-reach areas due to aging.
This natural product is fantastic for boosting immunity. It took several months to show results, but once it did, it kept me from getting sick as frequently and helped me recover faster.
This kit is perfect for fixing eyeglasses. It includes all the tools you might need, and I’m glad I have it on hand for future repairs.
Looks great and works wonderfully on my metal door.
I love these facial cleansing devices. This one is gentle and does a good job exfoliating dead skin. It’s easy to use, and while I haven’t tested the battery life, my other devices last a long time.
These bags are smaller than expected and not durable. They tore easily and didn’t fit in my trash cans. I wouldn’t buy them again.
A great solution at an affordable price.
Very convenient for reaching areas that are hard to access with age.
The turmeric powder has a rich aroma and excellent taste. It’s great for adding color and flavor to rice dishes. The small 4 oz bags help keep the product fresh. It’s a good value overall.
This eye mask is very comfortable and blocks out all light. The design around the nose area prevents light from leaking through. It’s well-made and reasonably priced.
These sanding blocks are great for various tasks, including card making and buffing nails.
This product is great, providing excellent results.
This product offers great value for its price, considering the amount of mg per capsule.
I deducted one star because the cotton wrapping on each earplug was difficult to remove, taking a while for just one. However, I found that in cooler temperatures, the cotton came off easily. After realizing this, I added the star back. The cotton wrapping might be an eco-friendly choice to avoid plastic, though I feel it wasn't necessary. I finally managed to unwrap one, and it fit comfortably and molded nicely into my ear.
The mask has thick layers that don't lie flat against your face, making it uncomfortable for long wear. I prefer other masks over this one.
These drops are a delightful little treat! The taste is pleasant, and they effectively work when dealing with occasional bloating or "gas."
Wow! My sister recently shared that her husband bought a foot massager from a membership club, which they thought was a waste of money. This one, however, is an exception! Even though I received it at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review, I am truly impressed. The variety of functions, such as air pressure for adjustable intensity, kneading, and shiatsu massage, provides a comprehensive experience. The timer and auto function make it user-friendly, and the glowing lights add a touch of tech appeal. Although heavy, the massager is built well, and the handle is convenient. The covers for the foot areas are detachable, but I have not figured out how to remove them yet. After using it, I feel a noticeable difference in my feet and lower legs.
My grandmother used to buy this product, and it truly works without giving off an unpleasant scent like other sprays. It masks odors effectively, without overpowering or mixing with other smells. It's a well-balanced fragrance that I enjoy and haven't gotten tired of.
This product works as advertised. I use it to spray my gym sneakers, and it neutralizes the smell effectively with minimal scent.
I am a fan of live music, especially live rock concerts. After years of attending these events and dealing with tinnitus, I decided to invest in earplugs. As an audiophile, I needed something that wouldn't muffle the sound, and these earplugs deliver. They provide noise reduction while preserving the sound quality. After using them at a metalcore concert, my ears didn't ring, and I could still hear everything clearly, just quieter. They may make conversations harder to hear, but they are essential for protecting your hearing at loud concerts. The earplugs stayed in place despite active movement, which is a plus. They're discreet, comfortable, and come with a convenient carrying case. Highly recommend them for anyone attending loud live music events!
This is an outstanding stain remover – it works wonders!
This product does exactly what it promises, removing lint effectively.
If you have to wear a brace daily after surgery, this product is worth every penny. It allows you to replace the sleeve whenever you need to, and you can easily adjust the size for a better fit.
These replacements fit perfectly with my Oakley Radar. The rubber is slightly firmer than the original, but still works wonderfully. After 10 years, it's like having a brand-new pair!
I have been using styling products for years, and I was looking for a flat iron that performs well for both straightening and creating light waves. This one heats up quickly and has a sleek black design with a long swivel cord. However, the temperature display's color makes it hard to read. While the iron works fine for straightening, it lacks the necessary grip for curling. If you're looking for an iron for straightening only, this one could work for you, but for more versatile styling, it may not be the best choice.
These bottles are great for family recipes. The dark color helps protect sensitive oils from direct light, and the roller heads work perfectly.
Unfortunately, the product arrived DOA, but I’m currently in contact with the seller for a replacement.
A good product overall.
This tool works like a charm for lining up an undercut. It cuts close without hurting the skin. My brother even wants to steal it, but I won’t let him!
This is my favorite product, and I was thrilled to find it again after it disappeared from stores. It's fat-free and delicious, unlike any other brand I've tried. The six bottles arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
The scent of this product is amazing, though it seems to be mislabeled as unscented. I find it effective at removing stains without damaging delicate fabrics. It works well on hand-washables, and I appreciate the travel-friendly 2 oz spray size. While it may not be as effective as stronger stain removers, it’s safe for most fabrics.
This vitamin has been a helpful addition for my eyes, though it’s more effective as a preventive measure. It doesn’t seem to help much with my father’s macular degeneration, but it helps reduce floaters and is easy to swallow when taken with food.
This 3.5-gallon bucket is perfect for general use. It's durable, food-grade, and well-sized for around-the-house tasks.
I don't see the point of brush straighteners; they don't perform as well as a regular flat iron.
After using this product daily for a month, I didn’t notice any significant results. It also makes your face look oily, which I find unappealing.
This sleep mask fits larger heads comfortably and blocks out light well, though it can be tricky to find the perfect fit. The soft foam cups prevent eye creases but sometimes catch in my hair. I've gone back to my old sleep mask, which is my all-time favorite.
I use these overnight with some foot cream, and they do a fantastic job softening my rough heels.
After recently undergoing gum surgery, I had the opportunity to try this toothpaste. It has a refreshing taste and cleans well. The gel is a mild yellowish color and doesn’t cause any stinging or burning like some toothpastes. It's the perfect product for post-surgery, but it’s also great for anyone with sensitive gums. Highly recommended.
These straps do exactly what I need—keep my sunglasses in place while I run. They’re easy to install by simply sliding them onto the earpieces, and now I don’t have to constantly adjust my sunglasses. They stay put and I forget I’m even wearing them. A great purchase!
I really just needed the Buffer Block, but this entire kit was so affordable that I decided to buy it. You get a lot for the price, and I’m very satisfied with my purchase. It was packaged neatly, too!
This product is exactly as described. It’s well-packaged and the instructions are clear and helpful. You can either pee on it while sitting on the toilet or place urine in a cup. I compared it to my home tests, and the results were identical. I’ll be purchasing more in the future. Update: After comparing with other brands, all of them were accurate.
Soak the loofah in warm water, then use scissors to snip it into small pieces. Bury these pieces under aquarium gravel or plant soil. The roots will anchor to the loofah, which makes for an affordable alternative to lava rock or driftwood.
Unfortunately, this didn’t provide the relief I was hoping for my severe RA in my hands. My condition might just be too advanced. The fragrance is nice, and it applies easily, though.
I love the shimmering, iridescent look of these small ziploc pouches. They are perfect for organizing small items like earrings or knickknacks. They’re also smell-proof, which makes them great for storing spices or tea leaves. I would highly recommend these, especially for flea market sellers. They’re pretty and versatile!
This product does not work, and I regret purchasing it.
I haven’t used it much yet, but I inspected it thoroughly when it arrived and found it to be very sturdy. The snap closure is secure, and the size is perfect for a 4-compartment sleeve. It’s bright, so I can easily find it in my bag without digging through all my stuff. I’m happy with it for two reasons: the bright colors and the secure snap closure that prevents everything from spilling out.
I read that lavender can naturally deter moths, and since we were having a moth problem in our new condo, I decided to try this product. It seems to be working well, and the fragrance is lovely. This is definitely a better alternative to mothballs!
While this brush is very cute, it’s surprisingly soft and not effective for use.
I wish I had started using ear protection at raves sooner! These are discreet, comfortable, and block out unwanted noise, making it easier to hear my boyfriend without him shouting. After trying them, he was impressed, and we ended up buying him his own pair.
I have high arches and size 14 feet. These shoes fit well, and the arch support is good for most people who need basic support. For long-term use, you might want to look for a more supportive shoe, but these are fine for shorter periods.
This item doesn’t fit under an airline seat.
The finger tops are a bit sharp.
The Energizer CR123A batteries for my Arlo cameras have been disappointing. In a pack of 50, none of them lasted more than 6 days, which is far worse than other brands I’ve tried, like Tenergy and Titanium, which lasted much longer. I won’t be buying these again.
I tried this product for an hour on different areas, and it worked well. The medium speed was the best for me since the lowest speed was too slow. My neck and upper back feel great now. The heat doesn’t get very warm, but I still like the device and plan to use it a lot. Update: Be careful when using it, as it can bruise if you apply too much pressure. I still use it but with caution.
As expected.
I thought this product’s flavor would be bland, but it actually has no taste at all.
This neck item is too small for the average person, though it might fit someone with a very thin neck.
My husband has trouble swallowing large pills, but he can take these gummies with no issue. They work well for him.
It’s easy to use, but I haven’t noticed a significant difference yet.
This works great and fits my curvy figure well! It stays in place and is lightweight enough to prevent overheating. I love it and plan to give some as gifts.
A very nice set with smooth filing.
I took these on my vacations to both Costa Rica and Alaska. They were easy to use and worked great!
I loved these bags and the quick delivery. I’ve already used them and given some to my friends.
It gets the job done.
My girlfriend loves it.
These pillboxes are decent. The lids are secure and there’s enough space inside. However, there’s a design flaw: once the pills are inside, the only way to get them out is by dumping the box upside down. Even with my slim fingers, I can’t retrieve the pills without making a mess. Despite this, the product does its job well.
This is a pleasant essential oil blend in a roll-on tube. I applied it to my temples and wrists, and it smelled great. Unfortunately, the fragrance faded within 30 minutes. While the oils seem to be of good quality, the scent doesn’t last long enough for me to give this a higher rating.
I like this, but the handle needs to be about 4 inches longer.
I’ve been using CoQ10 for several years, mainly for heart health. These gelcaps are large but easy to swallow, and the dosage is just one per day. They seem to be of good quality, and I’m satisfied with the product.
It arrived quickly, and it works as expected.
I often suffer from all-day migraines that are resistant to every remedy I've tried. It's been a frustrating experience until I found this ice roller, which offers some relief from the throbbing pain, allowing me to eat and carry on with my day. The roller part detaches for easy freezing, and the design includes convenient notches on both sides, making it easy to remove and attach the handle without damaging the roller. It's simple to use and effective at providing comfort.
This product does exactly what it promises! It's easy to apply, gentle on fabrics, and the convenience of being disposable makes it ideal for quick use.
I’m extremely satisfied with these silicone scar sheets. They’re durable and adhere well to my skin, staying in place throughout the day without irritation. Despite their strong adhesion, they are painless to remove and leave no residue behind. The size is just right for smaller areas, and the 10-foot roll offers excellent value. I’d definitely recommend this high-quality product for its performance and affordability.
This set is absolutely amazing! From the back scrubber to the body brush, each piece transforms my shower routine into a relaxing spa experience. I’m incredibly happy with this purchase and would happily buy it again.
I’m in love with this protein powder! It’s one of the best whey products I’ve tried—fresh, clean taste, and mixes perfectly in smoothies. The quality is exceptional, and while the packaging is eye-catching, it’s the product itself that stands out. I’m thrilled to have found TRUproteins and will definitely be stocking it in my pantry.
Unfortunately, these are the worst files I’ve ever used. I’ve tried many others, but these have been extremely disappointing. They’re poorly made, and I can’t recommend them at all. Wish I could return them, but they’re just bad quality.
These cotton balls are smaller than what I’m used to from other stores, so I find myself using two at a time for tasks like removing nail polish. While the quantity says 200, it feels more like 100 in practical use. They’re okay for basic needs, but the smaller size means you go through them faster.
This product worked wonders for my stinky feet! It completely resolved the issue, and I’ll definitely be purchasing again.
This product works great for my bunny’s litter box. It’s effective and serves its purpose well.
I appreciate the variety of pill shapes in this organizer, but unfortunately, it didn’t work well for my small pills. Larger pills would probably fit better, but my smaller ones ended up being crushed. I think this would be great for those with larger pills.
While pricey, this toothpaste has been effective. After using it for three weeks, I haven’t noticed any issues with cavities, which is promising.
This shampoo is effective for combating dandruff, and while the lid may not be the best, it’s still worth it. It’s been helping with my dry scalp and dandruff after just a few uses.
Cleans my pontoon boat with ease. No complaints!
Hoping this product helps with my hard water issues. Will update after more use.
If you're a fan of sweet potatoes, this product is perfect. It's a sweet potato fruit bar that’s nutritious and portable—ideal for hikes or keeping in your bag as an emergency snack. A great alternative to sugary bars.
These knee sleeves are lightweight and easy to put on and take off. They provide noticeable relief from knee pain during exercise, and I recommend them to anyone who experiences discomfort in their knees.
While the strength is better than some I’ve tried, the size and shape aren’t ideal for men’s shoes. These would be better suited for women’s shoes due to their narrower design.
Bought this for my wife, and she loves it! One of several similar items we’ve purchased in the last year, and this one’s a hit.
This watch is perfect for my job, which requires frequent hand washing. It hangs from a lanyard when I need to check the time or tucks into my shirt pocket when I don’t. The watch is accurate and rugged enough for my needs.
A small but effective massager. It’s a bit too strong for my preferences at times, but adjusting my position resolves that. I also appreciate the option for heat and the stretchy strap for easy attachment to a chair.
This product doesn’t work well for me. The fingers are too long and bulky, making it difficult to use. I won’t be purchasing this again.
I’ve ordered these calcium supplements several times. They’re easily absorbed and come quickly, which is great for my needs.
These coconut oil supplements are a great option for those who don’t like the taste of coconut oil but still want to reap its benefits. Though the pills are a bit large and the recommended dosage is three at a time, I’ve noticed a small energy boost and feel comfortable taking them while breastfeeding.
This product works just as expected. No surprises!
While the price for this zinc lozenge pack is a bit high, it works well to speed up recovery from colds and flu. I prefer Airborne for its better value, but this is still a solid choice.
The picture doesn’t quite match the actual product. The colors are darker than expected, but I love the quality of the paints. I’ll find a use for them despite the color discrepancy.
I tried the dragon fruit-flavored sparkling water, and unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy it. Despite its zero-calorie, sugar-free claim, the flavor just didn’t appeal to me. I’m hoping the other flavors in the variety pack might be better.
My husband suffers from chronic dry eyes, and these wipes have provided the relief he’s been seeking. He loves them!
The product requires a lot of elbow grease to get things clean, making it more effort than it’s worth. I’d rather stick to simpler solutions.
This brush is long, sturdy, and easy to clean. It works well and seems to be built to last.
This product works great! It cuts my nails easily and efficiently—very impressed.
I’ve bought over 20 pairs of these arch supports for my shoes to help with my plantar fasciitis. While they don’t stick permanently, they’re comfortable and provide good support. I particularly love the heart-shaped design and find them ideal for my tall arch.
If I have to use a cane, I’m happy it’s this one! It’s not only functional but also stylish and affordable.
I’ve switched from Tide to Method products, and I’m so glad I did. It gets stains out without needing pretreatment and leaves clothes looking newer. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant, and the compact bottles save space on the shelf.
These dairy-free products taste good, though they are a bit expensive for the quantity.
These support stockings are fantastic—comfortable, effective, and well-priced. I’ll definitely purchase again.
The smell of this product is lovely, but unfortunately, the spray button doesn’t work.
These products work well, but I wish they lasted a bit longer.
This nose clip is ineffective—it just doesn’t stay on.
This product didn’t work for my foot pain. The elastic around the pad ended up causing more discomfort than relief, making it a poor choice for me.
This product is perfect for soothing sunburns and relieving itchy or dry skin.
The air purifier is small but effective. After using it for a few nights, I noticed my sinus congestion was relieved. It seems to work well in my bedroom, and I look forward to testing it in other areas.
I didn’t enjoy this scent. While some people may like it, it wasn’t right for me, especially for use in drinks.
After several months, the chair began to fade, and when I contacted the seller about the issue, their response was unhelpful. I would recommend buying from a seller that offers a warranty for better customer support.
The product works exactly as described. No issues here!
This toy is great for both individual and couples’ play in the shower—adds some fun and excitement.
A great alternative to paper towels. It’s durable and easy to use for cleaning up messes.
This product works well in our RV, although the granules can be a bit messy when added to the commode.
No issues, works great.
My wife loves this product!
This was a good purchase for my son's party. It worked out well.
Easy to use for weighing horse feed and other items.
Bought this to add to paint for dying Sola wood flowers, and it worked great!
The suction power on this blackhead remover is amazing! You can feel it working, and the results are noticeable after just a few uses. It’s durable, easy to use, and comes with multiple heads for different needs. Great value for the price.
I bought this for my niece’s 21st birthday, and she loves it. It works perfectly for her travel needs.
This TENS unit has been a lifesaver for my back pain. After just two days of use, my pain was gone. It’s well-made, reasonably priced, and easy to use. Highly recommend!
The product includes a convenient zipper cover that easily attaches to standard desk chairs. It’s fully adjustable and offers great quality and support.
Everything is great.
This is an excellent tracking method for my dog’s heart medication schedule. It’s durable and snaps shut for safety. You can take one or more with you for convenience.
This portable nail file fits easily in my purse. It's a bit thicker than other crystal files, making it sturdier. While I typically prefer thinner files, this one works quite well.
It’s a bathroom cleaner—what else is there to say?
These tissues are soft yet strong—great quality!
I tried Nervine Tonic based on a recommendation from a well-known herbal company. It’s effective as a relaxant and sleep aid, but I found the sleep a bit too deep, making it hard to wake up. Use cautiously and pay close attention to dosage.
I previously reviewed this, but I was disappointed as it didn't work on my glasses. One side kept sliding off.
I stand all day at work, so I bought these for a pair of dressier shoes. My feet feel less fatigued than without them, but still slightly tired after long hours. They do make a noticeable difference. Highly recommend.
It stopped working after about a month.
I had been taking a 1000mg magnesium supplement, but this 400mg version seems more effective due to its superior bioavailability. I only need one caplet!
The product arrived as expected, and the container didn’t have a large air gap.
Deliciously amazing.
My daughter has chondromalacia patella, and this tape works wonderfully with another tape over it to keep her knee caps in place while dancing.
This hair remover works just as well as more expensive alternatives. It leaves the skin smooth without stubble and makes makeup application easier. Quick and easy to use. A great buy!
These are cute and arrived quickly. The big tags are easy to remove, and the horizontal pattern doesn't bother me. They fit my average-sized wrist, and I get compliments when I wear them. Great fair-trade purchase.
There’s less static than with other products, but I still experience quite a bit of static. I’m considering purchasing a second one, though it’s a bit pricey.
The cloths keep falling off the holder. Too inconvenient to use.
I love these! I use them on sore muscles and my face daily. They work effectively and are a great value with two options to choose from.
I’m giving this four stars instead of five because both bottles’ pills fit into one, making the extra bottles unnecessary. However, this is still a great supplement with no garlic aftertaste and easy to swallow.
I bought these for my grandmother (a non-mobile senior). They are too small to place in the bed before sleep. I'm now looking for a larger size.
These smell wonderful! I gave them as Christmas gifts, and my friends loved them.
I took this product to my physical therapist, but it didn’t fit well. It doesn’t support the back or pull the shoulders back as intended. My therapist does not recommend this product. I returned it.
This version lasts longer and is stronger than the original formula.
This mix gave me a bit of extra energy for two back-to-back tennis practices. I didn’t feel overly fatigued but didn’t experience a significant energy boost either. The flavor is quite bitter, but I mix it with a sweeter electrolyte mix, which works well for me.
Very disappointed. These shears couldn’t cut through two layers of gauze. As a nursing student, I expected better quality.
Noisy and ineffective. It just pulled at my cat's fur and upset him. The clipper guard was too long and didn’t even touch his fur.
I lift a lot at the gym and work, and this back support offers great help. It’s adjustable, so I can fine-tune the support when needed. It helps me sit up straight and may even help reduce waist size over time. I got it at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
It maintains sharpness and is reasonably priced.
I can't figure out how to turn the light on when I want it. The instructions were unclear, and the light is too bright at night. The nature sounds are annoying, and I wouldn’t recommend this lamp for gradual morning lighting.
The Dr. Paine pain relief cream didn’t work well for me. It absorbs quickly and has a slight menthol scent, but didn’t relieve my back pain. I prefer stronger creams like Ben Gay.
I’m new to wood repair kits, but this one worked well for covering scratches on furniture. It’s a bit tricky at first, but the result was satisfactory, making it worth the purchase.
This product works great. I thought it would be low quality due to the price, but it’s gentle on the skin, compact, and effective. Just remember to charge it before use.
The glasses arrived quickly and were well-packaged. They’re effective at reducing blue light, helping me fall asleep more easily. The magnification is just right, and I’m buying another pair for work.
This broth may not be salty enough for everyone, but it adds healthy benefits to soups. It’s much easier than making homemade bone broth and has organic ingredients. I’ve noticed benefits for my skin after regular use.
There is no surprise toy in the bath bombs—only egg-shaped toys. My nephew was disappointed by this.
I was disappointed with this back massager. The legs were uneven, and the wood coating was poorly applied. I would recommend spending more for a better quality product.
Great size for organizing. The four sections provide plenty of space, even if you have a lot of pills.
This scale is perfect! It arrived quickly and is accurate and well-made. I’m very satisfied with this purchase.
Its small size makes it easy to store in a purse or desk drawer. It works well.
Sneak beet nutrients into your food, and enjoy the flavor without the chewing hassle! A+ for convenience.
Inexpensive yet well-constructed. The ribbon to hang it is sturdy, making it a great value.
This product is fantastic! It removed road tar from my white vehicle after some effort with a microfiber towel. Highly recommended.
I inserted the orange earplugs and went to sleep. At 4am, I woke up with intense pain in my left ear. While trying to remove the plugs, the clear plastic nib detached from the left plug and stayed stuck in my ear, leaving me unable to remove it. For an hour, I tried unsuccessfully to get the plug out, causing a great deal of pain and concern about needing emergency assistance. The absence of the clear nib made it impossible to grip the plug, and tweezers didn’t help. At 5am, I asked my neighbor for help. After trying tweezers, we resorted to gently using a wooden toothpick to carefully extract the plug over the course of 30 minutes. After the ordeal, I felt exhausted, having lost five hours of sleep. This product is dangerous and should not be sold.
This pack is great for decorating smaller spaces like an entranceway. Although it didn’t include as many decorations as I anticipated, the mylar balloons were a big hit with the kids. Overall, it’s a solid choice for any Halloween celebration, and I’d recommend it for themed events or Halloween night.
Although these are not the most comfortable, they provide a better hold compared to the professional version.
This set is a great budget-friendly option if you’re looking to try cupping without a major investment. It offers a variety of size options and maintains good suction. Over time, however, the plastic cups show signs of brittleness and some have cracked. Despite this, the cups lasted well for their price, and the pump handle allows for good control over suction strength. If you’re just starting with cupping and don’t want to splurge, this set is a great choice. I’ve found cupping helpful for my shoulder pain, as it improves blood flow and breaks up adhesions.
These sponges are perfect for cleaning tight spaces and hard-to-reach areas like chrome around faucets. They excel in getting into nooks and crannies and are also effective on mirrors. However, they don’t last as long as traditional sponges, so it’s important to manage expectations. They’re ideal for detailed cleaning but may not hold up for long-term use.
It works exactly as advertised.
I have a sensitivity to clothing tags and seams, and this product has been a lifesaver. I can now wear clothes with tags without the discomfort.
I bought this for my wife, and she hasn’t mentioned any issues, so I assume it’s a hit.
While the ingredients are good, the gum doesn't stay in place well and turns into a sawdust-like texture that makes you want to spit it out. I wish they offered this in a gel or paste form for better consistency.
This product is as thick as the name-brand version and slightly more affordable than what you would pay in stores.
I purchased this set for the blades, as they were cheaper than buying them separately. I gave the callus shaver to a friend, and she is pleased with it.
I bought this as a gift for a family member for their new home, and they really liked it.
I’ve now used two boxes of this product, and it really enhances the flavor of my fermented vegetables. Following the recommended recipe with juiced celery and adding Himalayan salt makes the veggies taste amazing.
While it offers great magnification, the depth of field is too short for my computer use, so I returned it.
This product is very useful.
It works perfectly and is very well made.
I found a cinnamon mouthwash that works great for my husband, who loved cinnamon Listerine but it’s no longer available. He prefers this brand now because it has a good flavor with just the right amount of alcohol.
The product is beautiful but not exactly as shown. The picture had purple and pink, but I received all purple. It still looks nice, but I might add more silk flowers to mix things up a bit.
Highly recommend—great taste and great value!
I’ve had this unit for over a year, and it’s very quiet. Initially, I bought it to reduce cigarette odors from neighbors, and while it doesn’t eliminate the smell entirely, it does reduce it. Now, I use it near the cat’s litter box. It works, but it doesn’t completely eliminate odors. Using cat grass has proven more effective in this regard.
I didn’t experience any pain relief with this product, but it was soothing to massage in. My mom found it okay but didn’t ask for a refill, so it wasn’t a complete failure, but I wouldn’t purchase it again.
These bars are tasty and nutritious, offering good value for the price. They’re filling, but keep in mind they contain carob instead of chocolate, though they do have milk and peanut butter.
These boxes are perfect for presenting gifts. Made from sturdy white cardboard, they are easy to assemble and offer a nice sheen. They’re ideal for lightweight items but may not hold up for heavier gifts.
The quality is very poor.
The craftsmanship is beautiful, but the weather has made it challenging for me to spend time shopping. Still, I love it and use it during full moon rituals.
This bag exceeded my expectations for camping and travel. It accommodated all my camping gear while keeping everything dry. I used it in my Toyota Highlander, and with some extra precautions, it worked perfectly.
This product provides inaccurate readings and is not worth buying.
These pads are thick and high-quality, with great leak protection. I use them for my small dogs, and they’re the best I’ve found. However, they’re a bit pricey, and I wish they were larger.
My girlfriend used it on a burnt pot, and it worked well. After seeing the results, I decided to get one for myself.
I bought these socks for Nurses' Day gifts, and they were a big hit.
I’m a fan of aromatherapy, and this product has helped me relax and fall asleep. It’s convenient to use by simply spraying it on my sheets before bed.
The colors are vibrant and bright.
These coconut water drops have completely transformed my hydration routine. They’re perfect for my sugar-free lifestyle, although they’re a bit pricey and don’t last long. Still, they’re great for adding flavor without sugar.
These reusable period products are decent. They're easy to use and clean but a bit bulky. The black inner lining is a nice touch to avoid stains.
The dial on this scale is easy to read and works well for me, as it’s easier to step on than a digital scale. The only downside is that it reveals my true weight!
It’s easy to make!
I bought this for upper back pain, but the caution about rhythm disturbances was concerning. I won’t be recommending this TENS unit due to potential health risks.
Great quality, works perfectly, and just as advertised. I’ll definitely buy again.
Great tissues for cold and allergy season.
It’s just like what my grandmother used to use.
I used these decorations at my friend’s surprise party, and they were super cute. They were also reasonably priced, so I’m happy with my purchase.
This tarnish remover worked wonders on my silver cross. After following the instructions, the tarnish was gone in seconds. Highly recommend.
I always choose this brand for my tissues.
The product works great and is very well made.
This white noise machine is perfect for couples who struggle to sleep in silence. With numerous sound options, including waves, rain, and instrumental music, we found something that worked for both of us. It’s also a great addition with its multi-mode night light.
The product was supposed to include four rubber feet, but mine only came with one.
These paper towels are very absorbent and have a cloth-like texture, which I love.
These socks are well-made and provide great compression. At first, they feel a bit tight, but after a few wears, they become supportive without being overly tight.
This mirror is very clear and magnifying, perfect for any facial care routine or shaving.
I bought this kit to start incorporating aromatherapy into my routine, and it’s been great for stress relief and relaxation.
This bath mat provides a cozy, non-slip surface to step onto after a shower. It’s soft, comfortable, and easy to clean, with a fast-drying design.
This water filter has greatly improved the taste of my tap water, and I now feel much better drinking it.
This home decor item perfectly complements the style I was going for. It’s well-made and looks high-end.
I found this tool easy to use and effective for my baking needs.
I bought these earbuds for running, and they stay in place even during intense workouts. The sound quality is also great for the price.
This laptop table is very effective.
Why complicate a product that is simple to use? I followed the instructions but couldn’t get it to heat up. It may work well, but I lack the patience to figure it out, so I’m returning it.
This sponge seems like it would be the right fit for my wand, but unfortunately, it isn’t. I bought these in November, and after running out of my previous sponges, I grabbed a new one only to find that it doesn’t fit. The shape is correct, but the base is wrong. Since it's been over 30 days, I can't return them. It’s a hassle, so be sure to check both the shape and the base before buying.
Safe to use under adult supervision, as children might be tempted to step on it. It's fragile due to the glass material.
This product didn’t help smooth my foundation. If anything, it made my makeup look like I applied it with a plastic bag.
I enjoy this product. While I’m not certain about its health benefits, it tastes great and is a healthier alternative to many other water additives.
Let me start by saying that the packaging for this energy supplement is super cute, which initially drew me in. The name “Cherry Bomb” made me think the flavor would be great, but once I opened it and smelled it, I was completely turned off. It had a strange, strong scent that I couldn’t even describe. I braved a taste and regretted it immediately – it tasted like battery acid and stomach bile. Despite my hesitation, I drank half the bottle out of thirst, but I couldn't handle it. The taste lingered, and it was worse than I could imagine. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.
What a great presentation for a gift. However, I eat mostly vegan and don’t need to lose weight, so this doesn’t quite suit my needs. MCT oil is healthy, and I use it in my salads with plenty of seasonings. It’s tasteless, so many people use it in coffee or tea. I don't drink coffee but occasionally put it in smoothies. Although I think smoothies are a waste since they lack fiber, this MCT oil is fine in that context. It’s pricey, but the packaging is elegant and resembles a bottle of vodka.
These are poorly made. The sleeve doesn’t stay in place, and the foam inside is uncomfortable. There’s no cover on the foam, and I can't believe these have received good reviews. I’d recommend something like Futuro, which works much better for my ulnar nerve issues.
I’m happy with this product. I dislike bulky vitamins and remembering how many to take. This powder is fine, flavorless, and easily mixes with shakes, yogurt, or oatmeal. My only issue is that the resealable bag doesn't close well, so I transferred it to a different container. Otherwise, it’s a convenient way to add nutrients to my diet.
My husband and I use this product to relax and help with sleep. It works well, and we’ll be ordering again.
This is the third time I’ve purchased this product, but the sticks inside the bottle weren’t working. The sticks in the pouch worked fine, but unfortunately, 100 sticks in the bottle were useless upon opening.
Seems to be working without causing any jitters or teeth clenching. I appreciate that I can stop using it without crashing afterward.
I use this to make magnesium oil. I mix it with water in a ratio of 1 part water to 12 parts flakes. If you want it stronger, you can use equal parts. It’s best to store in a spray bottle, and it can also be used as a deodorant.
Very cheesy and crunchy, which makes it hard to stop eating once I start.
It arrived on time. A nice product with a clean scent.
Good quality and as advertised.
Before buying Australian Bush Flower essence, make sure to shop around for the best price.
I bought this stool to replace my plastic Sterilite stool, which cracked and became unsafe. This stool is heavy-duty, stable, and came fully assembled. It’s well-built with crossbars for added strength and has a non-slip surface. I'm glad I spent the extra money on this, as it seems like it will last a long time.
Works best on clean glasses. Nice packaging.
At first, I thought this hair dryer looked a bit old-fashioned, but after using it, I was impressed. It dried my hair much faster than my old dryer. The airflow is strong, and the high heat setting is very hot. It’s lightweight and easy to handle, and I hope it lasts a long time.
One tablet is enough for a cup of coffee. These are a bit sweeter than Splenda, and the container is small enough to keep in an office drawer. I’ve ordered more of the 1200-tablet containers for travel.
Great product. It holds well and makes showering possible, especially since an injury made it difficult for me to reach high places. I was able to adjust it to the right height for my use.
This is a natural allergy medicine that has worked wonders for me. I’ve been dog-sitting at a friend’s house with a long-haired dog, and Nettle has helped me breathe easily.
This product satisfies my craving for dark chocolate and raspberry. It has a good flavor, high protein, and fewer carbs. However, eating more than one a day may lead to digestive discomfort.
This probiotic seems to be well-formulated for women. After taking it for a week, I feel it’s helping with my digestive issues caused by post-viral inflammation, although the effect is hard to measure.
This is the best way to buy them in bulk.
The jade facial tools I received match the online photos, but the scraper and roller are significantly different in color. The scraper is polished and comfortable to use, but the roller is noisy because it lacks silicone plugs inside the cylinders. It still provides adequate pressure, but the clunking sound is distracting. At this price point, it’s a good option for someone new to these tools, but the color mismatch is a bit off-putting.
This denture bath is well-made, with a good design. It comes with three pieces: the lid, the basket, and the outer bin. The basket lifts out easily, and both my upper and lower dentures fit perfectly.
This product didn’t work for my curly, textured hair. My regular flat iron performs better at straightening and curling. It might work better for straight hair.
Life Extension products are slightly overpriced, but they work well for my needs. You get what you pay for.
This tool is significantly louder than my other foot scrubber. It took me a moment to realize I had to hold the power button down to turn it on. It comes with three heads to suit different needs and is waterproof, so it can be used in the bath or shower. However, it doesn’t come with an adapter, just a USB charging cord. A small bag to store the attachments would have been nice.
After surgery, I couldn't sleep with pillows over my head, so I tried this luxury silk sleep mask. Both my wife and I love it, as it comfortably fits our different head sizes. The material is soft and cool, though my wife found it a bit warm after a while. We both appreciate the way it blocks out light and softens surrounding sounds, improving sleep quality. The velcro is secure, and it has a nice, feminine look.
Approaching 50, I began noticing a decline in my focus and concentration. After just two doses over two days, I felt a significant improvement! I could stay focused on a project for over 10 hours without distractions. I'm beginning to feel more like my younger self!
No issues with them holding up.
The mask is soft, though I noticed some color transfer onto my pillows. I’m unsure why this occurred. Additionally, the plastic adjustment clasp on the elastic band tends to dig into the side of my head. There must be better sleep mask options available.
I’m thrilled to have found this product. After recently dealing with shingles and contact dermatitis (allergy), I tried the fragrance-free version. It cleans just like the Ultra Stain Release Original, but without the fragrance. Tide and Amazon continue to impress!
Looks great and seems solid.
A nice assortment packed in a box. For the price, it’s definitely worth it, offering a great selection of stones.
These pads are ideal for facial use, though they don't hold enough soap to clean larger body parts. The 3" x 2.5" size with soft silicone bristles is excellent for facial use, creating a nice lather. The only issue is that soap can seep onto the back, making the pad slippery. I hold it by the knob for a better grip. The scrubber with a sponge inside also works well, though the bristles are a bit firmer. It’s easy to squeeze and dries quickly, and the scrubber is a perfect size for use.
We use this to move my mom's wheelchair from the kitchen to the sunroom. It works perfectly and is very sturdy.
This product is excellent for removing thermal compound grease—way more effective than rubbing alcohol.
Cleaning gloves are a must in every household. These latex-free gloves are as high quality as Playtex and come in multiple colors, making it easy to color-code for different tasks. A great buy!
The smell wasn’t to my liking, so I gave it to a friend. I was hoping for a more authentic pine scent.
The product seems to whiten teeth, though it's in powder form, which takes some getting used to. I dampen my toothbrush, dip it in the powder, and brush my teeth—it's black, but it works well for thorough cleaning. A natural alternative to chemical-based products.
Initially skeptical about using Amazon cotton for vaping, I’ve found it to perform just as well as higher-end brands like Cotton Bacon Prime and Wotofo. It has minimal break-in time, lasts a long time, and delivers great flavor. Highly recommended!
I recently replaced the nose pads on my glasses with this 10-pack of D-shaped, screw-on silicone pads. They’re soft yet firm, and I plan to keep them as backups for future use. My daughter's parrots have already chewed through a couple, so I’m ready for more.
This sometimes helps with my nighttime leg cramps, though it’s not always effective. Still, it’s useful to have on hand.
A disappointing product—no power and a complete waste of money.
While well-built, the product's dimensions are just slightly off, limiting its usefulness.
After much research, I decided to try this foot file. It worked wonders for my feet, removing rough skin quickly without damage. It even worked on my husband's feet, and he was impressed too.
Pros: This set has every size brush you could need for cleaning combs, razors, and trimmers. They’re easy to clean too. Cons: I can’t think of any downsides—this kit is great!
Unfortunately, I couldn’t get these to work for me.
Broke faster than expected, making them disappointing.
These are great so far, although the shipping felt like it took forever. Once received, they were light, comfortable, and perfect for extended wear.
Easy to use with a decent flavor. Though I can’t tell if it works yet, I continue to take it alongside other arthritis relief products to maintain flexibility and reduce pain.
These gloves fit perfectly! The set includes both lined and unlined gloves, which I find ideal for various tasks. They provide excellent dexterity, and the reinforced fingertips add durability. I’ve tested them in several situations, from scrubbing metal cabinets to cleaning dirty pans, and they’ve held up perfectly. They’re also latex-free, making them suitable for those with allergies. Highly recommended!
This wash-in product helped restore the water repellency of my nylon shell jacket. While it didn’t make it fully repellent, it did a great job. There’s no residue or odor, and it doesn’t affect fabric breathability.
Unfortunately, this product ruined the shiny finish inside my vintage coffee pot while removing dark coffee stains. Not recommended for vintage items.
Great fit, looks good, and an excellent price.
The sound quality is decent—not Bose level, but good for the price. The battery lasts a few nights of sleep.
I’ve used battery-powered Emjoi foot files for years, but this one is more convenient and powerful. Be cautious, though, as it can grind too much skin off if used too aggressively.
So far, these capsules have been beneficial for my hair and skin. They also have antibiotic-like effects, which is a bonus. They're vegetarian, and with a two-capsule daily dosage, this supply lasts a month. A good supplement to consider.
The broccoli powder has a stronger smell than taste, but it's an easy way to add veggies to your diet. Perfect for smoothies or juices. It’s organic, non-GMO, and has no fillers. I just wish the product would clarify whether it’s raw or cooked and provide serving size details.
I used it once and then discarded it—it didn’t curl my lashes as expected.
Excellent flavor, and based on past use, it works well for soothing my upset stomach.
A great-tasting way to get vitamin C.
I've been using these sponges for years. They always clean well and easily reach my back. They don't mildew or tear and last for 3-6 months.
These air purifiers work perfectly in my car, leaving the air fresh.
This product does exactly what it claims, and at a great price. I plan to buy a couple more to have one for each room.
As described, this large storage bag is perfect for bulky items. It’s sturdy, and the window is a great feature.
Perfect for cleaning and sanitizing wounds.
These masks are by far the best I’ve tried in recent years. I can chew gum and talk comfortably while wearing them.
I like the idea of a bug repellent lotion. It’s exactly as described and arrived quickly.
These masks worked just as I needed them to. I’m happy with my purchase.
This soap dispenser doesn’t leak and works well for dishwashing. However, the sponge head comes loose from the plastic base after a short time. The seller is offering a replacement, but it's a hassle with the return process. Still, it performs better than the previous brand.
After testing several nutrition bars, these came second overall. They’re tasty, healthy, and not overly sweet—great for a healthy snack option!
A small amount of this product in my morning coffee works wonders!
This set includes two household chore gloves, one with a cotton lining and the other without. Both are sized large and fit comfortably, similar to a women's large. They are easy to wear, even the one without the cotton lining. The gloves offer flexibility, making them suitable for tasks requiring dexterity. They provide ample coverage for the hand, wrist, and part of the lower arm. I'm impressed with the fit, ease of wear, and that they don't trigger my latex allergy, something I often struggle with when finding gloves.
This product offers great value for the price. It's user-friendly and effectively cleans appliances.
Replaced the original part, and it fits perfectly. The only issue is the adjustment stem pins, which are not identical to the originals. However, I was still able to make it work.
This product held up remarkably well, even in windy conditions.
A fantastic product that I've been using for years, consistently delivering great results.
This product performs as expected and works well.
This cleansing brush system is outstanding. It comes with a stylish carrying case and features a large body brush, a blending brush for facial creams, a facial brush for deep cleaning, and a pumice stone. It operates on batteries, eliminating the need for multiple gadgets. I purchased it at a discount but would gladly pay full price, especially for a gift.
I bought this for my elderly father, whose feet are constantly aching. Blue Emu has been the only salve that provided him with relief. He loves it.
In my opinion, this product performs just as well as much pricier alternatives.
After using these daily for almost three weeks, I’ve noticed more energy throughout the day, whether I’m working or engaging in physical activity. The two-tablet dosage is convenient, and I’ve also found it helpful for reducing bloating from excess water retention. I only take them once a day, but the dosage can vary based on personal needs. No crash effect, and I feel more alert.
These bulbs emit a cooler, brighter light compared to standard soft white bulbs, enhancing readability. They are compact and have a quick turn-on time. However, the packaging is flimsy, and both the original and replacement shipments had a broken bulb. These bulbs contain mercury, so they should be ordered separately to avoid potential contamination from damage during shipping.
The product barely measures up to 16 inches, not the advertised 17 inches. Additionally, the washing element has started separating. It feels cheaply made.
Instead of easing my breathing, this product made it harder to breathe. I ended up returning it.
I received this eyelash curler charged, but it failed to heat up after being on for 10 minutes. It cracked while I was using it, and I cannot recommend it.
We’ve used the original Oreck carpet cleaner for years and have found it much more effective than any off-brand cleaners.
I received this item, but it won’t even turn on. It's frustrating to have to return it. Don't waste your money.
The item arrived securely packaged. I use this fragrance in my diffuser to enhance lavender and orange. The scent is just as expected and quite pleasant.
This product does the job well and meets expectations.
I absolutely love these colors!
I purchased this squeegee for cleaning shower tiles and the glass door, and it works excellently. The handle is adjustable, and it also has an extension handle. It came with two replacement blades, making quick work of drying the tiles and glass.
This iodine product is the only one I can tolerate. It helped me with my energy levels after a heavy metal detox, and my heavy metal levels have dropped significantly. I continue taking it daily to maintain my energy and overall wellness. It’s a staple in my supplement routine.
The product lacks clear instructions, and the adjustments are very limited. It doesn't appear durable or comfortable and doesn't provide much assistance with movement.
The scent of this product is absolutely heavenly! I initially bought one to test, and I’m now buying several more. If you’re purchasing from this brand, they usually offer free shipping on orders over $50, which is a great way to save on shipping costs.
These were exactly what I needed for detailed sewing work and helped significantly with threading needles.
This product works great.
It's good for the price.
This is a close alternative to jets. It’s easy to use and provides a relaxing effect. When rinsing, I hang it vertically to dry in the shower.
This product may remove the matte finish from paint, leaving shiny spots, and gradually removes the shine from tiles. However, it’s still a great tool for situations where nothing else works.
This product is pretty good, but I still experience some chafing during longer 10-mile runs. I’m preparing for a marathon, so I need something more durable for the sports bra area.
I used this product while recovering from walking pneumonia. Although I was still sick for a couple of months, it may be more effective as a preventative rather than for active illness.
These readers are stronger than my previous pair and are perfect for my craft work. The fashionable colors are an added bonus, and I keep a pair at work as well. They’re a handy spare and ideal for miniatures and handwork.
Great cases!
These low-carb snack bars are satisfying and soft, not hard or dry as I initially expected. While not quite a treat, they’re palatable and easy to eat, making them great for on-the-go or in your bag.
The brush is very soft and does its job, but it wasn't quite what I expected.
I used to use a warm washcloth for extractions, which was messy and inconvenient. This unit delivers steam that helps open pores for extraction and even includes extraction tools. So far, I’m pleased with it.
I take these with me when I travel. They're incredibly useful when I find myself in places with no soap or sink, such as during my trip to Namibia and Botswana. Just use one sheet per hand washing—two sheets is too much.
After seeing this oil recommended on Pinterest for scars, acne, and wrinkles, I gave it a try. It exceeded my expectations, and my skin has never looked better.
This is a great moisturizer. I’ve already seen improvement in my appearance, and I usually find it cheaper on eBay.
Update (Jan 2018): After years of dealing with black streaks on my bathroom floor from this scale's rubber feet, I finally gave up and threw it out. Cleaning, nail polish, and felt covers didn’t work. This scale is sleek, accurate, and easy to read, but the feet are problematic. I’ve since replaced it, though.
This product has been life-changing for me. I use it twice a day for eye and eyelid care and it has helped tremendously with my dry eye syndrome. I can't imagine living without it.
This cart is sturdy with a long handle for easy maneuvering. I gave it 4 stars because the wheels aren't durable enough for daily city use, but I replaced them with lawn mower wheels and now it’s perfect.
So far, this product has worked well. It charges my batteries so I always have a backup.
It’s okay. I only felt some tingling, but I got a different product, "The Bust-Boosting Solution," which has given me great results. Just thought I’d share!
Each mint contains 7mg of caffeine, but it feels much more potent. All the flavors are great, but I’m still deciding which one I prefer.
I have these on my Amazon subscription. Amazon claims they are tested, and I trust them based on my positive experiences with Amazon-branded products.
Exactly what I was hoping for! The scent is great.
This product is too hard and lacks the softer outer layer. My chiropractor recommended a similar one, but this version is missing the outer roll, making it unusable for me.
I appreciate that the straws come individually wrapped, especially since I don’t use bubble tea regularly. They’re the perfect size for bubble tea pearls.
These gloves work exceptionally well and are a time-saving, efficient way to dust mini blinds and knickknacks. The gloves are reversible for extended use and are machine washable (cold, gentle cycle) but must be air-dried. Highly recommended.
This higher dose of Omega-3 provides double the amount I used to take, and I’m glad I found it. I look forward to seeing the effects of this stronger supplement. Highly recommended.
I like the convenience of being able to carry one or all of these packets. However, the small handles for opening the packets may be difficult to use for people with stiff hands.
Like many others, I was surprised when I opened the bottle and noticed there was something unexpected inside.
It's functional, though it tends to dry out quickly.
After researching magnesium deficiency, I learned that it can have serious health consequences, such as heart attacks. However, many magnesium supplements can't be taken in high enough doses without causing digestive issues. I’ve tested different dosages of this product without experiencing any stomach cramps or diarrhea, making it a rare and valuable option in the supplement world.
I’ve used it once so far and it performed well.
The XXL size is just about big enough for someone who’s 6'7". Even so, it does help with aligning my back and shoulders correctly. I was concerned about the smell, but the vendor reassured me it would dissipate, albeit slowly in colder conditions, such as my garage during winter.
This is a great quality hair chalk with vibrant colors, perfect for my daughter and granddaughters who are into roller derby and enjoy experimenting with their hair for their bouts.
These are very cute and just firm enough to stuff without being too tough for kids to open.
I wouldn’t wear it.
I replaced an old Ace bandage with these, and although they may have improved over time, this set of four wraps with two clips each (plus extra clips) feels much better than my old one. The material stretches well, and as long as they hold up, I’d definitely buy again. If they don’t, I’ll update my review.
While I haven’t fully tested this product yet, I have high hopes for it. I still have a few weeks to assess its effectiveness in conjunction with other detox methods and dietary changes. However, after using it for two weeks with no success in my detox effort, I’m disappointed. The product didn’t deliver as promised, and now I’m relying on a different method before my test.
These probiotics are great! Each capsule contains 25 billion CFUs, and with 14 different strains, it has excellent diversity. I haven’t had any stomach issues like bloating or gas. The price is reasonable, and overall, it’s a solid product.
This essential oil roll-on kit contains four blends for relaxation, with a mix of vetiver, lavender, and peppermint. The scents are mild but pleasant, and the roll-ons are easy to apply. They’re a convenient way to enjoy the benefits of essential oils, making this set a thoughtful gift.
While this supplement contains high-quality ingredients, the pills are huge and difficult for me to swallow. I’d prefer a smaller pill with the same effective ingredients. Overall, it’s a good product, but the pill size makes it hard to recommend for daily use.
The capsules are easy to swallow and have no unpleasant taste.
It works, but the shape doesn’t hold for long.
I’m not sure if it’s working, but it’s plugged in next to the bed. It might be more of a mental effect. The larger version we have for the room definitely works.
This is easy to adjust and fits well, significantly improving my posture. The added resistance band and exercise link are nice touches.
Derma Nu’s toner has a lovely, subtle rose scent that’s fresh and natural. It’s gentle on the skin and works well for cleansing and toning, making it ideal for those with dry or sensitive skin. This toner is affordable and of high quality, consistent with the other Derma Nu products I’ve tried.
I’m excited to use this roller for my husband’s 40th birthday. The vibrant images on it look just like the pictures, and it’s going to be a fun and memorable part of his day.
These are great for satisfying mid-afternoon cravings in the office.
I’ve reordered these and tried other products from the same brand. The quality is consistent and excellent.
This soap is beautifully colored and has a sweet scent. I especially love the horse-in-motion design they’ve captured.
This walker bag is a nice, well-made addition. My mother-in-law loves it.
We’ve tried a few different types, and these are by far the best. The material is soft yet thick enough for pandemic protection. My son is a smaller 6-year-old, and while they’re slightly loose around his cheeks, they still fit well overall.
Initially, I thought this was too heavy, but after trying it, I found the weight is quite comparable to similar products. The cape-like design really helps distribute the heat where I need it. I’ve upgraded my review to 5 stars, though I’d prefer if the contents shifted around less, which could potentially be solved with internal sections.
I liked this powder; it’s exactly as described and arrived on time.
Unfortunately, these inserts were way too small for my size 12 feet and were very thin. I’d recommend spending a bit more on something like Odoreaters instead.
This product works wonders for cleaning the boat, effortlessly removing tough spots. It’s become my go-to cleaning solution.
The Mountain Falls Ultra Sunscreen is a great affordable alternative to pricier brands. It absorbs quickly, isn’t greasy, and provides solid protection when reapplied regularly. Overall, it’s a reliable, budget-friendly sunscreen.
This is perfect for our at-home tanning bed in our Cleveland Browns-themed basement!
My wife described the smell as “old man.” It’s not the best fragrance and is quite strong, but it does a good job preventing body odor.
These do exactly what they’re supposed to do.
The shaker is extremely practical, perfect for shakes, and even lets you store pills and protein powder. It’s a great size, easy to clean, and ideal for pre- and post-workout needs.
These gift bags are high quality, comparable to Hallmark, but at a much better price. Several feature a 3D aspect, and they come with a nice ribbon handle and attached gift tag.
This product is excellent at removing all kinds of organic stains, making it suitable for all ages. It’s not organic itself but works wonders on non-chemical stains.
These trash bags are stretchy and durable, fitting over a standard kitchen can with ease. They don’t have wire ties or flaps, so overfilling requires some effort to tie the bag, but otherwise, they work well.
I’m happy with the wood version of this item. It was easy to assemble and fits well. The design promotes proper posture, and I’m considering buying one for my mom as well.
It serves its purpose well. Overall, a good purchase. Would have preferred a longer handle.
A solid product with no complaints.
I use this for teaching patients self-mobilization exercises, and it works great. The band is wide and comes with a secure clasp.
This tool works excellently for removing dry skin from my feet. It’s perfect for diabetics and easy to clean, providing consistent results at an appropriate speed.
This large spray bottle works great for cleaning all my glasses, including my titanium ones. It arrived on time and was well-packaged.
I purchased this from my granddaughter’s baby shower registry. It’s perfect for sensitive baby skin and hypoallergenic, just as it was when I used it for my children many years ago.
The variety in this product is wonderful. It’s slightly larger than expected, but still great.
This travel toothbrush is exactly what I was looking for. It comes with an extra brush head, which is handy when traveling with my husband. The soft bristles are gentle, and the silver case is a nice touch. Cleaning is easy too, thanks to the included stick for clearing residual toothpaste.
This product is very practical.
The chicken flavor was disappointing, and to make matters worse, the product couldn't be returned. What a waste of money!
This set includes 12 individually wrapped bath bombs with various fragrances such as orange, lavender, frankincense, rosemary, mint, lemongrass, vanilla, seasalt, kiwi, rose, coconut, and papaya. I tried the papaya scent. Upon dropping it in the water, it fizzed out quickly without any noticeable suds, and the fragrance was barely detectable despite smelling nice in the package. The color stained my skin and towels but didn't affect the foot bath itself. These bombs underperformed, and at $19.99, they're not worth the price.
I purchased these noodles online and was pleasantly surprised when my husband and son liked them, even though they are used to more traditional pasta. The noodles have a thin texture, absorb the sauce well, and don't take on its flavor as much as other noodles like shiritaki. Each bag contains four servings, and they are high in fiber, making them a good option for a healthy meal.
For $11, it's decent, though I didn't use the adhesive it came with since it seemed unreliable. Instead, I used regular double-sided tape, which worked much better and saved time.
I appreciate the KF94 masks for their comfortable fit, especially since they suit my petite face well. The ear loops are smaller than most, which helps achieve a snug fit. However, the V-shaped cutout at the top of the mask doesn't work as intended for me, as it creates gaps on the sides, allowing air to enter. Overall, these masks are good for my needs but might not be ideal for larger faces.
This product helped with my recovery from surgery and performed as expected.
I was introduced to DMSO through my son’s running coach, who uses it for muscle pain. I now use it occasionally for knee pain. After applying, it leaves a sticky residue for 20-30 minutes, and the area becomes warm and itchy. Some users report a garlic-like taste in their mouth, and frequent use can lead to a garlic scent in your sweat. While I find it effective for pain relief, it’s important to apply it properly and with caution, as it can penetrate the skin and carry chemicals into the body.
It stopped working after a few months, making it a waste of money.
These are much more comfortable than the elastic bands that tend to hurt my ears after a while.
Nothing special about this pennant flag banner. It’s made of see-through plastic and doesn’t look as appealing as the image suggested.
The range of motion adjustment instructions were somewhat lacking, but I figured it out quickly. I ordered a medium size (I'm a men's size 9), but it was too big. The sole is quite thick, making walking uncomfortable for my specific injury.
These have been great! They're so comfortable that I occasionally forget to take them off.
I bought this pillow for pressure relief for my tailbone pain, but it’s too hard and uncomfortable for prolonged sitting. The large size is too bulky for my chair, and the square sides dig into my legs, preventing me from sitting properly. It doesn’t provide the support I was hoping for.
Hilarious! The paper quality is excellent too!
The Mesima product is exceptional. I plan to encapsulate some or use it as tea. I’m taking it for my brain tumor and seizures, and I appreciate the company’s dedication to quality. It's a great product, and I'm grateful for it.
During our trip to Asia, I bought this product to protect my kid from mosquito bites. It worked really well, with a mild scent that wasn’t overpowering.
Perfect for travel and everyday medication use. Well-made and easy to use.
These grooming tools worked great on my little dog, especially when groomers were unavailable. The set arrived promptly and included extra scissors and a nail file, making it a great bargain.
The small leaves create less mess, but it’s not as effective at preventing razor bumps.
This is the best pot holder I've ever used! The available colors are great too.
I was initially skeptical, but I fell for the commercial. This eraser is a disappointment. It disintegrates easily and doesn't clean effectively, even on tough stains. It's a waste of money, and I regret buying it. Stay away from this product!
I ordered these crutches for my sister, and they’re far superior to the more expensive ones she bought elsewhere. They’re comfortable, and she’s able to walk much easier now.
I like this product, but it would be better if it had a suction feature to stick to the shower wall.
This didn’t keep odors at bay for long, unfortunately.
I've been using this product for two weeks, but I don't have much to report yet. I'll update after 30 days.
It gets the job done, but I have to use two at once for any real coverage. I wish the company would just make larger sizes.
The Lemon Lime Sport Go Electrolyte powder is high in carbs (36g per serving), which makes it great for athletes needing energy during long-distance activities. For non-athletes, it’s useful for rehydrating when sick or after being in the sun for too long.
The rolls are smaller than expected, but the toilet paper itself works fine.
I prefer the creamy version of this over the gel one. DMSO has helped me stay off knee braces for almost two months now, except on particularly active days.
I find this neck pillow very comfortable on flights, although my husband doesn’t like it as much. I prefer it to traditional neck pillows.
My daughter loves this product!
The outfit didn’t fit as nicely as I hoped, but for the price, it’s acceptable.
This is the worst razor I’ve ever used. It couldn’t even cut peach fuzz. I would never buy from this brand again.
I bought this to remove fuzz from my fleece leggings, but none of the attachments worked for that. However, it worked well on my wool sweaters, so I’ll keep it.
This product is exactly like what I used at my physical therapist's office and works perfectly.
I ordered a 60-count but only received 30. I should have ordered directly from the brand instead.
I love journaling, but the pages in this journal feel rough and scratchy, like sketchbook paper. It’s fine, but not my favorite.
These didn’t work well for me. They slide around and don’t stay in place, especially on heavy days. The stains come out with washing, but they’re not reliable.
This product was poorly made. It fell apart after just two days.
This didn’t work on my teeth and just made them sensitive.
I was concerned when I first received this, as the powder smelled strange. However, it works as expected once you get used to the scent.
As someone who regularly uses sleep masks, I’ve tried numerous brands and styles, but this one stands out as the most comfortable. The soft, lightly padded material feels gentle on my eyes, and the light-blocking feature works perfectly when adjusted. The strap’s metal buckle is placed away from my ear, unlike most masks, preventing discomfort while sleeping on my side. It’s pain-free and ideal for side sleepers. I’m tempted to buy a few more as backups for when this one wears out!
These are ineffective. They don’t fly at all and barely spin, even when an adult tries to make them work, so I can't see how they would be enjoyable for a child.
Due to health concerns, I need to ensure I’m getting enough protein, and this product has been a fantastic addition. I’ve made a frozen mixture that I keep on hand, and it boosts both the protein content and the flavor. It’s now one of my favorites!
I’m really enjoying the Twix-flavored protein. The collagen powder adds a smooth texture, though you’ll need a blender for best results. The flavor is satisfying on its own, but adding a bit of banana or peanut butter can make it feel more like a milkshake. Either way, I think you’ll find it delicious.
Unfortunately, this scale doesn’t work as expected. It doesn’t "lock on" to the weight after measuring. I considered returning it, but the shipping cost isn’t worth it for a replacement.
The nose pads slip around quite a bit, and they’re too large for comfort.
This product was very irritating to my scalp, so I ended up discarding it.
This callus remover tool is by far the best I’ve used. It comes with 80 sanding pads, each of which lasts several uses. I tried it for the first time last night, and my feet are incredibly soft. I’ve used chemical callus removers, foot rasps, and manual sanders, but this tool outperforms all of them. My heels are as soft as a child’s! The pedicure places use it too, but they spend only a few seconds on your feet. I used it longer on tough areas, and it worked wonders. Well worth the money.
This is an excellent addition to nearly any bakery mix. It pairs especially well with Capella Popcorn flavor.
This product does exactly what it promises. I love it so much that I’m going to order another one right now.
This is a lot of fun!
The fit is great!
After years of using a prescription TENS unit, I wasn’t sure if this one would measure up, but it’s amazing! It’s even better than my previous one.
These gloves are durable for moderate use. I use them for various tasks around the house, including cleaning and kitchen work. The fit is perfect, and they work well for me compared to other brands.
My daughter updated her room, and these look fantastic on her dresser!
Exactly as advertised. It’s easy to use and works well.
This is the fourth similar product I’ve tried. Two of them didn’t work at all, one gave minimal results, but this one is incredible! I’m on my second order, and it works as advertised every time. I’d give it six stars if I could!
I’ve tried many jojoba oils, and this one is by far the best. It helped reduce discoloration on my arm. The packaging was excellent, and delivery was faster than expected. I’ve already recommended this oil to my friends.
It’s easy to use, tastes good, and works great. I use it daily at work.
I’ve been using this for over a week, and it seems to be helping with my regularity. I can’t speak to weight loss just yet, but it’s definitely beneficial for my digestive system. No discomfort or side effects for me so far. Everyone’s body is different, so your results may vary, but for the price, it’s worth trying.
I’ve used the pour-on version of this for years on my commercial-type gas stove. It’s amazing! What used to take hours now only takes minutes. The key is not to use water because it deactivates the chemicals. I learned this the hard way. Now that it’s available on Amazon, it’s a no-brainer for me. Five stars!
This is so easy to use and perfect for keeping wet hair up and out of the way.
These bath bombs came beautifully packaged and would make a fantastic gift. They’re surprisingly large and made my bath feel luxurious. I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues. The only downside was that my skin attracted some chiggers at the fair afterward. But they were jacuzzi-safe, and I plan to use more in the future. Five stars!
I like that it’s natural and helps curb my hunger with just three a day. I’m eating healthier now!
I’ve been taking these capsules for a few weeks. They’re on the larger side, but easy to swallow with no odor. They’re vegan and free of preservatives. They’re made in the USA, and I’ve seen that they’re tested for quality, though I’d love to see them certified by NSF.
Works great. My dad is very pleased with it.
Great price and perfect fit for masks with filter inserts. The materials and style provide extra protection. Highly recommend.
So easy to use, and I love the catch basin that holds the leftover pill parts.
This is perfect for those who have difficulty bending over to put on shoes. The telescopic handle locks in place and stays secure until you’re ready to fold it.
This is the second keychain of this style I’ve owned, and I prefer this one. It’s made from a neoprene-like fabric that stretches better than the canvas style, reducing stress on the zipper. It comes with 8 amber vials for essential oils, and they fit perfectly. I definitely recommend it for carrying oils on the go.
After about 100-200 swings, the cuts start to tear apart. Also, the mat lacks enough weight to stay in place properly. I’ll invest in a larger, heavier-duty practice mat next time.
It smells great, and I love the towel. Thank you!
I really like this product. I’ll definitely buy it again when I need to.
This product is okay for covering your eyes, though it’s a bit small.
These nail files are beautiful, but it’s hard to tell which side is rough and which is fine. They still get the job done.
It passes the freeze test, so it seems good. I’ll wait for the blood test results to know how well it works.
I add this product to everything from smoothies to oatmeal, even pumpkin custard, for an extra protein boost. I highly recommend the Paleo Egg White Protein.
I use Dial soap because it’s the best at fighting odor, especially in the hot, humid Southern weather. It leaves me feeling clean and fresh, and the Mountain Fresh fragrance is my favorite, though it’s hard to find.
These batteries last longer than most CR123 batteries.
Everyone loves it! I bought it for my son’s wheelchair, and everyone who sees it wants to try it. It’s affordable and has been a great alternative while we wait for insurance to send a new cushion.
Works great for legs too!
The perfect size for travel!
This case is pretty good. It’s sturdy and well-made, though I wish there was more headroom above the bottles for papers or reference books. I’m also wary of using the handle because I’m afraid the bottles might leak.
As a certified aromatherapist, I’m always on the lookout for fraudulent essential oils. The price should have been a red flag, and the smell of this sandalwood oil is off. It also failed the oil blot test. Using these oils is dangerous since they likely don’t offer the therapeutic benefits you’d expect. Avoid it.
While I don’t get mosquitoes where I live, I do get bites from other insects like chiggers, beetles, and ants. Unfortunately, this product didn’t help with the chigger bites, but it did ease the itching from other insect bites.
I found this product difficult to use at first, but I hope I’ll get used to it.
So far, this wrap isn’t working well for me. It’s comfortable and well-made, but the instructions are confusing, and I barely feel any heat after using it for 30 minutes. I’m going to look for a better one. After continued use, I’ve adjusted my rating. I’ve figured out how to use it more effectively, and it provides a comfortable, soothing heat now.
The price caught my attention, but after using it, I noticed water leaking slowly from the side. I’m not sure if it’s a defect or if it’s a common issue, but other than that, it’s cute, and we love it.
These might work fine for you, but if I apply too much tension on the strap, the mask slips off.
This guide works great without tugging, and the color is perfect—it’s not too dark.
This product failed to perform on any of the items I tried it with.
To be honest, it works. For everything that magnesium is essential for, it does the job, especially given its higher dose. Since most of us are magnesium deficient, a higher dose is definitely beneficial.
The high price kept me from buying it for years, but after finally putting it on the most used lamp, I’m so glad I did! It made a significant difference for my arthritic fingers. Now I can turn the lamp on and off without any pain. Definitely worth the investment.
This planter is fantastic! I attached it to my fence with zip ties, and even in the Texas heat, my dill and potatoes are thriving.
This shaver is surprisingly good for its price. The kit comes with: 1. Rotary Nose Trimmer, 2. Eyebrow Trimmer & Comb, 3. Shaving Head, 4. Beard & Sideburns Trimmer & Guard, 5. Cleaning Brush. After testing each accessory, they all worked as expected. My husband found the nose trimmer effective and gentle, and I had a smooth shave with no bumps using the shaving head. The eyebrow comb was easy to use, too. It’s compact, making it great for travel. The heads are easy to switch, and the unit requires one AA battery (not included). This is a good buy and seems to be made of quality materials.
This cushion helps with my callus and stays in place. It’s easy to clean and very durable.
I usually prefer using my bento box and glass containers, but these Solimo Plastic Food Storage Containers are surprisingly good. They’re sturdy, have secure lids, and hold up well with multiple uses. The price is also great, about 90 cents per container, making it a solid option for those who need reliable storage.
This motion sickness medication is the most effective I’ve used. I always take it when cruising.
These silk sleep masks are soft and stay on comfortably without being too tight. I use them when traveling to block out light and indicate that I don't want to be disturbed. They do a great job of blocking light.
This product works quickly and effectively removes wrinkles from my clothes, which I never bother ironing.
This set was adorable and looked perfect on my sister-in-law! The jeweled safety pin for the sash was the perfect finishing touch.
This product was frustrating. It didn’t fit my hair dryer, so I had to cut it to make it fit, but then it kept falling off my head. After 30 minutes of struggling with it, I gave up and used a plastic bag instead. I can't return it now, but I’m very disappointed.
These work fine for me at the gun range.
This lumbar support is a great addition to my computer chair!
Simple design, great price.
After installing Provenza oil-finished floors, I use this product as recommended by the manufacturer. However, it’s quite pricey, and it separates easily, requiring a lot of shaking. It’s a bit of a workout every time I use it. I’m hoping to find a more affordable alternative.
This product didn’t work at all for extracting blackheads. It didn’t seem to do anything, no matter how many layers I applied. It was basically just sticky and smelled like glue. Save your money.
These ice strap packs are much thicker and last longer than the ones I had before. They stay frozen longer and are a great improvement.
I used these as cake dowels and they were much easier to cut than wooden ones.
This portable nebulizer is very convenient. It works quickly, producing a fine mist, and is much easier to use than my large nebulizer. It comes with a USB cord for charging, making it travel-friendly.
This is a fun way to curl your eyelashes, but just be careful!
Who doesn’t love petroleum jelly? This one is great—no scent and a good price. Highly recommend it.
I tried these on a whim and followed the directions. They seem to do the job as a cleanse.
Great product, very soft.
I gave this one star because it didn’t catch all my sweat, and it never stayed on my head. I think the concept is good, but it didn’t work for me.
These are the first LED bulbs I’ve bought, and they’re a great investment. They fit perfectly in the ceiling fan sockets and give off more light while using less power than CFLs. The small size fits well in the diffuser globes. Although LED bulbs are a bit expensive, these have been reliable, and I’m happy with them. They should pay for themselves in a couple of years.
Comfortable to wear with sandals.
Two layers, so it meets workplace requirements.
This has a very relaxing scent. Plant Therapy is a quality brand.
My grandson loves dinosaurs, and these bath bombs make bath time fun, plus he gets a dinosaur prize!
These are great for my high arches. They come with padded pieces for height adjustment, allowing me to customize the fit for my shoes. They stay in place and work well for long periods of wear. I’ll likely buy these again.
These makeup removal pads are great. The solution is gentle, and the pads work well for removing makeup, even around the eyes. They smell pleasant and are reasonably priced. A great option for sensitive skin.
I got this nasal aspirator as an alternative to a regular bulb. It worked okay, but I didn’t find it any more effective than using a tissue to wipe my daughter’s nose.
It works okay with a lot of soap, but without it, it drags and doesn’t produce many bubbles. The eye hook makes it easier to hold onto when it’s slippery.
Used these at band rehearsal, and the sound was clear but at a lower volume. They help reduce ear ringing and are discreet, making them a great option for ear protection.
The scent of this product has changed from a soft baby powder smell to something strange and unpleasant. It no longer gives my daughter’s clothes the soft scent it used to. I’m sticking with Tide Free & Clear from now on.
This product has been great for treating psoriasis and calming itching. It’s also worked well for my dog with skin issues. Since using it, I’ve only needed to take her to the vet for an allergy shot once.
This product works well for shoes that are a bit larger. However, if your shoes fit well, it may cause pressure in certain areas.
This Amla powder is exactly what I expected. It’s USDA Certified Organic, Vegan, Gluten-Free, and Non-GMO. It comes with a scoop and mixes well in smoothies or juice. I’m satisfied with this product.
These Saturix Prep & Spill Pads are great for cleaning up messes without introducing lint. They’re durable and resistant to mild solvents like isopropyl alcohol. These pads are exactly what I needed for my clean prep work.
I bought these as a gift, and although I thought they were odd, they were worth trying.
This has a nice light scent, perfect for a relaxing bath after work.
I really like this eyelash curler. I use it before applying mascara, and it makes my eyes look more open.
I got this for a family member, and since he asked for more, I assume he’s happy with it.
I was excited about the roségold eyelash curler, but it arrived in a cheap plastic box that was bent. The product didn’t look as high-quality as the picture, and I was disappointed with it.
So, to start, I understand that isn't the most conventional use for the product but it really works! The first picture is the start of my shingles flare-up. My dad typically uses this product for joint pain but he suggested that I use this on the shingles. I got it quickly from Amazon and slathered a thick layer of the gel onto the painful, liquid-filled blisters and bumps. I will admit that upon application it burns and tingles but not so bad that it's unbearable. After a few days, the blisters started to dry out (a good thing for shingles because it means it's healing), and after about a week of application to the area, the blisters dropped considerably in size and the bumps were almost completely gone. I will admit, as others have, that the only drawback I could see is that it is very drying. I noticed that the skin around the bumps and blisters got flaky and dried out. I wanted this product to dry the blisters so just be wary if you're using it for pain relief, etc.
This did things to an old rug I thought not remotely possible - including not animal-related spots! I extremely highly recommend.
This weighted pencil holder is not a bad product. The grip on it is large, so if your kid is more comfortable with a bigger pencil to grip, it's got that covered. The outer portion isn't squishy, it's sort of a sandy grip, which isn't a bad thing either. The trouble is that you need to attach this using a tiny allen wrench to tension the grip onto the pencil, which means that you have to have the wrench out EVERY TIME THE PENCIL NEEDS SHARPENING. My boys mash their pencils into the paper, resulting in many broken pencil tips. The allen wrench never gets put away, greatly increasing the likelihood that it'll be lost. There has to be a better way to make this grip adhere to the pencil, but other than that, it's a great device for helping kids that need this kind of aid. BE ADVISED: This listing was not for the kit, I only purchased (as per the listing) the deluxe grip third from the top. It's a bit pricey for what you get, and I've found a better option, so you might want to see if you can find this locally so you can have a look at it before you buy.
This product helped me to have bowel movements without my stomach cramping up.
Only bug spray we will use! Keeps the bugs off us in the deep woods.
Love these containers!! Will buy them again for sure!!
I'm a big shopper of silly cheap gadgets and this seemed too good to be true... but I gotta say it works!! Made wiping down and cleaning my microwave much easier after using it! Would suggest for anyone who's like me and forgets to clean the microwave often and finds an inch thick worth of gunk to clean off.
I use this so I can hear my iPhone ring over all the equipment running in my shop. Works great, can be turned up to a very loud ear-piercing setting. Just what I needed.
The beautiful aroma of roses stays on your mat—faintly, not overwhelming. Very easy to use, spray on cloth, wipe it down, let it dry. All natural, which I love, and will not harm your mat! A great product for your cherished Yoga mat. I would highly recommend this product.
Wow, I like the colors and the quality is good!!
No complaints about the formulation of this probiotic. It hits the mark for both potency (25 billion CFUs) and strain diversity (a total of 10 strains: 8 Lactobacillus and 2 Bifidobacterium strains). The specific strains are listed on the bottle, but not the specific concentration of each. It delivers the 25 billion CFUs with a serving size of only 1 capsule (2 caps are the more common situation), making this bottle of 30 caps a month's supply. The downside is the price. There are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same (or sometimes better) potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a month's supply. While the formulation is solid, the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars (average). Equally good options are available that are a much better value.
This was useful when I had it. Gave me an effective way of straightening my hair without burning my skin off!! Lol heheh... Anyway, now I just don’t have as much of a problem with my hair being curly so I don’t need this as much. But I keep it in case I need to straighten my hair for an event or occasion because I don’t want to go back to normal straighteners. So glad this exists!
They are comfortable and fit well and good price.
Large enough for a few days worth of toiletries. Dries quickly, zipper is excellent quality.
Received them today, my husband uses them every day as he has had multiple back surgeries. His last one has lasted for a few years and is pretty worn out. Came on the day as promised.
The herbal infusion’s strength killed any odor on the pad. Also, the remedy gave a cooling sensation. I would love to exclusively use this brand.
Makes granite look good and very smooth after cleaning.
Great product.
I got these for my wife who said they cut like butter. No jagged edges. They cut smoothly and you barely have to press down on the lever. You’ll never buy the cheapo CVS Walmart ones again. Spending this much on nail clippers? You would be crazy NOT to! I don’t think we got fake ones. This is a high-quality machine. I’m already ordering the bigger one.
Not bad, but I think being that my foot is small, it rides up so I find myself pulling it down. But when I do that, it doesn’t cover my fore toe, but I will continue to use it because I need to see if it works better. It’s only been 1 day, so I will update later.
I have trouble sleeping, and magnesium seems to help. This package of individually packaged doses makes it easy to consume magnesium in liquid versus tablet or capsule form. It has the potential to be more potent as it gets into your bloodstream more quickly. I also like the taste (a bit sweet). While I appreciate the convenience of having each dose pre-measured for me, the doses come in these small plastic vials. To get out the entire liquid, I found myself biting down on the plastic vial itself as if it were candy (and indeed, these vials remind me of the candy soda pop vials that kids swilled by biting off the wax top and then drinking the sugary liquid inside). It's kind of wasteful but I can't deny they're convenient. Great for travel but not great for the environment.
I have about 4 different kinds of medicine and this is perfect. Before I bought this, I would dig through my purse looking for different bottles, but now I just look for my little grey box and everything is right there. It has never come open on its own, which is also a plus.
Great Workout Capris. They are a little thicker than expected, and the material dries a little slower than other pairs I have in different brands but great for running. Easy to move in these capris breathable material. There is a lot of stretch to these. If anyone is trying to figure out their proper size, I am 5'10" 162 lbs Waist: 32" Hip: 39".
You would think every pain relief cream is the same. I guess that is what I thought, but I was wrong. In the beginning, I would use BenGay. You can get it at every store, and it works. I like the smell of pain relief creams. The menthol smell actually is relaxing in itself for me. BenGay works for us. But then, at the chiropractor, I started using BioFreeze. I guess I should back up a little: My husband has scoliosis, so his back always hurts. Personally, I have a neck injury (including a spur), a mid-back injury from a car wreck, so I have a lot of scar tissue under my shoulder blades. I have also just been diagnosed with arthritis in my foot. I probably have it in my knees and elsewhere, going to a rheumatologist in a few weeks. Anyway...I guess what I am trying to say, we have pain. We are both pretty active, don't like to take a lot of meds, but like most, do not like pain. Who does? So, Biofreeze, I like BioFreeze, you can get it in a big pump bottle. It is more of a gel and spreads okay, it just seems like I have to use a lot. IcyHot, I had to buy that, we were running out of BioFreeze and the store didn't have BenGay. IcyHot is 'okay'. It is hard to spread, and it seems like you have to use a lot of product. Now RELIEFOR. I honestly like it. I had a chance to try it for a discount in exchange for an honest review. I am glad I did. I like the consistency. It is not a lotion, not a gel. It is a light blue liquid cream and spreads so nicely. I used it on my husband's back and it spreads around so easy. He said it didn't feel as 'hot' as others he has tried, but I had also just given him an alcoholic beverage and he was feeling pretty relaxed. Me...I tried it on my neck and shoulder, knee, and foot. I like it. It brought relief. It brought warmth. It was easy to put on and absorbed well and is non-greasy. I would like to look and see if they carry bigger sizes. I would buy this again. It is probably my favorite out of all the creams I have tried. Really! So, I recommend trying it and seeing for yourself.
Loved the product. Just don't think I will order that particular size again. Too big! The adhesion and fit were perfect.
Thank you! I love this product! Would definitely recommend it to anyone needing to send photos and images quickly in a simple format.
The product offers a comfortable fit and blocks light effectively, though it does sit slightly close to the eyes. I use it nightly and appreciate its performance.
I purchased this to address nerve pain, especially sciatic pain. It has a smooth, creamy texture that blends well into the skin. While it didn't alleviate my nerve pain as effectively as magnesium salt baths, it did help with muscle discomfort. For the price, I'd recommend sticking with magnesium salts for this specific issue. Shipping was quick, and the seller provided great service.
These are thick and comfortable right out of the package. I use them in my medical boot to add comfort since the inserts in the boot are flat and lack cushioning. After two days of use, they’re holding up well.
It’s just like visiting a hygienist 😁
I’m really happy with this spray cleaner! It has a lovely scent and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. I look forward to trying other scents once I finish the peppermint one.
Fantastic product! It delivers a great workout, and I have no regrets about purchasing it.
The scale performs well for the price. However, it shows slight variation in weight (about 2 pounds) depending on where it’s placed on the kitchen or bathroom floor. When I used it at the doctor’s office, the readings were consistent.
I’ve never been disappointed with this brand, and their Gua Sha stones are no exception. The rose quartz is smooth, well-packaged, and easy to use. Quality more than makes up for the simple packaging.
This is an innovative medicine dispenser – turn the knob, and the medicine comes out. I use it for back pain and neuropathy in my feet, and it works well.
These helped somewhat with dry eye relief, but not enough considering the price.
These capsules are great at keeping bloating at bay. Their size is medium, making them easy to swallow, unlike some oversized pills. A solid product overall!
My bottle arrived without a lid, which was disappointing because it’s now prone to leaking if carried in my bag. The product itself works fine, but packaging and shipping could have been better.
The scent doesn’t resemble lemon essential oil at all—it smells artificial. I should have been cautious about purchasing such a large bottle at such a low price.
I’m very happy with this product and would definitely purchase more.
I was shocked by how much dead skin was removed after using this. After just a few minutes, it felt like I had brand-new feet. I haven't fully tested the nail part yet, but the results for my feet were fantastic. Highly recommended!
This scale is accurate and user-friendly. It’s perfect for weighing my quadriplegic husband without needing to go to a vet’s office. Simple and effective!
I had a few issues with this product. First, it made me feel nauseous. Second, there’s no scoop, but I found two tablespoons equal enough. Third, the safety seal was broken. Lastly, it doesn’t dissolve well and clumps up. While the taste is good, it doesn't compare to others in the market.
This vegetable glycerin is great for food use—it's pure, sweet, and doesn’t cause tooth decay. I use it in homemade soaps and love how it keeps my skin hydrated. I’m definitely buying more!
I was eager to try this sea moss after hearing so much about it. Unfortunately, it had bits of plastic, likely from nearby textile factories, which I couldn’t remove entirely. Additionally, it came with a warning about chemicals known to cause cancer, which makes me concerned about its source. Research thoroughly before buying!
The scent of fresh air is delightful!
These mats are thick, sturdy, and seem built to last for many years. I’m very pleased with the quality, and they arrived quickly.
I bought several of these bandages for our crew to try out, and they are the real deal—just like the ones we get from our regular supplier, but at a better price. The quality is excellent, and they work great for our drills.
I was surprised at how well this cleaned. It removed grease from difficult spots. I would’ve liked it a bit larger, but it works wonders when combined with cleaner or soap.
I use this to keep dust out of my nose while changing the catbox. Although I’m not sure of its scientific effectiveness, it certainly reduces irritation. I prefer it to disposable masks.
This piña colada-flavored protein drink is delicious! It truly tastes like a piña colada. I was disappointed to discover it contains sucralose, which doesn’t sit well with me, so I won’t be finishing it. It would be helpful if the product listing included all ingredients.
This is perfect for travel.
These shoes are a bit big for me, but they work fine for indoor use. The included adjustable cord lock helps with sizing. The heat is mild, just enough to warm your feet without causing sweating. I like them for lounging around the house but wish the heat was stronger.
This critter chaser is the best one I’ve tried. It’s easy to install and louder than others. Bonus: it comes with instructions for maintenance and battery replacement. I’m eager to see how long the rechargeable batteries last.
These refills seem to have come from a defective batch. The spray isn’t working properly, and it’s leaking from the bottom of the nozzle. This looks like a manufacturing issue.
This product offers excellent foot support.
I love these socks! They work really well and are perfect for wearing around the house.
After trying several brands, this one provides solid arch support (4cm of reinforcement) for my high arches. It helps alleviate my recurring plantar fasciitis pain. The plastic EVA material doesn't deform, ensuring consistent support.
The product meets the description provided.
When my baby experiences congestion, I apply this to her feet, and by the next morning, she's feeling much better!
Doesn't clean well... I had to try multiple ounces before it worked as expected.
Very difficult to use. I didn’t notice any change in curl. A manual curler works much better. Not sure why drying power and flavor were even mentioned? 😂
I’ve been using a Quip toothbrush for travel over the years, but I don’t think it cleans that effectively and it only has one speed. You can replace the battery easily, but this Sonic Toothbrush is a game-changer! With five modes and three speeds, it claims to last 30 days on a single charge. It comes with a convenient case and really does a better job at cleaning my teeth. I can feel a clear difference in how clean my teeth are compared to my Oral-B toothbrush. I’m looking forward to seeing how it affects my dentist checkup. Only deducted a star because the package didn’t include instructions, and the charging base doesn’t fit in the travel case. Also, while it doesn’t come with a USB block, I think most people already have one.
Bulky and too thick for my liking.
The Capella Flavor Drops Gingerbread Concentrate tastes mediocre. There’s an artificial aftertaste, and while it smells nice, the flavor is weak and only somewhat resembles ginger. It's not bad, but I wouldn’t buy it again.
It's decent for my injuries when I'm in the shower. I need something a bit more abrasive. It's good for daily use to keep skin soft, but friction can irritate the skin, so I rinse with cold water to prevent any rash.
I’ve only used Crest strips for whitening before, and these don't compare. They don’t stick to my teeth as well, and I had to keep adjusting them. I did notice a slight improvement in whiteness, but at a much lower price than Crest, these might be a good option if you're on a budget.
I like the idea behind these vitamins to keep me feeling good during practice and help with flexibility. I’ve only been using them for a few days, but I already feel positive effects and recommend giving them a try.
This straightener and curler is okay. I didn’t find it superior to my current one. My granddaughter uses it just fine, even though she has thick hair like mine.
My daughter loves it!
There are red lights all around the collar’s interior, with an infrared heat coil over the spine. It’s easy to slide the collar into place, and it heats up quickly. The lowest heat setting is quite warm, and the collar allows me to adjust its position without burning my neck. Overall, I’m happy with this product; it covers the neck well, unlike most red light devices.
I regret not paying more attention to the other reviews. This product is very unstable, and putting it together was extremely difficult. Given its low manufacturing cost and high markup, I’m disappointed with the value.
The product description was incorrect. It claimed compatibility with my brush, but it wasn't.
I loved how my skin felt after using this. No unexpected reactions on my sensitive skin.
These inserts were a lifesaver for my wedding. After breaking them in, I used them on the big day and never had to worry about my heels slipping off. I walked through gardens, rocky paths, and climbed hills with no issues. If you need something to keep your heels in place, these are perfect!
I got these for my husband, who wears a mask at work. They worked wonders for relieving the pressure on his ears.
I really like the combination of ingredients in this supplement. The dosage per capsule seems low, so I take two. It doesn’t upset my sensitive stomach, and I’m noticing better appetite control, which I attribute to taking these pills regularly.
Exactly what I was looking for! The curling iron has adjustable settings for heat and time, is easy to use, and the curls last.
The product was fully charged when tested.
I’ve been using this pillow for over 10 years after a whiplash injury, and it’s the only one I’ll use. It helps with neck pain, and I buy a three-pack every two years to replace them. Great value!
One end of the brush is the same as a regular toothbrush, while the other end is smaller. I switched to using my finger for better control.
These are so delicious and flavorful! They’re not overly vinegary, like hot sauce, and are great for dipping or adding flavor to anything.
Exactly what I ordered, and it arrived promptly.
These hair trimmers are impressive! They cut my hair efficiently, leaving it smooth and even. The motor is powerful, and the blades are sharp without irritating my skin. Definitely better than most others I've used.
Good product, but use with caution on silver jewelry. Test a small area first and don’t leave jewelry immersed for long. It works great for sterling silver chains, though!
I needed help from a handyman to install it under the kitchen sink, but after using the tablet, I noticed my sink drained faster with fewer issues. Not as convenient as powder, but it worked.
It’s a bit stiff.
One of the best protein flavors I've had! While others are still better, this one is still pretty good!
This is a solid product for back pain relief! After a car accident, I’ve tried many products, and this ranks in the top three for pain relief. It’s easy to use, and both my wife and I are satisfied with it.
This case is both attractive and sturdy. It holds 27 of my Vitamin E capsules. I love the design, and the clasp is very secure. My only issue is that the insert isn’t removable.
I’ve been dealing with heel pain from plantar fasciitis for a couple of months, and these have really helped reduce the pain. I wish they were a bit thicker for added support.
These are well-packaged, and I like them!
Not as good as some of the other products I’ve tried.
The product claims "No fish burps," but I experienced them 30 minutes after taking it. I won’t buy these again.
I gave this as a gift, and it exceeded my expectations. It’s convenient for both home and travel use. It’s compact, stylish, and easy to clean. After months of use, it’s still in great condition.
It scratched me badly.
The first container had black particles, almost like it had been opened before.
These bars are amazing! Low in sugar, high in protein, and packed with probiotics. They fill me up, and my kids love the flavor.
Great product. It shipped quickly, thank you!
This is just a flat iron with teeth, and it pulls and burns the hair. I wouldn’t recommend it—it’s a waste of money.
Moved too much and didn’t provide much support.
I wasn’t sure what to expect from this hemp product, but it worked surprisingly well on my inflamed leg muscle. It eased the pain in about five minutes, though it didn’t completely eliminate it. Results for headaches and sleep issues were mixed.
I love this product! It’s great for many ailments, but it does have an acquired taste. It's not cheap, but I think every household should have it.
These bags are strong and clear. I’m using them to move and store items. They're easy to open, and I’ve already bought more.
Not sure yet, since I just put them on.
I have M.S. and am recovering from multiple back fractures. These have helped me get through the day when I have to be in the car, in bed, after therapy, or sitting in the sun for Vitamin D.
Delivered as expected. Very practical for maintaining a clean countertop. It's convenient to have everything that is dishwasher-safe included.
Turmeric is incredibly beneficial for overall health, and these capsules also include ginger, which is another great addition.
I read several positive reviews, but I encountered an issue that wasn't mentioned. When trying to attach the top gasket (the one with the hole), it kept popping out of the blue ring. I was looking forward to using it after nearly a week without a shower. The fix was simple: I ensured the boot gasket was seated properly on the lower ring, then used surgical cloth tape to secure it. Once I centered the top gasket and pressed down the top ring, it stayed in place. Now everything works perfectly, and I’m ready for my shower.
This is fantastic! It works incredibly well on baby, kid, and adult stains, including formula, spit-up, baby food, and leaky diapers. By far the best stain remover I’ve tried!
This product gives an intense energy boost. It's amazing!
Leave this oil in your shower. While the water is still running, apply the oil to your body and rub it in. You can also pour some under the running bath water. This is my absolute favorite oil!
Tastes great and is of high quality. I highly recommend it.
I've been taking these daily for a month, and I’m happy with the results. Good quality Vitamin D3 at a reasonable price.
Needs reheating and is a bit chewy, but still tasty and useful for emergencies.
The order arrived with one broken candle, so I returned the whole set. I'm not sure about its longevity. It doesn't smell great when unlit, but it may improve once lit.
Used it for cleaning, and it smells wonderful, lasts a long time, and cleans effectively.
These are excellent and well-made. The sisal material is slightly scratchy, but it works well for cleaning, similar to a loofah. The bags hold up well in the washer; I throw them in with my towels.
It works, but the lock for the mouthpiece jet doesn't snap into place properly.
Very satisfied with this product. It met my expectations and needs.
It's an ineffective cleaner; I don’t feel like the mat is truly clean after using it, though it does smell nice.
These are nicely padded. If you have slim arms like I do, they may feel loose and slip down, but I prefer that to a tight fit that restricts circulation. I washed them once, air-dried them, and they’re still in great condition. I’m happy with the purchase and would buy again.
The unit works well overall, but the instructions are printed in an extremely tiny font and poorly written, likely due to a language barrier. They were not suitable for this unit, and the person who wrote them clearly wasn’t qualified.
I was pleasantly surprised by my first smoothie made with these smoothie blender bombs! It was delicious and kept me full for most of the day. I will definitely buy again. I tried the peanut butter chocolate flavor—so yummy!
I needed this for my 32 oz bottle of Hibiclens!
I’ve used KT tape and Rock tape, both excellent but expensive. I tried this brand, but it didn’t work for me—I’m allergic to the adhesive, which caused my ankle to itch, swell, and develop welts. Not happy.
This product did not work at all. It was a waste of money. I left it on a heel that was bothering me, hoping it would stretch out, but it did nothing.
Exactly what we needed!
This goat milk bath soak was luxurious. I bought the two-piece sampler and used the lavender & rose scent. It wasn’t overpowering, so it wouldn't clash with perfume. In winter, my skin gets dry, but this soak left my skin soft and moisturized, so I didn’t need lotion. It dissolves completely, and the bath water turns milky, offering a full spa experience. I love Five Sisters products and look forward to trying any new items they release!
The price is a bit high.
I appreciate that this Noni fruit powder is certified organic and non-GMO. It’s made from only Noni fruit, and the taste is subtle, so I usually add it to green drinks or fruit smoothies. It blends easily. The product includes a small 2g serving scoop (about a teaspoon), and with 114 scoops in the 8-ounce package, it’ll last a while. Seems like a good-quality product.
I suffered from chronic constipation for eight years, going from doctor to doctor, diagnosed with "Lazy Bowel Disease." After trying this product, I haven’t had constipation since. It took about a week of gradually increasing the dosage to feel the full effect, but to me, it’s been like a medical miracle. I’m very grateful.
I’ve sprayed my patio every day, but the stray cat still comes and waits for birds at my feeder. It’s a waste of money.
This collagen container is a bit expensive at $39.98, but compared to other high-quality collagens I’ve tried that were cheaper and also flavorless, this one is worth it. It dissolves well and has no taste. After taking collagen daily for about eight months, I’ve noticed my skin is more flexible and plumper. Consistency is key, and I’ve started to see results.
It feels flimsy, and I worry about stepping on it.
This is my favorite wild rice mix. One time, I couldn’t find it, so I tried the ‘Rice Select Rice Blend’—big mistake! The first ingredient was Texmati WHITE rice.
I’m not sure if it’s helped my joints or anything else, but it does a great job at maintaining my cholesterol, better than the fish pills.
These are very soft and easy to insert. They’re much better than others I’ve used, and at this price, just buy them!
I’m a big fan of Rez Block. It traps resin in the water, preventing it from accumulating in the glassware or ending up in our lungs. You’ll want to change the water more frequently because Rez Block shows how much residue it’s trapping.
The girl loves bath bombs, and now her mom gets to share them too. They both love this set. It’s great to give a gift that someone truly enjoys.
This is exactly what I need for extra protection against harsh chemicals in my work environment. It applies smoothly and isn’t greasy or heavy. This jar will last me quite a while.
Loved these decorations! I searched everywhere for modern birthday decorations and found several items from Ling's. Everything arrived in great condition and quality. I would definitely buy from them again.
I’m a huge protein powder fan. I start each day with a protein shake and love trying new flavors. Of the ones I’ve tried recently, this one and the oatmeal cookie flavor from the same brand are my favorites! The flavor is rich with a nutty chocolate taste, which I really enjoyed. It mixes smoothly and isn’t gritty at all. My only complaint is that it’s sweetened with sucralose. I’d prefer something more natural, like stevia or monk fruit, but otherwise, it’s fantastic!
Bounty works just as well for a fraction of the price.
This product has been a game changer for my post-surgery mobility. It’s lightweight and can easily be moved aside for another driver to use the car normally. I didn't buy it here but rented it directly from the seller, which is an excellent short-term option.
The flavor is outstanding, and it performs as expected. Highly recommend.
It’s too hot, and being tied to the USB is a major inconvenience.
Great for applying lotion or cream, but the roller could be more comfortable and easier to use.
This thermometer is not reliable. It read 34.6 today, which seems very inaccurate.
This chicory coffee, recommended by Anthony Williams, is a hit! I ordered it three times already, and my mom loves it too.
These mop heads are well-crafted with dense microfiber for excellent dust and pet hair pickup. The fringe helps clean up to baseboards without damaging furniture. They’re effective for dry mopping but less so for wet mopping due to the fringe. A high-quality product overall.
Perfect fit for my Water Furnace Series 7. The MERV 11 filter is ideal for my area.
This ice roller has a great weight, making it easy to use and effective. It stays cold long enough to work its magic, and the included case is a big plus. It’s also great for massaging the back. Highly recommend.
Excellent product with noticeable benefits.
I'm hoping these hair gummies will help improve my hair, skin, and nails. They taste great, are easy to chew, and contain essential vitamins. They seem affordable and are a good option for anyone looking to improve their hair health.
The coconut oil remains a liquid at room temperature, making it easy to use. While it's not the best moisturizer, it’s effective and odorless. I use it daily after showering.
This product ruined a pair of pants and caused pilling on a sweater.
My husband, who suffers from diabetic nerve pain, has seen improvements since taking this natural supplement. It’s helping him sleep better, and we hope continued use will completely relieve his foot pain.
My daughter loved this bath bomb! It fizzed beautifully and had a lovely, light fragrance. I’ll definitely buy this again and try other products from Da Bomb.
Initially, I loved this lip balm, but after two months of use, I had an allergic reaction. It caused irritation and dryness, and I’ve had to dispose of all the used items.
These products are durable and hold up well over time.
This shower seat has been perfect for my elderly father. It’s adjustable and fits his tub well, with a soap holder and mesh bag for added convenience. It’s a must-have for anyone with mobility issues.
These glasses are good overall, but the nose pads are too thin and uncomfortable. The arms don’t support the weight of the glasses, and they often bend, making them difficult to wear.
I noticed a significant improvement in my skin after using this product. Very pleased with the results.
HoMedics has really helped with my foot issues. Thank you!
Whether you believe in its healing properties or not, this black Tourmaline Pyramid is an attractive and calming decoration. It has a solid build and looks great on any table.
A true back-saver! Highly recommended.
I purchased this to remove old boat decals, but it was ineffective. Save your money and try acetone or Goo Gone instead.
These are amazing! I discovered them while traveling in Ireland and now can’t use anything else.
Unfortunately, this product arrived dead on arrival. Very disappointing.
This product is well-made and has been helpful for managing my pain.
I really like this product. It works great for my needs.
These earplugs work well, but the cord causes some vibration noise when moving. They are perfect for outdoor use, but I remove the cord when studying to avoid distractions.
I use this a few times a week on my Bichon to keep her eyes clean and bright.
I regret purchasing this. It didn’t work as expected and wasn’t functional for my needs.
These plugs are not made from pure silicone. I had an allergic reaction and had to remove them quickly. If you have sensitivities, avoid these.
I’m starting to feel some improvement in my knees, but it may take more time to see full effects. The rating may change as I continue using it.
These are easy to swallow, and together with our probiotics, they help maintain regularity and overall energy. Great natural solution, but individual tolerances may vary.
I haven’t used it yet, but it’s new and seems promising. The scent is nice, and it should work as intended.
These reading glasses are comfortable, clear, and stylish. The metal sides are surprisingly durable.
This product provides excellent support for my lower back, both in my car and at home.
After using this product off and on for a few months, I’m pleased with the results. It helps block fat and carbs, promoting regularity and encouraging healthier eating habits.
Perfect for relaxing after a day of indulgence. Highly effective.
Larry uses this every night to prevent foot burning and finally get a full night’s sleep. Great product!
As a busy mom, I appreciate this foot massager. It has variable speeds, pressure, and heat, but I wish I could turn off the heel massage when it gets uncomfortable. Otherwise, it’s a great product for relaxation.
This colloidal silver generator is incredibly easy to use and produces high-quality silver. I highly recommend it.
Provides great back support, both upper and lower, and is made from durable, comfortable materials.
These band-aids are not effective for healing bites but are good at preventing itching. They stay in place even after several showers, but I’m not sure I’d buy them again.
These wipes are strong and durable, offering great cleaning without shedding fibers. Perfect for use in electronics labs or other sensitive areas.
This item was a gift for my brother, but it broke after just three months of use.
Contrary to some reviews, the oil arrived well-packaged, and it’s been fantastic to use. Highly recommended.
These bags are fantastic! Beautiful and well-made, they’re perfect for storing snacks or treats. I’m obsessed with them!
This product performs as expected, fulfilling its intended function perfectly.
It's simple to use and effectively removes all the dirty liquid from the pad, ensuring you're not mopping with a soiled one.
I bought this repellent for my infant because it’s free of DEET (which I find unpleasant!). I really dislike seeing mosquito bites on her, especially on her face! I needed something gentle and minimally scented for her skin. This product seems to work well and hasn't caused irritation, even when applied to her face. We recently visited a new area and were immediately swarmed by mosquitoes. I applied the repellent to my baby, and it was impressive to see mosquitoes flying around her without landing on her skin. The scent is pleasant, and it appears effective. Highly recommend!
I purchased the Fitbit Aria scale to sync with my Fitbit Charge and MyFitnessPal to streamline my health journey. It definitely adds value when compared to my previous non-wifi digital scale. The sleek white design is aesthetically pleasing and not an eyesore in the bathroom. It’s responsive and appears accurate with both weight and body fat measurements. I love the auto-sync feature with my Fitbit and MyFitnessPal apps, eliminating the need for manual data entry. The scale can also recognize up to 8 people, which is convenient. While the price may feel steep, it’s a great fitness tool, especially if you already use a Fitbit Charge.
These deodorant tubes are smaller than usual, and the lids feel slightly loose, but they work effectively.
The colors are soft, the paper absorbs well, and the overall quality is great. I'm really happy with this product, and I believe you will be too.
Someone recently sprayed our office with Glade ICY Evergreen Forest, and it instantly created a Christmas-like atmosphere. I was pleased to find this spray on Amazon and also purchased the matching plug-in scent warmers.
The anti-fog performance is limited, and my glasses are constantly smudged. I have to clean them multiple times a day to try and eliminate the residue.
My dogs, including my shiba inu and pitbull-sharpei mix, love this toy, and it holds up to their chewing. It’s great that all three of my dogs can enjoy it. The bristles don’t seem to be cleaning much, but any chewing is better than none. Highly recommend for chewers of all sizes!
I’ve been using this product for years! I keep it in the shower and spray it all over after showering, especially on my elbows, knees, and feet before toweling off. I also spray a bit on my body when dry for a soft, non-shiny look. This is a fantastic product, and I highly recommend it!
There was some confusion regarding the pack count, as the description mentioned four but I received three pairs of reading glasses in blue, red, and brown. The wayfarer style with half-transparent stems is a nice touch. Each pair includes a matching foam case for easy identification. The lenses are thin but durable so far. It’s great to have three pairs in case one gets lost.
I use this every night. I had been taking multiple sleeping pills with no success, but now with this product, I feel well-rested. Even on restless nights, I drift in and out of sleep, and the night passes quickly without me noticing.
This file is fantastic but is hard to find in stores.
My child didn’t like the flavor.
My hair needs to grow a bit longer for this tool to work effectively. It doesn’t hold my hair well at its current length.
The product was too small due to improper measurements, but we’re still using it.
I take this product at night to help relax and sleep better. It’s also been great for relieving leg cramps. I love it!
The cleaners worked great, but I only liked the lemon scent. The lavender scent from the purple bottle was unpleasant.
Tastes great and provides a nice boost of energy!
This product simply works as expected.
These insoles are thick, comfortable, and fit well in my shoes. They’re well-made.
It works but doesn’t provide a close shave, which was disappointing.
Initially, I gave these earplugs one star as they didn’t stay in place. Later, I tried a new technique of dividing them in half, which worked much better. The exposed wax core helps hold them in place, and they wick moisture from my ears. These earplugs are now my go-to, and I’ll reorder when needed.
Love these! The colors are bright, exactly as I wanted.
Bought this for my husband, but it wasn’t very palatable, so we ended up throwing it away. If it doesn’t taste good, it won’t be used, no matter how beneficial it might be.
I practice hot yoga and needed a mat cleaner that’s gentle on my skin and not overpowering in scent. This product does just that with a mild fragrance and cleans well for regular surface cleaning. The towel is washable and a decent size.
The glasses stay on for a short while but eventually become greasy and slip off more than usual.
My son used to hate taking citrus-flavored probiotics, but these are individually packaged, so I can just sneak them into his bottle. It’s super easy and he’s been getting all the probiotics and prebiotics he needs. I recommend these, especially with cold season approaching!
A legitimate product, although the price is on the higher side.
The white mask is nice, but it's too large.
Great product with easy application. I’ll be referring clients to you.
This product is fantastic! 🙌
I needed a "soupy" toothpaste for my ultrasonic toothbrush, and this is essentially mouthwash—liquid form. I like the dispenser but would recommend saving your money for a more practical solution.
Exactly as expected! Each letter has two small hole punches for extra sturdiness and comes with string to create the banner. The glitter cardstock is of good quality, and all letters were included. A great value for the price, and it was shipped well to prevent bending.
Not sure if it’s related to this product, but I didn’t get sick during my trip abroad, including 12-hour plane rides.
CLA is a secret I’ve used for years to help manage my weight and maintain muscle. This formula is potent. The serving size is four capsules, and I split them between my two largest meals. I highly recommend this product.
These restrict airflow, causing me to wake up with a headache from not being able to breathe.
I’m satisfied with the product and the delivery time. However, I was concerned when the protective seal came off easily when I first opened it. It was sealed, but the glue used might have been weak. Otherwise, the item matched the description, and the price was fair.
I initially placed two units in different rooms, and I noticed the mold and mildew disappeared. To improve the overall scent in my home, I added more units. Now my house smells fresh and clean, and I haven’t had to replace the bulbs for over a year. I’m extremely happy with this product!
I was excited to try this vegan and organic product, but no matter what I added, it made my smoothies taste rancid. I’m not sure if I got a bad batch, but it’s not for me. I’ve found other plant-based protein powders that taste much better or at least don’t affect the taste.
If you’re looking for a good facial cleansing brush but don’t want to spend $200, this is a great alternative. It’s compact, easy to hold, and travel-friendly. It’s cordless and rechargeable, making it a solid skincare tool. Be sure to clean it regularly with antibacterial soap.
These clippers are sturdy and sharp but a bit tight to use, which can be challenging for those with weaker hand strength.
The product is well-made, great value, and shipping was quick!
I’m so glad I found these! Apple cider vinegar is great for you, but I prefer the gummies for easy consumption. They’re an excellent detox option.
It’s too soon to say if it’s whitening, but it’s great at eliminating morning breath and is perfect for use after meals, especially at the office during lunchtime.
It’s much smaller than expected and not very soft.
I bought this because it’s KLEENEX, so I knew it would be soft and absorbent. It’s fragrance-free and extra absorbent thanks to the two-ply design.
It works as advertised. I recommend this product.
Super cute! These made great party favors for my daughter’s birthday.
These are not extra wide or diabetic socks. They’re regular socks, and Amazon should be more diligent in checking product descriptions.
Excellent, sturdy product. I’ve only used it for a couple of days, but I prefer the clips over the loop attachments I’ve used before. I’ll be ordering more in different styles.
I didn’t like this brand. It turns on with the slightest touch, the cord is short, and the speed doesn’t meet my expectations. I won’t be purchasing it again or recommending it.
It was easy to attach, smaller than I expected, but still a good size and very sturdy.
This sound machine offers 24 sounds and includes an AC adapter, unit, cheat sheet, and instruction pamphlet. It’s easy to operate, and the nightlight feature is a nice touch. The sound options are decent, though the unit isn’t as sleek as others I’ve tried. It works well, but it’s not my top choice.
My kids adore Mario, and these
These patches may not be worth your time if you’re looking for a guaranteed solution. While they appear to match, the overall result might not meet expectations.
Highly effective pain relief patches that can be trimmed to your preferred size. They adhere securely and provide reliable comfort.
Used this on an off-white bench cushion at home, and it’s been fantastic. The instructions are straightforward, and it’s easy to clean dirt off the cushion. Plus, it’s odorless and non-toxic.
Amazing quality and vibrant colors! It exceeded my expectations for the price. Perfect for nails, and it prevents splitting better than emery boards.
After using 3 tablespoons every other day for two months, I noticed mixed results. While it’s authentic and effective, I experienced weight gain and hormonal fluctuations. I’ll continue using it and hope for stabilization.
Everything comes neatly packaged, and the directions are easy to follow. The soup was delicious, and I’m optimistic it’ll help with my lingering cold.
Unfortunately, these didn’t help curb my appetite. No noticeable changes while using them.
Adds a charming touch and looks adorable!
A+ for performance, but programming it can be a bit challenging.
Excellent Keto-friendly product! Great taste and adds a balanced touch to your meals.
While the saline solution is fine, the vials are expensive and poorly designed. They waste product and aren’t practical for consistent use.
Initially worked well for a smooth shave, but subsequent uses caused razor burn and ineffective results. Replacement options are inconvenient. Ultimately, I had to return it.
This spray is excellent for stain prevention on fabrics. Apply multiple layers for the best results. Highly recommended for anyone concerned about stains.
These sturdy lamps with clean designs are ideal for focused lighting. Great for reading, crafting, and even painting. The high contrast significantly reduces eye strain.
My wife found it bulky and inconvenient to carry.
Bought the wrong model by mistake. Not worth returning.
Works perfectly for personal use.
Ideal size for a dessert bar! Sturdy and stylish without being tacky.
The cuticle trimmer lacks sharpness and precision.
I gifted this product, and the recipient loved it!
Fantastic product and excellent seller!
This grabber has a great design, but my latest one broke within two days. Will request a replacement and update later.
These did nothing for me and even made me hungrier.
Ordered these twice, and they’re consistently fresh and high-quality.
Very comfortable and effective cushioning. Works exactly as intended.
Good price and very likable!
These can be tricky to keep in place. Despite cleaning thoroughly, they only stay adhered for a few minutes before lifting.
Terrible quality and single-use only. Frustrating to assemble and not worth the hassle.
Effective and seemingly beneficial for gum health too.
These earplugs are too large for small ear canals but are still better than foam plugs. Comfortable, washable, and cleaner.
Adding this mushroom supplement to my routine has improved my focus noticeably at work.
A great alternative to sugary drinks like Gatorade. Dissolves easily in water and could taste better when mixed with juice.
Easy to assemble and perfect for gifting. Versatile enough for party favors or special events.
Convenient but not very durable. Warping issues in the dishwasher make them less reusable than glass alternatives.
My cat lost interest quickly because the toy shuts off almost immediately when still. Extending the cut-off time could help keep their attention longer.
This LiPo bag provides an added layer of safety for storage and charging. However, it’s not a substitute for proper LiPo monitoring practices.
While roomy and functional, my clinical instructor advised against its use due to hygiene concerns. It’s now reserved for non-clinical settings.
A longer cord would be helpful, but it heats well and effectively relieves neck and back pain.
Arrived in great condition and enhances the user experience. Compact, comfortable, and worth it!
Perfect for sandals, these inserts provide much-needed support.
Cordless and convenient for home grooming. Long-lasting battery life makes it a great tool overall.
These gelatin-based snacks are perfect for babies learning to eat independently. Their size and texture make them easy to enjoy.
This product is outstanding! The flavor is amazing, and it works quickly after chewing. The taste is smooth and not chalky at all.
I got this to make bubbles for my 2-year-old, and it worked wonderfully! The bubbles were stronger than any store-bought ones, which often feel watered down.
Super easy to use and looks amazing. The scale works perfectly. My only minor issue is that fingerprints are noticeable but easy to clean with a cloth.
This is the only dishwasher powder I trust. I've tried others, but none clean as effectively.
I absolutely love this product! It functions flawlessly.
Simple to assemble and operate. Provides effective infrared sessions exactly where needed. Shipping was quick, and the price is great. I’d definitely buy it again.
Gorgeous stone! Unfortunately, it didn’t work for me. I think I’ll stick to buying these in person where I’ve had better luck.
High-quality product at a great price.
Purchased this because of its promising ingredients like 5 ATP and Royal Jelly. While initially, I didn’t notice much, taking the full dose caused severe side effects, including a headache and muscle pain. Though I recovered after proper hydration and rest, the risks outweighed the benefits for me. Proceed with caution.
This product is fantastic—packed with protein and fiber and tastes great! Even my daughter loves it. I mix it with bananas, blueberries, and other fruits for a filling meal.
The screws and parts arrived in great condition. I keep one in my car, bag, and nightstand. Affordable and reliable.
This bucket was perfect for soaking my feet while relaxing on the couch. It fits my size 9.5 men’s feet well. The handle feels sturdy, even when filled with water. The bottom has massage-like bumps for added comfort. While pricey for a plastic bucket, it’s worth it for its quality and purpose.
Beautiful pendulum, and it closely matched the picture.
Excellent microfiber cloth! It cleans eyeglass lenses streak-free every time.
Unfortunately, this one didn’t work for me. The plastic is too stiff and doesn’t stay closed around my hair. I doubt it would work for anyone.
Good price and does exactly what it’s meant to do. Not much else to say!
Impressed by the variety of herbs included. The package arrived quickly, and I’m a happy buyer.
Sadly, this product didn’t have any noticeable effect on me.
Kudos to the seller, Magickal Night, for fast shipping and secure packaging. The product itself is a standard spiritual supply item with a nice scent, though it fades quickly when used. Not bad for what it is.
The item has too much of a bend, making it uncomfortable to use.
Tried these brackets to create breathing space under a mask and prevent makeup smudges. Unfortunately, they were bulky, visible under the mask, and didn’t fit well for me. Not recommended.
Bought this for scalp itch relief, and it works great! The brush is easy to use and effective, especially with a clarifying shampoo. Even my skeptical husband started using it and enjoys it, so I had to get a second one!
The description claimed it was easy to use, but I found it required sewing or tape to stay in place. Despite this, I managed to wear it without issues.
Instantly relieves all my aches and pains—highly recommend!
Out of all I’ve tried, this one tastes great and dissolves easily. I’ve already reordered.
Love that it doesn’t upset my digestive system!
This cleaner is a game-changer for carpets! It leaves them spotless with a fresh scent and requires fewer passes with the steam cleaner.
Getting ten boxes at once is great value, and you can’t go wrong with Puffs!
The packaging was secure, and the value of this 10-pack is excellent.
Leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft! Worth every penny and the best price I’ve found.
Bought for my teen daughter, and it’s perfect for her curly, wavy hair. She loves the adjustable heat settings and finds it works beautifully. A great buy!
This glue is unbeatable. It lasts long and is waterproof—ideal for active people like me.
My daughter loves this selfie stick tripod for her videos. It’s portable, connects easily via Bluetooth, and has a convenient remote holder. While the tripod isn’t the sturdiest, it works well for her needs.
Great flavor, but be prepared to stay near the bathroom after consuming.
Unfortunately, these treats are not individually wrapped, making them inconvenient for administering medication to my dog. When purchased from the vet, they come pre-wrapped.
This slim, lightweight umbrella easily fits in a coat pocket or handbag. It’s a standard umbrella and not particularly sturdy. In NYC's wind tunnels, only the toughest umbrellas survive, so I still need to test this one. Likely similar to a drugstore umbrella.
Fits snugly on an average-sized female head and feels comfortable. I store it in the freezer for migraine relief. It eased my pain during a severe 18-hour migraine when no medication was an option. A helpful addition to my migraine toolkit.
These bags outperform the pricier ones I used before. They're easy to use, lightweight, and come at a much better value. Very pleased with this purchase!
Excited for the practicality of this product, but it’s heavy and pricey, limiting its use for carrying medications. However, the owner’s commitment to customer satisfaction was impressive, and a titanium replacement is on its way.
These are great for protecting placards from heat damage and bending. Clear, durable, and easy to use in the car.
Perfect for keeping tanning eyewear handy. Attached it to my keychain, and now I never forget them at my club.
These black shower poufs are soft and large, holding soap well and lathering effectively. While they’re almost too big to grip, I love the color and overall performance.
A great alternative to the discontinued Trunatal ginger capsules. These work just as well for morning sickness and nausea relief. Highly recommend giving them a try!
This scooter has been a game-changer for managing stress fractures in my feet. It’s convenient to own one instead of renting when needed.
This toner delivers a fine mist that cleanses and refreshes my face. Infused with calming ingredients like witch hazel, chamomile, and ginseng, it leaves my skin feeling clean and rejuvenated.
Quiet and efficient. The $30 coupon made it a great deal. Don't forget to register the 2-year warranty within 30 days.
Not sure if this product works or not yet, so I can’t rate it accurately.
Great for shaving with no sticky residue. Large bottle and excellent value. The scent is wonderful.
Disappointed. The diffuser stopped working after two weeks. It shuts off after a couple of minutes despite trying various outlets and settings.
Love the color and lack of smell. However, it chips easily and doesn’t adhere well to nails. Might need a good base coat for better results.
This dense foam neck stretcher offers great relief after desk work. Use it for 10-15 minutes a day to ease neck tension and regain curvature. Recommended!
I started using this oil after my acupuncturist recommended it. It’s a fantastic product.
Disliked the taste and size of this flavored water enhancer. Requires too many drops for large bottles and isn’t portable. Stick with Nuun tablets instead.
Handy size and effective at picking up dust. Comes with an extra refill. A great buy!
Excellent for sealing granite. Two coats covered well with plenty left. Highly recommend!
These plastic frame grips are comfortable and work perfectly. They keep my glasses in place while working. A great solution!
Pleasantly surprised by these replacement brushes—they work just like Clarisonic originals and are reasonably priced. Highly recommend!
Convenient replacement brushes at a great price. Ordering through Amazon was quick and easy.
Excellent price for bulk alcohol pads. Same quality as smaller packs. Delivery was very fast.
Initially rated 3 stars but downgraded to 1. These baking sheets caused my pastries to stick badly. Disappointed in the quality compared to a previous brand.
Simple and comforting product. It does the job.
Misleading advertisement. Received only four items instead of the advertised five-pack. Comfortable but disappointed in the count.
A versatile callus remover, effective both dry and wet. Gentle yet efficient, it keeps heels smooth.
Helpful supplement when paired with others.
This foot care device truly delivers! It’s safe, efficient, and finally gave me smooth heels. Worth every penny. Highly recommend!
These small bottles make it easy to keep my glasses clean on the go. Highly effective cleaner.
Convenient travel packs for toothpaste, mouthwash, and breath spray. Compact and practical. Wish for more toothpaste and mouthwash, though.
Disappointed with the new floss quality. It’s thinner, shreds easily, and doesn’t grip well. Not recommended.
Perfect fit and great feel. Highly satisfied!
Affordable contact solution that works well without causing any irritation. Very pleased.
Durable and long-lasting product. No issues so far.
This bracelet is perfect for small wrists, and it hasn’t tarnished despite daily wear—even in water.
Powerful and effective callus remover. Relieves pain and improves comfort. Highly recommend!
Eliminates odors effectively, even in large open areas. Ensure placement near the source for the best results.
Comfortable and effective masks with adjustable ear loops. Passed the candle test. The Galaxy-D design is beautiful and fits well. Highly recommend!
The product perfectly matches its description.
It's challenging to find these in stores, but they are exactly what I needed—thicker, longer, and superior quality.
More affordable than buying from the tool truck, and the fit is just as excellent.
This hot water bottle features thicker walls than most, which is a great advantage. One side has a texture to prevent overheating, and the included sweater enhances comfort. For moist heat, simply place a damp washcloth between the bottle and its sweater. Just remember to empty it after use and avoid microwaving it.
I cannot express my gratitude enough—this product literally saved my dog's life. Absolutely incredible!
It works seamlessly with the Philips electric toothbrush.
These were highly effective at preventing safety glasses from fogging up while wearing masks. They lasted a long time and performed excellently.
Fantastic reusable straws as described. They make me feel good about reducing plastic waste, especially after seeing heartbreaking videos about ocean pollution. Plus, they look stylish!
Thanks to my sister's recommendation, I finally found a protein shake I genuinely enjoy. I mix it with milk, and it’s delicious—a definite five-star product!
UPDATE: The item didn't last two months, so I’ve adjusted my rating. However, the Waterpik meets all my expectations with three speed settings, benefiting my gums and effectively cleaning areas a toothbrush misses.
Purchased this for a second time—it works well for opening skin pores.
After trying various masks, I’ve struggled to find one that keeps my glasses from fogging and feels breathable. Unfortunately, none of the options have solved the issue, and I may also be a bit claustrophobic.
This stain remover is phenomenal! It handles tough stains on baby, kids, and adult clothing with ease. I’ll never use anything else again.
Detergent strips are a game-changer for me—compact, mess-free, and easy to use, especially when traveling. They clean my clothes effectively and are much more convenient than liquid detergents.
DripDrop hydration is excellent, and I’m glad I can order it online since it’s unavailable in my area. It works as promised.
I need a bandage that doesn’t adhere to wounds, and this one fits the bill.
These sponges don’t work. I scrubbed hard to no effect, leaving my skin red and irritated. Total waste of money.
The sponge size is good, but it feels a bit overpriced. Hopefully, it lasts as long as my previous one.
Easy to install with a stick-and-twist method. Even with arthritis, I could do it, and it made using the handheld attachment much easier.
Excellent earplugs at a great price. Perfect for shooting and loud machinery, with a handy cord to prevent losing them. Highly recommended for protecting your hearing.
These tips fit perfectly without any hassle, unlike others I’ve tried.
Disappointing product—it didn’t perform as expected. I’m returning it.
This sponge works better than I expected for cleaning my cat’s teeth. It’s durable, easy to use, and doesn’t break easily, even with sharp teeth.
These glasses are the perfect size for me, with distortion-free lenses and durable, stylish frames. Exactly what I needed.
Not suitable for sensitive skin, but it’s an excellent joint pain reliever.
Just like the ones I get at the store but at a fraction of the price. They’re also easy to cut to fit various shoe sizes.
The product seemed promising but ended up being painful and ineffective, even causing minor injuries. I won’t use it again.
Quiet and effective. It keeps my home smelling fresh, even with multiple pets.
This cane is stable, strong, and worth every penny.
One of the best natural sunscreens I’ve tried. It rubs in well, smells great, and offers excellent protection, even under the intense Florida sun.
Works exactly as advertised—I love it!
This bath bomb set was the perfect gift for my friend, who loves a relaxing soak. The quality is great, and she was thrilled to receive it.
While the concept is good, the product is inconvenient to use, and the shiatsu balls can be painful in certain positions. I ended up returning it.
Easy to use, smells wonderful, and all-natural. I adore Method products!
After two days of use, I like this chair overall, but the beeping buttons are annoying, and the turning radius requires some adjustment. However, it’s comfortable, quiet, and met my urgent need for a replacement.
These inserts are simple yet effective. They provide extra support and adhere easily to shoe soles. The clear ones are nearly invisible, which I love.
Save your money and buy Bounty paper towels instead.
The tray is nice but didn’t fit over my walker’s rubber grips. Manufacturers should design trays to accommodate grips.
I use this daily, and it’s been issue-free for over a month.
I’ve been using this for years—it always gets the job done.
Tangy Tangerine is a fantastic product with all the essential vitamins you need. Highly recommend!
I appreciate that this powder is certified USDA Organic, especially since it’s often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It’s versatile and easy to add to yogurt or smoothies.
These shoe insoles offer a significant improvement over the thin foam alternatives. They provide solid arch support and feature adhesive backing to keep them securely in place. The leather surface gives them a premium touch. However, there are a few downsides: 1) The insole length is limited to 23 to 34, which leaves your toes without adequate cushioning. 2) It was challenging to align the insole with my low boots, as the insoles are narrower than expected, requiring multiple attempts to find the best fit. Flats would have been easier to manage due to their more open footbed. 3) The cushioning is minimal, as the insole is relatively thin.
This probiotic blend stands out with its 15 different strains of beneficial bacteria, contributing to a healthier gut. The delayed-release feature ensures that the probiotics reach the lower intestines rather than being destroyed by stomach acids. With 30 billion CFUs per serving, the potency is impressive. Since using it, I've experienced no negative reactions and improved digestion, with regular bowel movements and no constipation. However, it's worth noting that it contains milk, so individuals with dairy allergies or intolerances should avoid it. Overall, Premiva Ultra Probiotic is an effective product that supports digestion and immunity. I received this as a complimentary item for review, but my evaluation is honest and unbiased to help others make informed purchasing decisions.
These wipes are far too abrasive for use on my baby's sensitive skin. They feel as though they could easily irritate or damage delicate skin.
The product adheres well and stays in place throughout use.
The scent is woodsy, similar to pencil shavings. After using it twice daily for a week, I've noticed significant improvement in my heel cracks. The thick yet non-gooey consistency, combined with a convenient applicator, makes it easy to use without staining clothes, and it washes off effortlessly.
I should have replaced the blades much sooner. They perform excellently, even handling long chest hairs. The only downside is the need to clean the shaver head frequently. Replacing the cutters is simple—just push them down one at a time and slide them out.
The DDgro back brace is well-built with three thin metal bars that provide comfortable support. It's helpful for alleviating back pain and improving posture. My husband uses it for gardening or when lifting heavy items. We both find the large size fits us well, as a medium would likely be too tight.
This mask is a game-changer! Unlike traditional sleep masks with Velcro straps, which tend to stretch out and become tangled in hair, this one uses adjustable ear loops. It also features a smooth, cool side and a warm side for versatility. My only suggestion would be to raise the material around the eyes slightly for added comfort. Despite this minor adjustment, the mask offers a superior sleeping experience.
While I love the idea of compostable bags, these didn't work well due to a weak thinning line that caused them to tear even with light contents. This specific batch of bags was disappointing.
The bags serve their purpose, but my elderly mother-in-law struggled to unzip them. Regular snack bags from the grocery store work just as well and are more affordable.
This pill organizer is a great concept, and the customer service is exceptional. Although the stickers on two of the boxes were misplaced, the company promptly provided a replacement set. A solid buy for anyone who takes multiple tablets.
I highly recommend this product for anyone with sore muscles. It’s incredibly effective and should be in everyone's toolkit for muscle relief.
The knee scooter offers excellent mobility, but the knee pad could use more padding. The faux leather covering wore down quickly. However, the scooter's quick-release handlebars are a major convenience compared to other models. Despite the issues, it’s a decent product for the price.
While the rasp works well with both coarse and fine grinds, the nail brush is unremarkable. It does the job but isn't particularly outstanding.
The pills are too large to swallow comfortably! I’d prefer two smaller pills rather than struggling to swallow one. I wish there were an easier alternative.
I bought this toothbrush because it features charcoal bristles and a bamboo handle. It feels different from traditional toothbrushes, but it works remarkably well, leaving my teeth feeling cleaner. I loved it so much I bought another set.
This stain remover is a must-have for diaper blowouts and spit-up stains. I sometimes need to soak heavily stained items for a longer period, but it always works wonders. Even with new solid food stains, it performs just as well.
This product is great for skincare, offering a good amount for the price. I can’t comment on the taste, but I would definitely repurchase.
It provides a soothing warmth, perfect for temporary relief.
This box is ideal for storing oils, as they fit perfectly inside.
This shaver gives me the closest shave I’ve ever had. It works great in the shower and is easy to clean. Although the instructions could be clearer, particularly with the small images, the shaver is a solid choice. To remove the middle head, just twist counter-clockwise and pull it out.
Very user-friendly, making it easy to operate.
This detergent works well with our European dishwasher, although it doesn’t perform quite as well as higher-end powders.
After dealing with dry eye from long, dusty workdays, I gave this contact solution a try. It doesn’t work miracles, but it does freshen up my lenses when they start feeling uncomfortable. I only use it when necessary, but it’s effective for a quick fix.
My husband was tired of using tennis balls on his walker, so we tried these socks. Unfortunately, they ripped almost immediately, and without the socks, they damaged our wood floors. We ended up discarding them.
This product didn’t work for me—it left my hair too puffy.
I use this product to support gut health, and it seems to work well for my needs.
These gummies are too hard and stick to the teeth, which makes them difficult to chew. While the flavor and fiber content are great, their hardness is a major downside.
