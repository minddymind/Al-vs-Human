This review aims to clarify another user's misunderstanding of the product's labeling. It correctly states 1000 mg as advertised, with an additional note of 12 mg, referring to magnesium on the periodic table. If you are dealing with constipation due to opiate-level medications, consult your doctor about alternatives like Linzess. However, for most people, magnesium works effectively when taken with food and plenty of water. Previously, I took one 1000 mg pill every morning and evening with meals and a full glass of water.
These bleach tablets are an excellent, convenient alternative to carrying bulky bleach containers. During the pandemic, I struggled to find them locally and was relieved to discover them available here.
After months of heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis, I tried these and was amazed at how much they reduced the discomfort. A tighter and thicker version could make them even better.
This product is affordable and fulfills its purpose. However, the "massage" feature is underwhelming, consisting of just three small plastic parts for foot scraping. It’s better than using a plain tub, but the feature could be improved.
This product did not work for me, but that doesn't mean it won’t work for others.
I rarely took vitamins before the pandemic, but I started a regimen of Vitamin C, D3, and Zinc to strengthen my immune system. This bottle includes 300 tablets, enough for three months, and I experienced no side effects taking them on an empty stomach. Highly recommended for anyone prioritizing their immune health.
My husband used this shaver for facial and nose hair instead of a balding head. The attachments are easy to switch, and the shave was close and comfortable. The nose trimmer worked well without irritation, making this a great value.
This sound machine is compact and perfect for travel, offering quality sleep by masking noise. While I noticed the looping at its 90-second interval before falling asleep, it didn’t disturb me once asleep. I’ll continue using it on trips.
These colorful holiday gift bags are ideal for gifting baked goods, wine, or small presents. The drawstring ribbon secures the bags nicely, making them great for teachers, neighbors, or family gifts.
These teeth-whitening strips are a budget-friendly alternative to more expensive brands. They don’t adhere as well and deliver only slight improvements in whiteness, but their affordability makes them worth considering.
