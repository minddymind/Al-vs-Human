1. These back massagers make incredible gifts—I’ve had mine for years and still love it! It’s easy to use, super portable, and lets you enjoy a back rub whenever you want. Highly recommend for anyone dealing with stress!  
2. Works great as a makeup remover and has a lovely fragrance.  
3. My old duty belt case wore out after years of use, and this replacement was perfect. It’s affordable, fits extra gloves and a mask, and works without any issues.  
4. This charger is fantastic! The built-in safety features are a big plus, and it’s helped me refresh older rechargeable batteries I thought were useless. It works seamlessly and looks great—definitely getting another one for my office. Highly recommended!  
5. Use caution with these pills. I took half of one and had a terrible reaction—stomach pain, diarrhea, and nausea all day. It might be due to my sensitivity to caffeine. Please be careful!  
6. The "rabbit" part didn’t work for me—it was too long, the vibrations were way too strong, and it only lasts an hour after a three-hour charge.  
7. It smells amazing, retains heat really well, and feels incredibly soft.  
8. This diabetic bag is my favorite! It’s compact but fits all my essentials—insulin pen, meter, alcohol wipes, needles, and even an ice pack if needed. Fits perfectly in my purse, too.  
9. I haven’t received this order yet, but I’ve used these batteries before. They don’t last as long as others, but the rechargeability makes them worth it.  
10. Super soft and affordable.  
11. I was excited to try these in my coffee and tea. The flavors were unique—not bad but not amazing. I didn’t notice any immediate benefits and found the price too high to keep experimenting. If you like earthy flavors, you might enjoy these more than I did.  
12. Everyone loves seeing this on my dad—it gets so many compliments!  
13. Very comfortable and great at relieving pressure on my hips and lower back.  
14. A great daily probiotic! Easy to swallow, vegetarian, and packed with good bacteria to support gut health and overall well-being.  
15. The product is great, but it arrived dented, with poor packaging. I kept it because I didn’t want to deal with returning it, but it was disappointing.  
16. I’ve finally found the perfect heating pad! It has six heat settings, and even the lower ones are warm enough. The size is fantastic, and I’ve already recommended it to friends.  
17. These wipes are thick, smell great, and don’t shed any fuzz. They’re a great price, and I’ll definitely buy more.  
18. This VG is thick, flavorful, and works perfectly for all my DIY projects.  
19. These pills smell strong, but surprisingly, I don’t taste them. After a week of use, they’re working well for detoxing and seem to be good quality. Worth a try!  
20. The screw holding the carbide tip was stripped, making it hard to remove.  
21. I put this under my sheets, and it completely changed how I sleep. If I forget to use it, the difference is huge. So glad I tried it!  
22. This product delivers on its promises—it really works!  
23. After weeks of daily use, I haven’t seen results for my under-eye bags, but I’ll keep giving it time.  
24. Gave me more energy and focus—perfect for workouts or computer work.  
25. Don’t waste your money. Mine arrived half-empty, and it’s not worth the price.  
26. Puff Facial tissues are a lifesaver for sore, runny noses! They’re super soft and even have lotion to help prevent that red, irritated nose that comes with colds. Each cube-shaped box holds 52 tissues, and with a 10-pack, you can stash them all over—on your desk, in the car, and throughout the house.  
27. This noise machine is a game changer! We loved it for our bedroom, so we got another for our baby’s room, and it’s amazing for drowning out outside sounds. The baby now associates it with sleep, which makes bedtime easier. However, after months of use, the sound does seem softer, and one machine developed an annoying rattle. Hoping a replacement will fix the issue, as it’s been a nightly staple for years.  
28. This stuff works wonders!  
29. Coppertone brings back such nostalgia for me—it’s the same classic smell I remember from childhood, but now with SPF 30! It goes on smoother than I recall and is water-resistant, perfect for pool days. Just follow the directions to reapply as needed, and it’ll keep you covered.  
30. Heads up—these don’t fit all eyelash curlers.  
31. My wife absolutely loves these tissues. They’re so soft!  
32. If you’ve dealt with constipation, you’ll recognize the ingredients in this product—psyllium husk for fiber and senna for relief.  
33. I might be in the minority, but I think this stuff tastes delicious!  
34. Just as described—I’m very pleased with this product.  
35. Tart cherry capsules sounded promising, as I’ve read they help with inflammation, muscle soreness, insomnia, and even gout. While I didn’t notice any major improvements in my symptoms after a couple of weeks, I didn’t experience side effects either. The pills are vegetarian and include a concentrated extract, which the brand claims is equivalent to 1000mg. It might work for others, but for me, it felt like taking a placebo.  
36. This didn’t stay secure on a walker and had to be returned.  
37. This neti pot two-pack is affordable and works great for sinus flushing. My husband likes reusing plastic ones, but I can’t stomach the idea. This set is a perfect middle ground—practical without breaking the bank.  
38. Slept like a baby with this product and woke up feeling great—no grogginess! The only issue? My roommate keeps stealing them.  
39. Charmin big rolls are the best! They last a long time and are perfect for household use.  
40. At first, this seemed to help with leg cramps, but over time, it stopped being effective.  
41. The quality of this product is disappointing—very cheap.  
42. This leaves your skin feeling baby-soft, but you’ll still need an extra cream for stubborn ingrown hairs. I’d recommend it to friends with that caveat.  
43. This makes moving around with a walker so much easier!  
44. I love this toothpaste! You only need a tiny bit, so it lasts forever, and it seems to be whitening my teeth. It’s also free of SLS, which is perfect for my allergies. I just wish it were a little less expensive.  
45. Lightweight, sturdy, and packed with useful information!  
46. This product works fine, but it feels a bit unsteady and could benefit from a counterweight for balance.  
47. My husband learned the hard way that rinsing stainless steel bottles isn’t enough. After seeing inside with a flashlight, we got this cleaning brush, and it’s been a lifesaver for bottles like my daughter’s Hydro Flask. I do wish the handle were longer and the brush head bigger, but it does the job!  
48. These require a lot of pressure to use properly and can hurt if you’re not careful. They’re not really easier than using your fingernails, but I’ll keep practicing. If your skin is delicate, approach with caution.  
49. This works just like the name-brand version but costs less—great value!  
50. These glasses are fantastic—stylish and well-made. Here are the reworded reviews, keeping the meaning intact:
51. This is the perfect case for my pulse oximeter. It helps me keep track of it much better now.
52. These are so cute and offer great value for the price. I have two daughters, so the 4-pack is ideal – we usually find two at bedtime. They’re adorable, and my girls absolutely love them!
53. A bit on the pricey side, but it does exactly what it promises.
54. This is an excellent product. I have very thin, sensitive skin, and using regular band-aids usually causes more harm than good. I was desperate when I found these, and they’ve been perfect for me. They’re truly made for sensitive skin, come off easily without causing damage, and stay on until you decide to remove them.
55. I’ve been using a water machine to purify and alkalize my water for years. My research showed that it removes many minerals along with chlorine and fluoride, which is why I bought this. Using the Purely-Min is a great way to replenish those minerals. I’ve been using products from North American Herb & Spice Co. for many years, and they’re among the best. It’s great to see this brand available on Amazon.
56. This supplement combines ingredients that help boost energy and increase alertness. Here’s what’s in it:- **Thiamine (B1)**: Essential for glucose metabolism and supports nerve, muscle, and heart function. - **Riboflavin (B2)**: Helps break down carbs, proteins, and fats for energy, and supports oxygen usage. - **Niacinamide (B3)**: Supports many cellular processes. - **B6 and B12**: Essential for nervous system function, improving mood, and boosting energy.- **Caffeine (from Guarana Seed Extract)**: Helps with weight loss and reduces mental and physical fatigue.- **L-Tyrosine**: Improves mood and performance.- **Eleuthero Root (Siberian Ginseng)**: Boosts energy and metabolism.In my experience, this supplement is very effective, but I wouldn’t take it within 10 hours of bedtime due to its high B-vitamin content. I wouldn’t recommend taking it regularly, but as an occasional supplement, it definitely works. ⭐️ I’ll update this review if I find anything new!
57. Very pleased with both the product and the seller. Would definitely buy again.
58. I developed a sore on my left elbow from leaning on it while working at my desk and while driving. Despite trying various creams, it wouldn’t heal. Then I bought this item (I got two – one for the desk and one for the car), and my elbow started to heal right away. The pad relieved the pressure, giving the ointments time to work. I like that it’s breathable, keeping my arm cool with the mesh design. The pad slips a bit but can easily be adjusted. I keep one on my desk and the other in the car’s door pocket. My dermatologist even thought it was a smart idea!
59. I absolutely love these! I can’t wait to finish my doily and block it. They’re way better than using a padded towel!
60. These vitamins were exactly what I expected. They melt quickly too.
61. Very convenient for soaking my night guard.
62. This product didn’t work at all. It ended up being a waste of money!
63. I couldn’t use it until after washing it several times due to a strong odor.
64. I use kinesiology tape for my bad knees, and I hoped this would offer support for my back as I work on reducing my belly. Unfortunately, it only works for one application, and it’s not reusable. The product claims it’s good for multiple days, but that’s misleading. You’d have to buy new ones regularly, and even then, it’s unlikely to last long. Save your money and get a reusable option instead!
65. Honestly, this is the worst thing I’ve ever tasted. It didn’t taste like vanilla or chai at all – it just tasted like dirt. I haven’t tried the other flavors, but for the price, it’s just not worth it.
66. Very nice, I love the moist heat. The only downside is that the beads need to be manipulated into position.
67. After searching for a while, I found these vegan gummy fiber vitamins for my 3-year-old. He loves them and looks forward to eating them every day! He even thinks they’re candy!
68. I read the reviews and decided to give this a try. I first tried the Pina Colada flavor – it smelled great, but the aftertaste was awful. I had to throw it away. Thankfully, the variety pack had two other flavors, but they all left a strange metallic aftertaste. Definitely would not recommend.
69. I wasn’t a fan of this product because it gave me the jitters!
70. I really love this product – it’s very refreshing!
71. These containers are a college student’s dream! They’re stackable, easy to clean, and perfect for meal prepping or storing leftovers. Just be cautious with tomato-based sauces—they might stain. A must-have for anyone looking to stay organized!
72. I was skeptical at first, but this product exceeded my expectations. After just a few days, my teeth were noticeably whiter, even with my stubborn stains. Highly recommend it for tough whitening cases!
73. These provide some compression support, but they lack side stability for my knee. They’re fine for light exercise but not great for preventing injuries. Also, I’m skeptical about the “copper infusion” claims—it feels more like a gimmick than science.
74. As soon as I opened the box, I realized these were cheaply made. I tried to use them for a week, but they didn’t hold up. All three went straight to the trash.
75. This works well enough for carrying my portable oxygen tank, though it’s not a perfect fit. It’s functional, but I’m still on the lookout for something better.
76. These wires work great with my machine! My old ones had a quirk where the wire didn’t plug in properly, but now everything works perfectly again. The shipping was fast, and the price for 2 sets was very reasonable, especially with free Prime shipping.
77. This product caused a lot of discomfort. It was rough on my skin and actually tore it while I was walking, causing bleeding. I had to remove it halfway through my walk, and it even stuck to my socks. Definitely wouldn’t recommend it if you have sensitive skin.
78. I really enjoy the egg white protein bars from Julians Bakery, and this cinnamon flavor is no exception if you’re a fan of cinnamon. My personal favorites are the Devils Food Chocolate and Glazed Donut flavors, but the Sunbutter one is also amazing!
79. This is a convenient storage option for batteries, but I wish the pieces were combined into fewer parts. Having so many small compartments feels a bit cumbersome.
80. Item arrived on time and was exactly as described by the seller. No issues at all.
81. My husband bought me these earplugs, and I’m so glad he did! I have small ears, so it’s hard to find earplugs that fit. These fit perfectly and I can wear them for hours without discomfort. I liked them so much I bought another set for my mom, who also loves them.
82. I used these to replace the yellowed nose pads on my old glasses, and they worked great! They’re very soft and easy to install with a tiny screwdriver. Replacing them took about 10 minutes for both pairs of glasses.
83. This boot wax worked wonders on my old hiking boots! They were scuffed and dried out, but after using this, they look almost new. It took just a little bit of effort with a rag to rub the conditioner in, and the boots looked amazing afterward.
84. After trying several silver lozenges, I can confidently say the Manuka Honey ones from American Biotech are the best. If you're watching your blood sugar, I wish they made these with agave syrup, but otherwise, they’re a great choice.
85. My product arrived on time, and I’m very happy with it. Everything was as expected.
86. I like Kuumba products, but it’s always a bit of a gamble. Some of the scents last a long time and smell great, while others barely have a scent at all. It’s frustrating, but the ones that work are fantastic.
87. These are nice and compact, which makes them super convenient. No complaints here!
88. This soap worked fine for cleaning my clothes during a trip to Europe. Just make sure you use it with dry hands as instructed—my sister’s hands were wet when she tried it and it turned into a lump, which wasn’t ideal.
89. I found this heated hair straightener brush to be okay. The section for hair is pretty small, which made it tough to straighten some parts of my hair. The design is nice, but I won’t be recommending it to anyone.
90. I’ve been taking this for a month and have seen no changes. It’s disappointing to spend money hoping for results and not get any.
91. I bought this flat iron because of the great reviews and I’m happy with it so far. It takes some getting used to, especially with the twisting motion needed to create curls, but I’ve managed. It’s nice quality and works well for the price, though I can’t speak to its longevity yet.
92. I liked the idea, but I just couldn’t figure it out and ended up throwing it away. 
93. I’ve been using this D3-K2 supplement for a while and it’s been great. After learning that I was low on Vitamin D, this has helped get me back into the ‘normal’ range. The combination with K2 seems to be a good design.
94. I love how easy these are to use! No fuss, just great functionality.
95. This is a very good product. I’m sure it helps with various health issues, and I highly recommend it. My only downside is the increased price from the seller, so I’ll be looking for alternatives, but I trust the brand.
96. This scarf is beautiful and lightweight, perfect for spring and summer. The quality is also impressive.
97. This belt has a super hot gel pack that doesn’t transfer the heat well through the thick synthetic pouch. I was hoping for a cotton pouch for better heat transfer. After a few uses, the gel pack started to show signs of wear, so it might not last long.
98. Great purchase! Very happy with it.
99. This cleaner got all the grease off my rental cabinets and made them feel like new! However, be careful—it can be abrasive on certain surfaces.
100. I’m buying another one because it was exactly what I needed! I can walk around the house without my knee brace now. Just be careful when washing it—I didn’t follow the washing instructions and ended up needing a replacement.
101. The scent is simply delightful—soft, silky, and powdery. As expected from Avon, the quality is top-notch.
102. I noticed a positive difference within just one day of using this product.
103. These towels are fantastic for specific cleaning tasks. They are thin but absorb water quickly and hold a good amount. You can rinse them, let them dry flat, and reuse them multiple times, making them a more sustainable option than paper towels. They're perfect for cleaning windows, glass, and smooth tiles. However, they aren't as effective for rough surfaces as they might tear. The only downside is the unnecessary graphics printed on them. Aside from that, they perform excellently, last a long time, and are more cost-effective than paper towels.
104. This device has very little power, and it didn’t last long before it gave out.
105. We grilled 12 lb burgers from the Treasure Truck, and they were absolutely amazing! Everyone loved them. We also got hot dogs and sausages, and I’ve heard good things about those too. Can't wait to try them!
106. You can definitely feel a difference in how the pump works when using this product versus not using it. Be mindful, though, it can be overstimulating if taken too late.
107. These worked great! Within a day, I noticed a change in my appetite. The best part? No caffeine jitters like with other products. My energy levels have also improved. Highly recommend!
108. We use cotton balls for all sorts of things around the house, from crafts to beauty supplies, so it's always good to have some on hand. These are a bit smaller but denser than regular cotton balls, and they're a bit pricier at $4.99.
109. It doesn’t seem to be collecting enough hair or fur as I expected.
110. This is a beautiful, functional dowsing board made of lightweight wood. It has eye-catching center illustrations and clear, readable responses. The back is plain, and it doesn't come with a carrying case or box, but it’s still a nice addition. It even includes a complimentary ankh pendant, a vintage-style postcard, and a cute thank you banner.
111. Requires little force to use, and the durable file on the handle is a nice touch!
112. While these don't seem to be real jade, they work exactly as expected. They’re soothing and comforting, help with lymphatic movement, and provide a temporary plumping effect similar to what you'd get from a facial or massage.
113. I usually rely on Ayer Gel Nadal Spray when flying to keep my nostrils moisturized and fight off airborne germs. This spray works well, though I had to reapply it multiple times. It's effective for everyday use, but for flights, I prefer the thicker gel spray. Still, I’ll continue using this at home and work for nasal moisture.
114. I added this to my smoothie, and it tastes great! Definitely recommend it to anyone looking to live a healthier lifestyle. Plus, shipping was super fast. Great seller!
115. I enjoy using this scale, even though it’s a bit off on the readings—still, it’s fun to use!
116. Works well—not too strong, but just enough.
117. Not sure yet, I just received it.
118. It's really great, but the sand timer takes a while to empty, about 3 minutes or more.
119. I’d never used a pumice stone before, so I might have picked the wrong one. The holes in this one are large, making it a bit harsh for my feet. However, the product arrived as described.
120. I love these sponges! I was worried about germs with traditional sponges, but these are amazing and so easy to disinfect. The built-in scraper is perfect for my stoneware cookware. I even gave one to my mom, and she's hooked too!
121. I don’t remember having nose plugs as a child, but if we did, they were probably made from dinosaur parts. The kids love them, so that’s all that matters.
122. I’m no longer working in a hospital, but I volunteer at a free clinic for both humans and animals.
123. These seem to be working well for my daughter, who has flat feet and gait issues. She’s even trying to run now, which she didn’t before. I’ll probably be buying more.
124. This is a lovely product—convenient, comfortable, and easy to use. I really love it.
125. Barley Max has a good taste, but the mint addition made it hard to drink. The sweet taste doesn’t work for me, so I’ll stick with the regular Barley Max without added ingredients. It’s great for adding greens to my diet though.
126. These are my fifth pair of Lollop compression socks. I ordered the medium-large size, but they’re too big in the foot area. The compression around my calves is great, and I feel comfortable wearing them all day without feeling squeezed. They wash well and look stylish, but the sizing needs to be adjusted for a perfect fit.
127. My daughter loves stylish sneakers but they lacked arch support. I ordered these inserts, which are customizable and help with arch support. She’s much happier with her shoes now, but she prefers more cushion in the heel area too.
128. These gloves are almost the same as standard dishwashing gloves, just a bit thinner and shorter. Regardless, they’re great for various tasks around the house, including working on the car.
129. The quality is excellent, and this brush works wonders on my car carpet. I bought a second one for my truck, and it keeps it looking great!
130. I’ve only been using this product once a day so far, so I’m not sure about the dosage. It says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract, but I’m not sure if that’s the actual amount or just the weight. It’s frustrating that the packaging doesn’t have clear dosing instructions. As for the results, I haven’t noticed a reduction in cravings yet, but I’ll give it more time. The powder mixes well in a shaker cup and seems to work well with smoothies or juices. The taste is mild, and I’m hopeful it’ll help with my health goals. I’ll update after using it longer.
131. Got this for my DIL and she loved it!!  
132. I have short, curly, thick hair, and this brush works perfectly to keep it under control. Love it!  
133. Very easy to use and shipped quickly! We’ve only had them for a few days, but they work perfectly.  
134. Haven’t used these yet, but they seem like good, heavy quality at a great price.  
135. How hard is it to make a scent that matches the label and doesn’t make your eyes water, nose burn, or coat your throat like tire fire vapors? I’ve been disappointed by all the Glade refills I’ve tried. Harsh, unpleasant, and only vaguely close to the label’s claims.  
136. Started having frequent nosebleeds, and I keep one in my car, purse, and by the bed! A hospital charged my dad $79 for one of these—this is a deal!  
137. This has really helped my success with THM. Knowing I can make a safe and yummy dessert saves my sanity.  
138. This is my third main warmer. I love it and it’s totally worth the money.  
139. Four colorful compression socks in this package. I wear a 9-10 shoe, so I chose the large-x-large size. The compression is light, though, and the toe box feels awkward. Not uncomfortable, but needs adjusting. Overall, they look and feel great. The colors are fun, but I took off two stars for the light compression and weird toe box.  
140. Bought this about 20 years ago (not from Amazon) and it’s still going strong! I have thin, wispy hair, and it keeps it in a bun for hours. Highly recommend.  
141. Love how great it cleans and smells wonderful.  
142. Used it a few times, and it just stopped working.  
143. It works! Not quick relief, but it does take the headache away. It’s not greasy or sticky.  
144. Great buy! Perfect size for many uses. The included earplugs are nice too.  
145. Bought this when I was low on cash and needed wick for my attys. It works great! No wicking time, super soft, and economically sound. I love my Cotton Bacon and Torii Wicks, but I’ll definitely keep this in stock.  
146. Love this for tender, aching feet. Big enough not to spill over.  
147. Great alternative soap.  
148. Simple, natural, organic ingredients. The flavor is good, just like other honey lemon lozenges I’ve tried. They even have silver to help fight infections. Handy and effective for fighting off sickness.  
149. Okay for a temporary fix. Buy a new chair—or better yet, make your company buy one (OSHA!).  
150. Love the size. This product is great and I’d buy it again.  
151. I diet and walk 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. It’s not a miracle pill, but if you change your eating habits and get a little active, it works over time.  
152. Have to nail on and remove old heel taps…meh.  
153. I have a Model 454 that’s at least 30 years old, and it still works! I’ve tried electric white noise makers, but they’re just not the same. Can't explain why, but this unit is great at blocking out noise in my bad neighborhood. I did a Google search for the Model 454, and it’s from the 1960s! Wow, I guess it’s lasted longer than I thought!  
154. There’s hate, but this is like classic Mac and cheese—liked it even more. Just basic noodles with fake cheese powder. Give it a try.  
155. Threw these away almost immediately after opening. Way too short! Didn’t fit at all.  
156. Hard to rate a vitamin unless it’s toxic. I’ve taken these for 3 days, and nothing’s happened. I assume they’re good Vitamin D3, which helps with calcium absorption and bone strength. I’ve been taking D3 for over 10 years, and my bone density is excellent. My doctor insists I take it daily.  
157. Felt great on my scalp! Definitely recommend.  
158. Ever been in a public restroom that ran out of soap? Nightmare for some of us, but this item is a lifesaver! So convenient to have in your purse—one sheet is all it takes to get your hands nice and clean.  
159. Ordered this for my furbaby since he only drinks water from a dropper. Droppers are hard to find around here. Usually, the ones for kids’ medicine cost more, but this one works great and is affordable. It came with a small brush for easy cleaning. Worth it!  
160. It’ll take me forever to use all these tags, but they’re gorgeous. Exactly what I was looking for.
161. Very nice dispenser, I keep it in my kitchen because it's a much more economical way to store and use paper towels.  
162. PROS: 1. Vegan, with no gelatin. 2. Tastes good, fresh, and chewy. 3. Moderate price range. 4. No iron. 5. Contains iodine, which is important for thyroid health. CONS: 1. This is a basic, gummy, adult multivitamin. You can get a very similar, generic version at your local big box store for about one-third the price. Here’s how I would write these reviews in my style, keeping the same meaning but with my unique touch:
163. I often check my blood pressure at pharmacies or other places with those little booths. I decided to get this monitor for home use to track my readings. It's simple to operate, fits my "larger" arm without any trouble, and has great memory settings for two users. The readings are always consistent, and it’s really comfortable to wear.
164. I absolutely love these bottles! The color is stunning.
165. The quality is excellent, and it feels really sturdy. I’m curious to see how it holds up over time, especially in the shower.
166. This was incredibly uncomfortable! The thick Velcro straps fold under your armpits, almost like wearing two belts around your arms. It was unbearable, and I couldn’t wear it for more than 10 minutes.
167. I’m really pleased with how affordable this product is, and the fact that it’s wireless makes it even better.
168. This was very uncomfortable for me. I’m a bigger woman with broad shoulders, and this was ridiculously small. It restricted circulation in my arms, and the Velcro even came loose in the back. I ended up getting a cheaper one that fit comfortably with proper adjustments. This one is really meant for smaller people.
169. I’ve struggled to find inserts that give good arch support to relieve my plantar fasciitis pain. This one is a game-changer. It has the perfect balance of firmness and cushioning, and the high arch support is exactly what I need. I wear a 9-9.5 shoe size, and these inserts fit perfectly in my boot-like slippers. At $17.84, they’re a great price for this level of comfort and support. I’m thrilled with them!
170. This device picks up a small amount of dirt from smooth surfaces, but it’s no match for a regular vacuum. Still, it’s handy for small jobs like picking up pet hair on a rug when I don’t feel like pulling out the big vacuum.
171. This bib is perfect for messy eaters!
172. I was told this supplement would help me absorb vitamins better, but I didn’t notice any change after using it.
173. Exactly what I needed to remove grout haze from my stone tiles. What would’ve taken me days to do by hand, I was able to accomplish in just a few hours.
174. No more bulky pockets! I love how these stack for easy storage, open with ease, and have fun pictures on them.
175. I bought these to remove black marks from my new office kitchen counter, which had gotten scratched by tin foil trays. Regular soap wasn’t working, but with a little elbow grease, the magic eraser got most of the marks off.
176. This product saves time and mess, but the price is outrageous. It’s probably just a few cents worth of plastic, and you could make something like it at home. I did have to drill out the hole because it was really difficult to get the caulking out as it was. Still, it made the job much easier, even though I wish the price wasn’t so high.
177. Not good at all.
178. I bought these for my sister, a practicing Wiccan, to use in her craft. These little glass bottles come pre-sorted with crystals, so you don’t have to sift through them. Each jar is labeled and sealed with a cute cork stopper. The gems are small enough for even tiny spell jars, and they’re polished, so there are no sharp edges.
179. I’ve really enjoyed using this organic peppermint and camphor lotion for massaging my shoulders and back! This is my first time trying it, and I’m pleasantly surprised and satisfied.
180. This toothpaste contains 5% potassium nitrate, which is the same ingredient used in most sensitive toothpastes to reduce tooth sensitivity. It works just like others, but it has a milder mint flavor and a softer consistency, with less foam. The lack of foaming might affect how well the potassium nitrate reaches all areas, but it still works. The tube looks large but only contains 3.5 oz, which is only about half full. It’s also hard to get the last bit out since the tube is plastic and doesn’t roll. While it does work, the drawbacks make it a 3-star product for me.
181. I haven’t seen a noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, even though I’ve been using this powder once a day. It’s very fine, though.
182. Vitamin D3 supplements in pill or tablet form upset my stomach, so I was excited to try these gummies. They taste great, dissolve easily, and don’t cause any stomach issues. Each serving gives me 2000 IU, and I love that they’re made with citrus fruit pectin. They’re reasonably priced, and I’m happy to add them to my daily routine.
183. This Maca is amazing! The gelatinized form helps with digestion, and I noticed a significant improvement in my energy and hormonal balance within just a few days. I even added it to my wife’s smoothies, and it helped with her fibromyalgia symptoms. I accidentally left it behind during a trip, and the positive effects started to fade, but as soon as I started using it again, the benefits returned. The price went up from $21 to $31 in just 3 months, which is frustrating, but they offer discounts on shipping if you order multiple units.
184. We do a lot of day trips, and with a baby who spits up frequently, this portable stain-fighting spray is a lifesaver. It’s great for stains you can’t immediately wash out, so no more worrying about clothes setting in stains when you’re on the go. This travel stain fighter is essential!
185. Great price, tastes good, and comes in nice packaging. I can’t speak to the benefits just yet since I’ve only just received it, but I’ve been taking pollen for a while, and it’s always been great.
186. The KAIRNE Reusable Cotton Rounds are fantastic for removing makeup. I’ve used them twice, and they’re super easy to use. I haven’t washed them yet, but they come with a convenient laundry bag. The rounds are stored in an adorable container with two types of lids—one stopper and one cover. You can even use them with a cleanser for face washing. I’ll definitely be recommending these to family and friends.
187. I gave this NAC 5 stars because it’s easy to swallow and doesn’t upset my stomach, which is a first. It’s the only NAC I’ve used that doesn’t have that awful rotten egg smell, though there’s still a subtle odor. It’s bearable, though.
188. I was told DGL Licorice would help with my acid reflux, but unfortunately, it didn’t work for me.
189. It’s a good product.
190. I initially enjoyed this, but I wanted to use it behind my head while driving or during lunch breaks, parked safely. The strap didn’t keep it in place, and the elastic band wore out quickly, causing it to drop too low. I couldn’t adjust it, so it became unusable.
191. This portable Breath Alcohol Tester is a great way to stay safe when you’re out. It’s lightweight and easy to carry in your purse, jacket, or car. You can quickly test yourself or others before driving. The LCD display shows accurate results, which gives peace of mind. It uses standard AAA batteries and is a reliable tool for self-checking.
192. Another great deal from BS. The glucosamine powder is excellent, and the price is unbeatable.
193. I have to take gummy supplements since pills upset my stomach. These taste like prunes and smell like sweet mushrooms, which isn’t my favorite, but it’s not a deal-breaker.
194. I ordered this on Thursday, and it arrived this morning. It screwed on perfectly, and it’s super soft. I love it!
195. There aren’t enough design color options for using them as decorative items, but aside from that, it’s a great product.
196. Every beard is different, and while I wish I had a beard like Chris Stapleton, mine isn’t quite there yet. I do love the Groomed and Tailored Beard Set, though. The quality of the tools is fantastic, especially the scissors. The set comes in a cloth bag for storage.
197. This cleaner is great for removing stickers and other stubborn marks from flat or slightly curved surfaces. The razor scraper makes quick work of stubborn adhesive. I’ve used it to remove registration stickers from cars and old vinyl decals from windows. The scraper holds the blades securely, preventing any accidental slips or cuts.
198. This doesn’t blink as advertised. Total waste of money.
199. Ginseng has brought me several benefits. It helps with morning sickness (I use pickled ginseng), and it’s great for boosting energy. The ginsenosides in Panax ginseng are natural anti-inflammatory compounds. I’ve always had good results with it, and it’s a great value. 
200. I’ve been using this for a while now. A tablespoon on an empty stomach works quickly. Since kava is fat-soluble, I take it with almond or coconut milk. For the price, it’s definitely worth it. Here’s how I would write the reviews in my style while keeping the meaning intact:
201. The scent fades within 30 minutes, which was a bit disappointing. I bought it for my New Zealand wool dryer balls, and while the smell is nice, I think it’s a bit overpriced considering the quality.
202. Be sure you want this before purchasing because, despite the listing stating it’s returnable, it actually isn’t.
203. This works great next to our kitty litter box! It’s quiet and efficient—highly recommend!
204. If you’re looking for something healthy, this is it! I use the Super Chlorella Powder in my smoothies with ingredients like organic frozen cherries, apple, carrot, celery, banana, and sometimes even cabbage. The taste of Chlorella on its own isn’t the best, but blended into a smoothie, it’s a great way to get my greens. It’s organic, rich in vitamins A and B12, and cracked-cell for easier absorption. No wheat or gluten either. It’s the perfect way to start my day!
205. I wanted to check my pH levels due to stomach issues, and I’m so glad I tried these test strips. The first day, I tested both my saliva and urine, and they were both around 5.5, indicating my system is acidic. It’s helpful to monitor pH levels, as an acidic system can lead to fatigue and headaches, while an alkaline system can cause joint pain and insomnia. These strips are easy to use and provide results in just 15 seconds. The bottle contains 200 strips and includes a helpful chart and directions. I’m now in the ideal pH range!
206. This Disney bag is so cute!
207. My lips have never been in such great condition—no more lines or peeling. This product is like silk on my lips! It truly works wonders!
208. I’ve been looking for an organic dandelion and milk thistle supplement, and this one is perfect. I’m sensitive to many things, but I haven’t had any adverse reactions to this. I don’t take them every day, but it’s nice to know I’m using a supplement that’s free from pesticides and chemicals.
209. This is the worst floss I’ve ever used. It’s so thin that you can barely clean between two teeth before it breaks. Even doubling it up doesn’t help—it still breaks. It’s more suitable for hanging Christmas decorations than for flossing your teeth!
210. I’m impressed—it actually works and relieves my pain.
211. I use this to make Muesli for breakfast, and I love that it’s organic.
212. The plastic seal was broken when I received this, and the twist seal on the lid didn’t line up with the grooves, so the whole lid came off. This caused about 15% of the bottle to leak, and when I opened the box, I could smell the lime. The scent is pleasant, though, and I would have given this 5 stars if it hadn’t leaked.
213. Bought these for my son, and he loves them!
214. Best powder ever! No more rash under my chest, especially in hot weather. I will always purchase and use this.
215. This first aid kit is so well-organized with everything you could need: antibiotic ointment, anti-bacterial wipes, cold compress, safety pins, gauze, and more. It even includes a printed guide for first aid instructions. I highly recommend keeping this kit on hand or using it when traveling!
216. My son is a doodler, and this was perfect for him.
217. I wasn’t sure what to expect, as I usually take B12 in pill form. The taste is good, but my only issue is that the dropper is supposed to measure 1mL, yet I can only get about 0.75mL.
218. It’s fine. The case closes securely, which is great since I carry it in my bag, where it gets jostled around with my books and laptop. I initially worried the pills would mix, but it wasn’t a problem. Cleaning it is a little tricky because of the corners, but that’s to be expected with this type of case. The black case isn’t fully opaque, and the + sign is mostly transparent, so if you want to hide the contents, this isn’t the right choice.
219. After struggling with waking up every night at exactly 3AM, I found an alternative medical doctor who recommended Hepa Trope for my liver. After two days of using it, I slept through the night without waking up at 3AM. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now, and it’s made a huge difference. The Amazon price is much better than what the doctor charges!
220. I use six diffusers in my home daily, and I’ve always bought oils from the same company. That was until I tried the oils from Salty Essential Oils. The Lemon scent in my hall bathroom was amazing, and the Frankincense and Bergamot also smelled fantastic. The scents last even after the diffuser has turned off. I love that each oil has a description of its benefits, such as promoting sleep or relieving headaches. What a pleasant surprise—I'm so glad I gave these a try!
221. Arrived on time, easy to use, and accurate. A great product. I’ll definitely order these again.
222. Exactly what I expected.
223. This works incredibly well for smelly shoes if you follow the directions. I washed my boots, and they started smelling a couple of days later. After using this for a few days, the smell was gone! It’s not a chemical product, but it works surprisingly well and leaves no powder residue, unlike other products.
224. Comfortable, easy to use, and provides great support.
225. It does exactly what it’s supposed to.
226. I can wear this TENS unit while shopping. The main device fits easily in my pocket, and setup is quick. I love the variety of modes, especially the deep tissue option. It’s great for relieving back pain when I pull a muscle. The pads last a long time, and it’s one of the better TENS units I’ve tried.
227. This cleaner works wonders on my Pandora jewelry, though it does smell like eggs. As long as you rinse the jewelry afterward, the smell disappears, and the jewelry looks amazing.
228. This did nothing for me.
229. My favorite part of this is the button that pops open the lid. It’s well-made and durable.
231. I’m impressed with how effective these liners are for their intended use. They have a silky, waterproof material on one side and a soft, fleecy fabric on the other. They're perfect for "low flow" days, which is where I feel most comfortable using them. For light coverage or as a daily liner, they’ve worked well.
232. Overall, this mop and bucket set is pretty solid. The mop itself is fantastic. The metal pole screws together really securely, and the threaded sections are recessed, which makes for a sturdy, long-lasting connection that won’t loosen during use. The mop head attaches using a snap-button, which is a good quality mechanism. My only gripe is the point where the pole meets the mop head—it's made of plastic. While it's thick and durable, I feel like a metal connection would have been sturdier since that's a potential weak spot. The mop head covers are well-made and attach firmly with Velcro, and you get two pads in the set. They’re machine washable, but I recommend hand washing them and letting them air dry flat to preserve their lifespan. The bucket design is where things could improve. It's smaller than similar models, which is a plus because it’s lighter when filled with water. However, it lacks some useful features like a drain hole at the bottom, and it’s difficult to remove the top for cleaning. The handle feels a little flimsy compared to other buckets I’ve used. Despite the bucket being a bit of a letdown, this is still a great mop set. It’s super easy to get the mop head into the bucket, thanks to its spring-loaded feature that allows it to fold vertically. The squeegee works well to wring out the water, and having separate wet and dry sides to the bucket speeds up the process and ensures a better clean. It’s not perfect, but it offers good value for the price.
233. This product is a great fit for our small RV! It’s made really well, too! The only issue I ran into is that our headrest is one solid piece, and getting it connected tightly is a bit of a challenge.
234. These aren’t returnable, so be sure to think this one through before buying. I bought them to replace an old Ace Bandage, but they’re way too short, slippery, and weak. I ended up going back to my old Ace Bandage, and now these are just going to be donated. Total waste of time and money.
235. I ordered these vitamins while I was away to ensure they’d be waiting for me when I got home. They’re recommended by health professionals for women, so I’m hoping they’ll live up to the hype.
236. This posture corrector is a bit tricky to get on at first, but once you get the hang of it, it really does work. It’s effective in providing relief from neck and shoulder pain, and it’s FDA approved too!
237. I wore this on flights in January during flu season and—miracle of miracles—I stayed healthy! No flu or URI this time. First time in three years that I’ve flown without getting sick!
238. At the start of the pandemic, when toilet paper was hard to come by, I ordered this bidet sprayer to reduce my TP use. I also got these washable bamboo makeup removers, which I keep in a cute little ceramic pot on the back of the toilet. They’re great for drying off after using the bidet. Plus, when used with a low-suds feminine wash, they help me stay fresh and minimize the need for frequent baths. Being retired and dealing with dry skin, I really don’t need to bathe more than once a week as long as I keep things clean down there. I like that I can sit on the toilet while doing this, reducing the risk of falling (I have osteoporosis). Plus, I hear some celebs are advocating for less frequent bathing, so I guess I’m ahead of the trend! The packs of makeup removers come with a mesh bag, which is super convenient for washing them. I’m really happy with this product and would give it an extra star if I could!
239. We don’t use anything else anymore—this product is the best! It’s a little more expensive, but it’s totally worth it. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky, it’s light, and it works wonders. The only downside is the smell. My daughter is sensitive to it and sometimes freaks out, but I assure her it’s all good, even though I’m often chasing her around!
240. I’m an adult with incredibly dry and sensitive skin, so I use baby lotion (per my doctor’s recommendation). This lotion almost worked for me, but it doesn’t provide the hydration I need. It feels okay when first applied, but within half an hour, my skin is just as dry as before. However, I do love the Sweet Apple body wash from this line—it’s honestly the best body wash I’ve ever used! Sadly, the lotion isn’t right for me.
241. The Motif Twist is a small, portable breast pump that’s lightweight and includes a one-piece flange with a comfort cushion. It can be battery-operated, which is handy for on-the-go use. While the pump itself is cute, it doesn’t come with accessories, so you’ll need to buy a tote and cooler separately. The pump is quiet and works well, but the suction can be a bit loud. It’s a closed pump, meaning milk doesn’t get into the tubing, which is great for hygiene. The parts are interchangeable with the Motif Curve, and the comfort cushion makes pumping more comfortable than other models. However, getting replacement parts can be difficult, and the pump is a bit limited in flange size options. Despite these issues, it’s a solid, portable pump that I’d recommend for anyone who can work with the available parts.
242. Shipping was incredibly fast, and I actually received three of these! Thank goodness, because one broke while I was figuring out how to use it, and the other got deformed. It makes a gorgeous bun, but the product isn’t sturdy enough for repeated use.
243. I needed a new shaker bottle, and this one has been great so far. It’s leakproof, which is awesome because I throw it in my gym bag without worrying about spills. The blender ball works just as well as others I’ve used, and I really like the non-slip grip on the sides and bottom. It makes it easier to hold, even when it’s all sweaty from condensation. My only wish is that there was a ring or loop on the bottle for an even better grip.
244. It works perfectly fine, and for the price, I’d definitely buy it again.
245. This stuff tastes amazing and really helps me power through my workouts.
246. The color is stunning, and the flakes are large! I’m in love with this product, and if I ever run out, I’ll definitely buy more.
247. This copper magnetic bracelet is beautiful, and after wearing it for just a day, I haven’t felt any pain in my fingers, which I sometimes struggle with. I’ll update this review as I continue using it.
248. The packaging is perfect for travel! A little goes a long way, so you’ll likely get more out of this pouch than expected. It’s easy to dispense, doesn’t irritate my dry, sensitive skin, and the fragrance is mild and fades quickly—no migraine triggers, which is a big plus. The lotion itself blends into my skin easily and leaves me feeling moisturized. But honestly, the best part is the packaging. It’s super convenient and hygienic, especially because I don’t need to dip my fingers into a jar every time.
249. Over the years, I’ve tried several different supplements, including a few free samples from Bulk Supplements. I recently decided to add horsetail to my regimen after hearing about its benefits for healthy teeth and gums. I wasn’t impressed with Bulk Supplements' version—it just didn’t feel fresh. After two weeks, I couldn’t really notice any difference. So, I decided to try a different brand, and the difference was night and day! The new one smells fresh and earthy, and I’m already seeing better results. Bulk Supplements' version just doesn’t cut it for me.
250. This product is essentially like using white-out on your teeth. Total waste of money!
251. Had to try the new flavors and was not disappointed! The sample pack is fantastic—same great BUZZ with delicious tastes. Tropical punch (green) remains my favorite. Perfect energy boost with no crash. Highly recommend for nights out or long study sessions.
252. This powdered coconut milk is a game-changer! It’s a great alternative to canned milk, easy to store, and works beautifully in Thai dishes. Just add warm water for rich flavor. Bonus: it’s non-GMO and vegan.
253. This diffuser fills my SUV with wonderful essential oil scents every day. I’ve been using it for five months, and it’s still going strong!
254. Simple and comfortable attachment for glasses. Works perfectly.
255. Great quality at a reasonable price.
256. Perfect for small messes and little hands to manage. Love these!
257. These bags were exactly what I needed for treats. They aren’t super sturdy but perfect for lighter uses. Would buy again.
258. Love this silicone facial brush! It’s gentle, effective, and easy to clean—even dishwasher safe. The suction feature for storage is a great touch.
259. Accurate, sleek, and user-friendly scales! They’re lightweight and easy to read, even in low light. A great buy.
260. This beet powder is fantastic! It mixes well into juices or recipes and stays fresh in its resealable package. Great for adding nutrients when fresh veggies aren’t available. 
261. Good cleats, but the tool is too weak to be effective. Consider getting a sturdier tool for installation.
262. Ordered this bulb for the SLVR410, but it didn’t fit. The manufacturer helped me get the correct part, so it worked out in the end. 
263. These Vitamin C gummies taste amazing—light and citrusy. The sugar coating keeps them from sticking, and the dosage is just right. A bit pricey but worth it for the quality.
264. As a night owl, this product is my secret weapon for early mornings. Works like a charm!
265. Be cautious with this product—it can cause headaches if combined with other supplements.
266. Purchased this sturdy case for essential oils, and it holds everything securely. The print is lovely, and the size is perfect for travel.
267. Soft packaging makes these easy to carry anywhere. Gentle on the skin and good value for the price.
268. This didn’t help with my milk supply. Stick to pure Fenugreek for better results.
269. Works great as a trimmer! My wife loves it for regular use, and it even worked on my face in a pinch. Practical and effective.
270. This ice roller is a lifesaver! It stays cold for ages and works wonders for injuries or cramps. Easy to use, clean, and store.
271. Nice overall, but I noticed some cosmetic defects. A bit disappointed.
272. Perfect for controlling odors in my basement with an XL litter box. Planning to purchase more for other areas.
273. A must-have for anyone managing multiple pills daily! Easy to use and travel-friendly, even for those with limited hand mobility.
274. Terrible quality—didn’t last a year despite following cleaning instructions. Won’t purchase from this company again.
275. Great product with lightning-fast delivery!
276. I recently switched back to natural nails and needed some good files. I was confident the 240 grit would work, and thankfully, the 180 grit did the job too. While the 180 side is a bit rough and not ideal for shaping, it works fine for shortening nails. The 240 grit is exactly what I was looking for, and it’s easy to tell the difference between the sides to avoid mistakes.
277. The photos were misleading. It only comes with one thick sheet, not as expected.
278. These earplugs are comfortable and block loud sounds while still allowing you to hear everything else. I use them multiple days a week and have had no issues. Highly recommend them.
279. These gloves are great! They’re long enough to handle dishes and other household chores, and you get two pairs in different colors, so you won’t mix up the kitchen and bathroom gloves. They keep my hands clean and do the job really well.
280. The plates are super small and flimsy, and the cups are tiny too. The napkins and banners are cute, but overall, the set was disappointing.
281. These gloves are easily adjustable, not too tight, and resize with ease.
282. The only reason this cane holder gets a single star is because there isn’t an option for zero stars. The design is poor, it lacks instructions, and the construction is subpar. Don’t waste your money on this item.
283. I bought these sleeves for my dad and they’ve made a huge difference for his circulation. I’ve used these for other body parts like my knees and elbows, and they’ve really helped with recovery and comfort. I recommend them to everyone dealing with circulation issues. They’re also the same material used by soldiers in cold environments to keep their feet warm without sweating. The quality is excellent, and I’ve shared them with others across the country who’ve had similar experiences. I’m a big fan of this brand! 
284. This toothbrush is fantastic! It helps get food out of tricky spots, especially with my lower gums that have metal inserts. I plan on buying more of these because they come from another country, so delivery takes a while. But they’re worth the wait! 
285. These brittle treats are a unique mix between candy and cookies. They’re delicious, though my favorite flavor is chocolate chip. The only downside is that they’re so good, I want to eat the entire bag at once!
286. I absolutely love this brush. With thick, wavy hair, blow-drying and straightening usually takes me forever. But with this brush, I cut the time down drastically. It gets my hair straight without any burns, and it even works on hair that’s a little damp. It’s honestly a game-changer for my hair routine, and I recommend it to anyone who struggles with time-consuming hair fixes.
287. I have two GermGuardian sanitizers, one in each of my kids’ rooms. They help reduce odors (like baby diapers) and seem to contribute to us rarely getting sick. They also act as a subtle night light. I’ve been using mine for over a year with minimal maintenance, and it’s still working great. If the price drops again, I’ll buy one for my own room too.
288. I knew this nail kit would be small, and it was, but it’s still a nice selection of products to try. It would also make a great gift for anyone who loves experimenting with their nails.
289. I bought this degreaser to clean old Schwinn Stingray bike parts and it’s amazing! It melts even the toughest grease. Now I use it everywhere—on motorcycle parts, car engines, and even grill tools. A gallon lasts a long time, and it’s become an essential item in my home for any greasy task.
290. These organizers are perfect for keeping things tidy while traveling and also work well for organizing at home.
291. Quick shipping and great quality product, exactly what I needed.
292. This air purifier is incredible. It’s been great for tackling odors in small rooms, including one with dirty laundry. I’ve used similar units, but this one’s been reliable and effective. I’m planning to buy another one soon.
293. This detergent is a good value, though it didn’t help with stains in a porcelain sink. Still, it works wonderfully for laundry and is worth the price.
294. Just like the one I was using before—very happy with it.
295. A great deal for two units that do exactly what they’re supposed to do. I’m satisfied with this purchase.
296. My kids love these, and I’m sure they’ll keep using them for years. I might even buy stock in this brand!
297. I wish I had this product years ago. It’s perfect for stopping mosquito bite itching. If you use it right away, the itching disappears completely (though there may still be some swelling). It’s so easy to use, and I prefer this one with finger loops for easier application. It’s a great price, especially since it comes with three. I keep one in my purse, car, and first aid kit. This is a purchase you won’t regret! 
298. This is a lightweight, portable, and fairly durable unit. It's perfect for light tasks like those around the house or for handyman work. As an electrician, it works great for my occasional carpentry needs. 
299. Absolutely love it! ❤❤❤
300. I gave this as a gift, so I don’t know the full details, but it’s a beautiful color.
301. After researching fisetin’s health benefits, I found limited studies, and the results weren't very conclusive. However, I chose this product primarily for its quercetin content, as it’s great for helping zinc enter cells to combat and eliminate viruses. It works wonderfully when paired with vitamin C, D3, and zinc, which I take daily.
302. Excellent product!
303. I tried a free sample of the Dragonfruit flavor, and it tasted like Band-Aid smell, which was quite off-putting. Initially, I thought it was just another sparkling water, but after realizing it was marketed as a health drink, I gave it another try. Unfortunately, the taste didn’t improve, and I couldn’t finish the can.
304. Since the pandemic, I've been regularly taking D3 pills. Not all D3 supplements are equal, but these are great—easy to swallow, no aftertaste, and small enough not to be a hassle. They’re strong (5,000iu), and I feel they help protect against germs. While they’re not a guarantee against COVID, every little bit helps. We haven’t caught it yet, and I plan to continue using them for safety.
305. After falling a few weeks ago, I’ve had leg pain, so I bought this cushion for my seat at work. Unfortunately, it’s too thick, which causes discomfort on my legs. I’ll be returning it because it wasn’t comfortable for me.
306. I never thought I’d write a review about earplugs, but they’re that good. With sensitive hearing, even moderate noise bothers me. I always carry a pair, whether I'm at a coffee shop or on a plane. These earplugs are comfortable, block enough sound for peaceful sleep, yet allow for conversation if worn loosely. They come with neat cases, and I’ve been using them for nearly a year. Highly recommended.
307. After hearing about UV lights on a news show, I bought this affordable plug-in for an area with puppy pads. It worked quietly and effectively, and I appreciate that the UV bulb is replaceable. I’ve ordered another one for the bathroom. Update: The plug can rotate, so it fits both outlet orientations. Thanks to Merry C for the tip!
308. I liked the idea of having earplugs attached to a cord for easy access, but the plug keeps coming out and won’t stay in. I didn’t notice much noise reduction compared to regular earplugs, and my voice and the patients’ voices were muffled. I had to remove my gloves after using the Cavitron to talk.
309. Exactly what I needed.
310. This ice pack is okay, but it becomes too hard after a few hours in the freezer. It’s not my favorite.
311. Fast results with no issues with dye runoff.
312. I got this spray during an Amazon deal, and it’s fantastic. It was worth every penny, even though it’s a bit pricey. I hope it goes on sale again!
313. I love these lens cleaners. The moisture level is perfect and doesn’t leave streaks, unlike other wipes that were too wet and left streaks.
314. The lavender scent is wonderful, and I love the little towel that comes with it. A great investment for your mat!
315. I’ve used these several times, and they completely block the light while being very comfortable. They helped me get the best sleep I’ve ever had on a plane. The soft silk doesn’t cause distractions like other sleep masks.
316. Like most stain removers, this one works best on fresh stains. It worked okay on a recent stain, but didn’t do anything for an old grease stain. The small bottle is handy for travel, though, and it’s good for mild, recent stains when you don’t have other options.
317. Creates nice bubbles, and the message is good.
318. Not waterproof, so your medication could melt in the rain. However, it’s useful for most situations, and the mirror bright interior lid is handy for quick fixes.
319. I found this difficult to use, and it pulled my hair.
320. Great variety of popular watch band pins.
321. This four-pack of bamboo bath sponges is a great deal. I use them every year, and they foam up well with shower gel. They also have a ribbon for easy hanging and draining.
322. Good quality at a great price—suitable for both adults and children.
323. This didn’t work at all. It seemed to attract more cats, and I wouldn’t recommend it.
324. I use it for everything—it's the best.
325. This supplement is great for your health, and the supplier is fantastic. It helps curb your appetite, promotes clear skin, and encourages hair growth.
Here’s the next batch of reviews:
326. I tried these pills to curb my appetite, and while it's tough to remember to take them every day, I gave them a fair shot. They definitely helped reduce my appetite, though the smell is so bad it makes you not want to eat anyway. It also helped with detox and bathroom trips, but it's not something I could add to my regular routine. Still, if you're looking to lose a few pounds or detox, it's worth a try.
327. I love that this flat iron is cordless! It heats up fast and is easy to pack. The only downside is the smaller heating plate, which I'm still getting used to. For the occasional use, like straightening my bangs, the charge lasts long. Overall, a solid flat iron.
328. I love these oils, but the price has gone up. They aren't greasy and work well on sensitive skin, making them a great option for skin care.
329. The color is pretty, but the product unraveled after the second use. Disappointing.
330. The plug doesn't fit properly into the wall, which was frustrating.
331. I mixed this with water and milk, and it blended well. My wife, who is picky about these things, liked it too. It's made in the USA, which I appreciate. The added fiber and vitamins are a nice bonus, though the price is a bit high at almost two dollars per serving. We'll keep using it for the fiber benefits.
332. Ridiculous. One sheet didn’t do anything. You need at least 15 sheets to make a difference.
333. I’ve been using Clear Care for years to clean my contacts, and I’ve never had an eye infection. However, I deducted a star because the double pack only comes with one case, and I think there should be two.
334. Very deceiving. The product looks poorly painted, with rubber glued to mediocre glass.
335. Well packaged, arrived early. Great price and smells lovely.
336. There are 30 champagne gold boxes and 120 clear stickers in this set. They’re great for wrapping Christmas gifts or cookies. I like them but the bottom is a bit flimsy and needs extra reinforcement. Each box holds about a pound of cookies or four cupcakes. Good value for the price.
337. I haven’t read this book yet, but based on my past love for "Hyperbole and a Half," I know I’ll enjoy it. Can’t wait for it to be available!
338. I didn’t see any change with the whitening pen, although it does have a pleasant taste. Unfortunately, it didn’t work for me.
339. This toner is amazing! It hydrates my skin without drying it out, leaving it moist and clean. A perfect daily toner for sensitive skin.
340. Great for layout.
341. The spray nozzle is uneven and leaks big globs of oil. It takes a lot of sprays to cover the mat, so this will only last a few uses. The microfiber towel is too big and not very nice. Overall, I don’t recommend this product.
342. The packaging was different from what was pictured, but the fragrance and lather are great. I’d love to see it packaged in a glass jar for aesthetic purposes.
343. I've been using Cloverine Salve my whole life, passed down from my mom. It works for nearly everything except burns after they’ve started healing. Definitely worth it!
344. They’re great for the price.
345. This chair pad is perfect if you sit for long periods, especially with a computer. It maintains its shape and is worth the price.
346. I received the Cascade Complete as advertised. It works well.
347. The product is pretty wobbly.
348. The attachments stopped working after one use, which was disappointing.
349. I bought a generic eyeglass case from Amazon, but it didn’t fit my Gunnar MLG Phantoms. I’m happy I found the official case; it’s made of leatherette, feels nice, and gives my glasses plenty of room.
350. This VG is good quality for mixing e-liquid. I’ve used it before and am pleased with it for the price.
351. This grabber is great for picking up trash on walks. It collapses easily when not in use and keeps the bag open. Perfect for neighborhood cleanups.
352. They’re fine.
353. I’ve been using OXO squeegees for years, and this new Linea one comes with a suction cup and a sleek design. It works well, but the handle feels fragile, and it’s a bit heavy. I still prefer my OXO squeegees, but this one does the job.
354. Great task lighting with adjustable settings. It’s perfect for next to a chair, and I hope the replacement bulb is affordable.
355. This facial cleansing brush works wonderfully. My face feels so clean afterward. The kit comes with three brush heads and a charger, and I would recommend it to anyone.
356. This is a fantastic essential oil company. Their lemon oil smells amazing and works well in my homemade body butters. I use it often and love it.
357. My daughter loves the Megan soccer champ figure. It's her favorite!
358. I tried this posture corrector, but it was too tight in the armpit area for me. I’m a petite 5'1" and 125 lbs, so it may just not be the right fit. It could work for others, though.
359. I finally tried the Magic Eraser, and it’s incredible! It cleaned makeup stains off my sink and melted plastic off my toaster oven with ease. This product truly lives up to its name.
360. It did a nice enough job.
361. I love this cute diaper print!
362. I need electrolytes when I play tennis, especially in the heat. These electrolyte drops taste fine, and they have potassium and sodium, which will be great for my spring and summer matches.
363. This healing lotion is refreshing and non-greasy. It’s great for dry hands and feet, and I love applying it throughout the day.
364. I wasn’t sure about this hat, but I love it! It’s perfect for sun protection and still stylish for my summer outings.
365. This floss shredded in my husband’s teeth, which was disappointing. We had to use Glide floss to get it out.
366. I ordered a small but received a medium or large, which was a little too big for me.
367. Garcinia Cambogia is a tropical fruit that I’ve been using to curb my appetite. I’ve noticed more energy and a suppressed appetite after a few days, and I mix it with yogurt and shakes.
368. This rolling paper holder was too large for most papers, only fitting extra-long ones. I had to buy a smaller one but was happy with the product quality.
369. The Dental Duty Teeth Whitening Kit has worked well for my wife. After six sessions, she has seen significant results. It’s easier to use than gels, and there’s no draining into the mouth. She’s happy with the product and looking forward to finishing the full week.
370. The flavor of this gum is intense, which I actually prefer. The flavor lasts a while, and the packaging is recyclable.
371. I've seen many people use these, and they seem really happy with them. I needed one myself because I get so uncomfortable on planes. I'm looking forward to using this, especially since it comes with an eye mask and earplugs. When you’re on a plane for hours, sleeping becomes a priority. This should make it easier for me.  
372. This is my second time buying bath bombs. The first time I tried Lush, which was great but pricey. I decided to try Ikalula, and I really like them! They have sweet scents and different colors. "Sweet Orange" is my favorite! I love all citrus scents, especially orange and lemon. These bath bombs leave my skin soft and help me relax after a bath. I'll definitely buy them again.  
373. The hair dryer arrived securely packaged, and it even came with a cute velvet travel bag. It’s a digital blow dryer, so you can control the temperature. It’s so lightweight, it feels like I’m not holding anything when I use it for my wigs. The color of the dryer is eye-catching, and it comes with two attachments: a smooth nozzle and a diffuser. It dries my hair quickly. Highly recommend this seller!  
374. I tried it on a window and a wreath, and it was a mess! It never dried, just stayed wet.  
375. I put this product in the fridge for about 24 hours. I took one out, and the label peeled off easily, which was nice. Unfortunately, the taste was horrible. I’ve had bad drinks before, but this one was the worst. It tasted chalky, bitter, and had a weird sour chemical aftertaste that lingered for hours. I ended up throwing the other bottles away. I do not recommend this product.  
376. I use this product for long runs, and it works great!  
377. Brew it with hot water for a lung cleanse.  
378. I’ve tried the premade version, so I wasn’t too surprised by the powdered version. Some reviews claim it tastes terrible, but I had a different experience. When blended, the taste is almost identical to the premade version. Using a shaker cup doesn’t blend it as well, but it still works if you just need a quick, satisfying shake to curb your hunger. I use two scoops as a meal replacement and one scoop to stave off snacking. It’s not as creamy as the premade version, but it likely has fewer additives. Unfortunately, I’ve experienced stomach discomfort, so I can’t use it as often. Taking an enzyme pill and a probiotic before helps with the gas.  
379. A month ago, my blood pressure was 140/80, and I had heart issues. I started taking a potassium and magnesium supplement and saw some improvement. Then I read *The Magnesium Miracle* by Dr. Carolyn Dean and switched to liquid magnesium. I saw even better results, and my blood pressure dropped to 110/60. My doctor reduced my blood pressure medication. If you take this product and have high blood pressure, consult your doctor, as your meds might need adjustment. I started slowly with small doses and gradually worked up to 1/2 teaspoon a day. I also found that mixing it in coconut water helped calm my anxiety. This magnesium doesn’t have the typical laxative effect, which is a plus. Overall, my experience has been positive.  
380. This scrub works wonders on gold! It gets into corners and removes the shine.  
381. The gloves are a bit small, but the pot holder mitts work really well. However, they don’t have silicone strips to help grip the dish. They’re still a good product, though.  
382. As a nursing student, I bought this hemostat for my uniform. I haven’t used it yet, but it looks great and everyone compliments its black color. The quality seems excellent, and I’d recommend it to others.  
383. This is awesome! Exactly what I needed, and it works wonders for relaxing my muscles.  
384. It's still sitting in my bathroom. The instructions are confusing, and all the bottles have the same description. I’m likely going to throw it away.  
385. My baby hated this. I thought it would be easier than a regular toothbrush, but it didn’t work well at all.  
386. The shipping was awful! The product arrived loose in the package with the lid off, causing it to leak. It seems to work well, though, just be aware that you may have less product after shipping.  
387. These ashwagandha gummies taste great! The texture is more like soft candy than a typical gummy, which makes them very chewy. Ashwagandha helps calm me down and improves my sleep. I’ve also read that it can help reduce panic attacks.  
388. This package has a nice variety of dental products for dogs.  
389. These dry wipes are excellent! They’re strong, absorbent, and versatile. They’re softer than I expected but still durable. They don’t tear or leave lint behind and can be used in the garage, kitchen, bathroom, or office. Very impressed with the quality.  
390. When my kale powder arrived, it looked a bit pale compared to fresh kale, but I decided to give it a try. I mixed a teaspoon into 12oz of water, and surprisingly, it tasted fresh and sweet! I hope it’s pure organic kale powder, as it tastes far better than many other green powders I’ve tried. No bitterness at all. I'm happy with my purchase. The pound bag will likely last me a long time.  
391. These work great for making slide sandals fit better! One of my feet is slightly larger on top than the other, and this helped make both sandals fit comfortably.  
392. I bought this for my wife, and she loves it! The colors are cool, and it offers great protection for her phone. She previously had the OE Samsung flip case, which didn’t protect her phone at all. This case has a magnet that keeps it securely closed. It’s not the best build I’ve seen, but for the price, it’s a good option.  
393. I bought this terrible light. It worked for one month, then stopped working. Bad product.  
394. These earplugs are great, especially for swimmers and showering! I have swimmer’s ear, and these come with a cool metal container and a light neck strap for convenience. Just put the plugs in your ears and shower or swim, then hang them up to dry.  
395. This stuff really works. I never leave home without it!  
396. Along with an autoimmune diet, this probiotic is helping me treat and even reverse my autoimmune disease.  
397. The title says it all.  
398. Unfortunately, these mouth tapes are useless. They don’t stay on, and they don’t breathe, causing sweating. Eventually, they’ll come off and disrupt your sleep.  
399. I didn’t find it helpful. I bought it for the ends of my hair, but saw no improvement. It’s not the company’s fault—it’s just the oil.  
400. This small box is perfect for gifts, especially if you’re looking for something simple.  
401. I love using citrus essential oils because they brighten up the room and leave everything smelling fresh. I put it in my aromatherapy humidifier during the day, and the scent is uplifting. It's a good size for the price and definitely adds a positive atmosphere.  
402. I bought this to make my own stevia tinctures using the leaves I grow in my garden. I’ve tried alcohol, but it never seems to get rid of the taste. I heard glycerin might work better, so I’m giving it a try. I’m excited to make my first batch soon! The taste isn’t as sweet as people claim, but maybe it’s just my taste buds. This large bottle is great value, and I’m saving money making my own tinctures. No heat is needed, just mix it with the herb, and it’s super easy!  
403. I started off really liking this trimmer, but after a year of use (about once a month), the main trimmer head broke, leaving it mostly useless. It worked fine initially, but now I’m disappointed in the quality, especially considering the price.  
404. It’s lightweight but very short, even with the adjustable telescopic handle.  
405. Love them!  
406. What a set! These reading glasses arrived earlier than expected and were well-packaged. The price is incredible, and the quality is impressive. Each one is thoughtfully crafted, and I’m really happy with this purchase. Bravo!  
407. I bought this device to help with my neck pain, but it turned out to be a great travel pillow too! I used it on my recent flight, and it helped stretch my neck and relieve tension. It’s small enough to fit in my handbag and can be used at home or the office. Highly recommended!  
408. This is a solid product, and it provides good protection.  
409. These wraps were a huge disappointment. As an esthetician, I need durable wraps, but these snagged easily. After just one wash, they looked terrible, and I had to throw them away. They don’t hang properly either.  
410. Great quality tools for emergencies when you need to clamp off a "bleeder."  
411. The device wasn’t accurate. It was too tight on my wrist and sometimes restarted itself. I returned it for a refund and ended up buying a different one.  
412. The replacement toothbrush heads for Philips Sonicare are a great value. They fit perfectly and are good quality. I’d definitely buy them again.  
413. As a guy, exfoliating is often a chore, but after using *The Body Bar – Exfoliating Body Scrub Loofah & Moisturizing Body Wash Soap 2-in-1* for the first time, I was hooked! It exfoliates gently and leaves my skin moisturized with Shea Butter, Aloe, and Vitamin E. It’s a great everyday skincare product for both men and women. I highly recommend it!  
414. I hoped this would help with stress incontinence, but after using five of them, I’m still not seeing the results I expected. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I’ll keep trying to figure out if it’s user error.  
415. I love using essential oils before my yoga practice, and this combination is perfect. It’s fresh, clean, and balancing—great for both men and women since it’s not floral. I put it on both wrists, and it’s soothing yet energizing.  
416. I’m happy with this product. It came with a small booklet on how to stretch with it, which is great for getting the most out of it. Rolling my back and hamstrings with it feels fantastic, and it does a great job of decompressing my spine. I’m glad I chose this one and hope it holds up well.  
417. These were packaged really cute, but unfortunately, that’s about where the positives end. They smell unpleasant and all have the same scent. If they get too wet, they disintegrate in seconds. The scent barely lingers, and I could barely smell anything in the shower. Definitely not worth it.  
418. These are the best shower scrubs I’ve ever used! This is my second time buying them. They exfoliate without being harsh, lather up nicely, and don’t fall apart. A great deal!  
419. I love it! It really helps with pain and muscle strain.  
420. It’s not more powerful than the battery-powered version. If you're thinking it’ll give you more power because it’s corded, you’ll be disappointed. It’s essentially the same as the battery model but with a cord. I returned it and stuck with the battery-powered one.  
421. These daily supplements are great and hard to forget to take. They’re a bit larger than most, but very concentrated, making them the biggest pills I take that aren’t chewable.  
422. It’s even better in person than in the photos. It’s super cute, and I’d definitely consider giving it as a gift.  
423. This product is fine if used correctly, but it’s easy to make a mistake. I mixed it up with my regular solution, and as the label clearly says, you shouldn’t use it for that purpose. I just wanted to warn others to be careful.  
424. This is the best vitamin C supplement I’ve found so far.  
425. It was a little tight at first, but after wearing it a couple of times, it fits fine.  
426. I’m in my late 40s and need reading glasses to see up close. I got a vanity mirror with 5x magnification, and I was shocked to see blackheads on my temples! I used this ultrasonic skin scrubber, and it worked wonders for clearing them out. It didn’t leave any redness and was much more effective than acne tools. It even shows all the dirt on the tip after use. I love it and highly recommend it!  
427. A good product!  
428. These have a great taste and provide good value. I highly recommend them for supporting the whole family’s immune system, especially during uncertain times.  
429. Just as advertised and very useful.  
430. I’ve used Magic Eraser for years, and it always worked great. I tried a cheaper imitation, but it crumbled too much. So, I went back to the original. Unfortunately, this time, it wasn’t as effective for removing scuff marks off sneakers, and it crumbled more than I remember. I think the ones with the blue scrubber side are better, so I’ll try those next.  
431. The scent of this product is very strong and fruity, with a slight medicinal undertone. It’s not unbearable, but it’s intense enough to fill the whole house after just a few spritzes in the shower. While it does leave the shower glass clean and clear, I’ve used other daily products that work just as well without such a strong smell. I won’t be buying this again.
432. I absolutely adore the scent of this sandalwood oil. It's just the right strength—not too overpowering, but noticeable enough across the room. The product comes in a generous-sized, leak-proof glass bottle with a handy dropper included.
433. The taste of this glucosamine supplement is unbearable. It’s harsh, bitter, and overwhelmingly unpleasant. I really thought I could power through it, but it’s so bad that I would recommend just spending a little more money on the capsules instead. It’s not worth the discomfort.
434. I really like these masks. The design and colors are appealing, and the material is thick and comfortable to wear. These are perfect for cooler weather, made of 100% cotton, and priced reasonably at $7.50 each for a pack of two.
435. The two-pack option works well for households with multiple users. The product also contains “the mother,” which is said to be the most effective form of apple cider vinegar. It has helped with digestion, though I haven't noticed any weight loss effects. The flavor is mild, with a slightly sweet undertone. However, the size is smaller than most, and the instructions could be clearer.
436. I use this product for restless legs, and it seems to work pretty well. It’s a great value compared to other options I’ve seen at the store.
437. This blackhead remover vacuum is fantastic. It comes with an app that lets you connect to a 20x magnifying camera, so you can actually watch blackheads, whiteheads, and makeup being sucked out of your pores. The suction power is excellent, and it takes only a few minutes to clean your entire face. It’s durable and a great gift. Very satisfied with this purchase.
438. I bought this cushion for my father, who is wheelchair-bound and suffers from painful sores. After trying several other foam and gel cushions, this is the first one that has actually made him comfortable. I’m extremely grateful for this affordable and effective product.
439. If you have smaller glasses like I do, finding the right clip-on sunglasses can be tricky. These fit perfectly, though you may need to adjust the clips to fit over thicker lenses. Keep in mind, the coating on the sunglasses can scratch easily, so store them carefully when not in use.
440. As an ER nurse who works long shifts, compression socks are essential. After trying many brands, these are by far my favorite. They provide excellent support and comfort throughout my entire shift.
441. This footstool has been a great purchase. It’s very stable, and I feel completely safe using it.
442. The scent of this product is wonderful and very relaxing. It fills the house with a calming fragrance. I was also lucky enough to get it at a discount, which made it an even better buy.
443. This sonic cleaner is amazing. It’s waterproof, soft, and works wonderfully to clean items. I particularly love the special purple edition, but it’s no longer available. You can still get it in black or pink.
444. Just one squirt of this product is all you need to cover up bathroom odors. It’s not loaded with harsh chemicals or artificial fragrances. One spray lasts much longer than other air fresheners I’ve used.
445. This eye mask is a solid option for a budget-friendly sleep aid. It blocks out light effectively thanks to its soft material and a flannel insert. The mask fits comfortably on my head, though it’s a bit loose, which I prefer. However, the pressure caused by the elastic around my eyes became uncomfortable over time. Still, it’s a good option for short naps or rest breaks.
446. These look great but are difficult to put on and don’t stay up well. The fit is too tight for me. I prefer compression socks in the 10-20 mmHg range instead.
447. At first, I thought this product was a joke due to the quirky image of a hipster holding a green smoothie. Turns out it’s a legitimate meal replacement powder. I felt silly for thinking it was a gag gift, but now I’m actually using it. It’s a decent option for meal replacement.
448. These plates and napkins were perfect for a birthday celebration. They added a nice touch to the party.
449. These are fantastic—no complaints at all. 
450. This gel pack waistband is an excellent product for heat or cold therapy. It’s made of durable material and comes with a large gel pack, which provides great relief for lower back pain. It’s easy to use, and I appreciate how quickly it helps soothe pain. Highly recommend this for anyone dealing with back discomfort.
451. This product has a nice, subtle lemony scent and taste. It’s easy to take, making it a pleasant addition to my routine.
452. This case is perfect for storing items in your purse or briefcase, and it’s convenient for attaching to a belt for outdoor hikes. I would definitely recommend it.
453. This organizer is very helpful for keeping track of my pills. It’s simple, functional, and serves its purpose well.
454. This product wasn’t exactly what I was looking for, but it still works fine.
455. If you need gloves to handle clay or other artistic materials, these silicone gloves are great. They come in three sizes and are reusable, which makes them eco-friendly. The set includes small, medium, and large sizes, and I like that they’re washable.
456. Vegetable Glycerin is a versatile, odorless liquid derived from plants. I use it in my vapor juice (e-juice) and find it works great for creating more vapor than propylene glycol. It’s also perfect for mixing with essential oils to make moisturizers and hair conditioners. It has a shelf life of 12-18 months when stored properly.
457. This support is great for giving back support when it loosens up. The hand pump worked for about a year and a half before it stopped working. Still, I like the support it gives when it’s in use.
458. I like this product but don’t love it. It tends to move around too much and causes fatigue in sensitive areas. I can only use it for about four hours a day before it becomes uncomfortable.
459. I really did not like this cordless auto curler. The instructions were vague, and my hair got caught in it despite following the video tutorial. It damaged my hair, and I would not recommend this product to anyone.
460. I bought this for my son, but he hasn’t told me if there’s something wrong with the charging cord or battery. I still haven’t received any feedback from the seller, so I’m unsure what the issue is.
461. These inserts are reusable, though it’s a bit tricky to get them back together. They don’t fit all bottle types, so just be careful.
462. Perfect for cleaning my beret—works wonders!
463. The filter works well enough in our shower. It doesn’t affect my husband much since he’s shorter, but I’m tall, and it hangs just above my head. While the spray isn’t as diffuse as before, installation was easy. It’s reassuring to know that chemicals are being filtered out, even though we don’t have hard water. I plan to order more just to keep on hand.
464. This is a great addition to my emergency supply kit. It fits perfectly and is built solid. I’ve snapped it onto a 5-gallon bucket for my kit and plan to get another for camping trips. No more squatting outdoors!
465. I’m happy with the clipper’s performance, especially the ability to store clippings. However, I thought I was getting two different sizes—one for fingernails and one for toenails—but both are the same size. I haven’t tried cutting toenails yet, but it’s easy to figure out how to empty it.
466. It’s a great product, but I was a little disappointed that the batteries don’t work continuously. It seems like there might be a short in the battery compartment.
467. The color is good, and it stays secure in my pocket. That’s all that matters to me.
468. I would give this product fewer stars if I could. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.
469. The stones are too heavy to wear as a necklace. I thought they’d be smaller, but they’re uncomfortable and too bulky for my neck. I’m 6 feet tall and muscular, and it didn’t work for me.
470. These storage bags are excellent—each one has a slider closure and the Cowboys emblem. The bottom expands, so they stand up on their own, making them perfect for storing various items. The bags feel a bit thinner than other brands, but they still get the job done. At $9.99 for 20 bags, they’re a great deal.
471. These were uncomfortable for both my husband and me. We couldn’t adjust them to fit, so we couldn’t use them.
472. Fantastic product! Exactly what I needed—thank you!
473. This balm is a must-have for everything—baby bum, cuts, scrapes, chapped lips, and hands. It works for so many uses!
474. If your mask hurts your ears or is too tight, this silicone ear-saver package is a great solution. I love that it’s adjustable and perfect for those of us with long hair, as it keeps the strap at the back of my neck.
475. I would give it five stars if it moisturized better. I have to reapply it often. I’ve been looking for a vegan lip balm that compares to Burt’s Bees, but this isn’t it.
476. These gloves are really helpful for dishwashing. I have small hands, but they fit well and stay on even though they’re a bit bigger than I need. They hug my hands and are comfortable.
477. These connecting strips are exactly what I needed. Before, my mask wouldn’t stay on, but now it does. I’m very happy with these strips.
478. I’ve used Milk Thistle in various forms—capsules, tea, and glycerite—but this powdered form is a great addition. I mixed it into soup and smoothies, and it worked well. I wouldn’t recommend baking with it since high heat could destroy its antioxidants. The packaging is great, and it’s a good value for the amount.
479. These aren’t terrible. With such a small amount, I can gulp it down quickly. I had to look up what “predigested hydrolyzed protein” is. It’s protein broken down to amino acids for easier absorption.
480. It works okay, but nothing beats Goddard’s. That was uniquely effective.
481. I really like these, though I docked one star because they’re pretty heavy.
482. It worked pretty well, but I’m not sure if I’ll buy it again.
483. These FG Clean Wipes are fantastic for cleaning so many things. They’re lint-free, durable, and reusable. I’ve used them to clean essential oil diffusers, my nail table, and even my fridge. One cloth lasts a long time. Highly recommend these wipes!
484. I normally wouldn’t rate tissues, but these are amazing! They’re soft, thick, and moisturizing. I wish I’d gotten them earlier, especially for allergy season. They’re also great for removing makeup. The cube boxes are perfect for my home and save time and money in the long run.
485. The red bag is the only one with major decoration—very 3D and eye-catching. The other two are simple and boring. Not worth $12, in my opinion.
486. I bought these bulbs for my home office because the yellow highlighter was hard to see under warm CFL light. The light is much whiter, and when combined with a “warm” CFL in a two-bulb fixture, the results are great. However, the bulbs were poorly packed, and one arrived broken. Amazon replaced it, but the second one arrived broken too. I hope the third time’s a charm!
487. I didn’t like the feel of these straws on my tongue. They’re not perfectly smooth, so I won’t be using them.
488. I absolutely love this cordless dog grooming kit! It has different clipper settings, a nail clipper and file, a comb, and sharp scissors. It held a strong charge throughout the entire grooming process for my fluffy dog. It’s also not very loud, so my dog stayed calm. Just note that it doesn’t come with an outlet adapter, but I used my iPhone plug to charge it.
489. These sticks work great for cleaning my smaller fish tanks. They’re plastic, so they won’t disintegrate and are reusable if cleaned properly. Very happy with these!
490. I live near a train yard, so I enjoy background noise when I sleep. Some sounds are perfect for me, but a few are a little too crisp. If the unit were placed further away or in the hallway, it might sound better.
491. This doesn't offer much support. It would be better to invest in a full foot support instead.
492. As a Packers fan since the Vince Lombardi era, I was beyond excited when I saw Ziploc's Packers storage bags! Couldn't pass it up.
493. So far, so good. My husband, who smokes, has struggled with congestion since a cold. After trying this NAC product, I noticed improvements in his breathing, and he's coughing less. At first, the 600mg dose made him cough too much, so we adjusted to just one per day. No issues now! However, I was disappointed that the promised $25 Amazon gift card promotion didn’t work due to a broken website. Otherwise, great results!
494. Works great and holds well—no complaints here!
495. It slides around too much on the bottom of my foot, which makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear.
496. I’ve been using it in the shower, and it works well, but after a while, it stopped working unexpectedly. While it was functional, I was really disappointed by its short lifespan.
497. This set of roll-on fragrances includes Real Love, Citrus Glow, and Frankincense. I love the orange aroma of Citrus Glow and enjoy the Frankincense scent too. Unfortunately, they don’t last long, and Real Love wasn’t for me. For $24.99, I expected more longevity and a better variety of scents.
498. I purchased these for my kids, and they absolutely loved them! The spikes on the balls give a great sensory feeling, and the balls are light and bouncy. I also kept a set for myself to use at work when I need a stress reliever. The quality is excellent, and the smell faded after a week, so no complaints there. Highly recommend!
499. I should have checked the ingredients before drinking this tea. It has little taste, and unfortunately, I'm allergic to oranges, which led to a bad reaction. Lesson learned to always check the ingredients first.
500. Ordered it and had it delivered in just 18 hours, but the rubber inside caused my arm to sweat, making the strap slip off. I found it uncomfortable, and the velcro rubbed against my upper arm. Sadly, I’ll be returning it.
501. This product helps distribute weight and relieve pressure from my sciatica. Plus, the cover is a nice bonus!
502. Arrived on time and works great for cleaning off oil and grime from your hands. It’s more affordable and effective than other brands. Perfect for shop use!
503. I absolutely love my Aria. Setup was easy, and it works beautifully.
504. Great product—nothing to complain about here!
505. I bought these to clean the interior of my car, and I was shocked at how much dirt and grime I had been missing! They worked incredibly well on my door panels and center console.
506. This gift box is absolutely gorgeous with its diamond-like etchings and sturdy build. It unfolds in seconds and makes a beautiful gift box, perfect for lingerie or small items. However, the ribbon came damaged, which was disappointing. Otherwise, it’s an elegant and durable box at a reasonable price.
507. This is a great file, way better than most others I’ve tried.
508. Used this for foot stability, and it did the job just fine.
509. I love this product! It’s gentle yet effective for cleaning.
510. It's not heavy and works great. Excellent price for the quality!
511. This brace is comfortable and fits well in my shoes. It stabilizes my ankle and helps lift my toe, preventing falls. I’ve ordered three so far, and it’s the best one. After an issue with the strap, the company provided excellent customer service and sent a replacement. Five stars for that!
512. These napkins were absolutely lovely—perfect for my needs.
513. This product has been a lifesaver for my dad. No more spills, and he no longer risks falling in the middle of the night.
514. Very high-quality light—makes a huge difference for sewing. I’ll definitely be ordering more for my other machines.
515. Excellent replacement heads at a great price. I’m very satisfied with my purchase.
516. Sure, you can buy peroxide for less, but this pre-mixed 3% solution with a nice scent is so much more convenient. It saves time and effort, and it works well as a disinfectant.
517. I take these natural sleep pills when my Ambien doesn't work, and they help me fall asleep in 15-30 minutes. I also sleep more soundly through the night. They're a great supplement for better rest, and the ingredients include calming herbs like lemon balm and passionflower. 
518. I love this! I used to use a tennis ball, but this is much easier to handle. I’d pay a little more for slightly better quality, but it still works great.
519. I applied this product to my sofa, but it ran out halfway through, and I didn’t realize how much product I was using. It doesn’t make the upholstery completely waterproof, but it does help with spills by preventing them from soaking in right away. I wouldn’t rely on it as a long-term solution but more of a temporary fix.
520. This trimmer is solid and cool-looking. It comes with three clip-on blade adjustments, a rechargeable battery, and a strong cutting ability. It’s perfect for trimming sideburns, beards, and even creating designs in your hair. A great gift for anyone who needs a grooming tool!
521. These heads are from a generic brand, likely imported from another country. They’re softer than what I expected, and I'm uncertain about their durability. They fit my Clarisonic Mia without any issues, but I probably won’t be purchasing them again.
522. It works, but I wouldn’t buy it again.
523. First, these bars contain soy, which I can’t touch due to an allergy. The others in my hiking group tried them instead. Unfortunately, all three of us hated the chocolate crisp cereal bars. They smelled okay but had a bitter aftertaste and a chemical sweetness. We couldn’t finish them, so I can’t pass the remaining bars along.
524. Coverage is good.
525. I really enjoy this organic kale powder! It has a subtle taste that blends nicely into my protein shakes. I add it every morning with frozen berries or tropical fruit. I also like using a mason jar to avoid mess.
526. This works great for curling short hair.
527. I first found this at my local gym/spa and love it. However, it’s quite expensive for just coconut extract. If anyone knows of something similar at a lower price, I’d love to try it.
528. I take liquid vitamins regularly, but this product made me incredibly ill. I followed the instructions and took it with meals, but after each dose, I became sweaty and vomited. After several attempts, I stopped trying. Does Youngevity have a money-back guarantee?
529. Can I give this zero stars? These bars were completely inedible, with a vile taste. Normally, I’d offer things like this to local wildlife, but I couldn't bear to subject them to these. I had to throw them away.
530. I like this product, but one thing to note is that cleaning your face thoroughly is important. I broke out after using this, but it wasn't the product’s fault—it was because I spread bacteria around my face.
531. This functions well, is well-made, and comes at a great price. Plus, you get two sets, which makes it a good deal.
532. These gloves are perfect for dishwashing, keeping your hands dry from dirty water. They're durable, comfortable, and look great. The pack contains two regular gloves and two with a soft fuzzy lining.
533. These didn't stick at all—they just slid down inside my shoes.
534. When working from home, a comfortable chair is essential, and this product helps a lot with support and comfort.
535. I love the light, clean scent of this cleaner.
536. It’s a bit pricey, but it’s a fun way to track your weight progress. However, I’m bummed because it’s not recommended to use while pregnant. Other than that, it looks nice and works well alongside my Fitbit.
537. This foot file is a game-changer! It works so much better than others I’ve used.
538. Great quality product.
539. This keeps my home smelling amazing and lasts a long time.
540. These adhesives work really well and stay in place. I’ll definitely buy them again.
541. Not ideal for thick hair—takes too long when doing small sections! But the curls come out great if you have the time.
542. This holds both of my EpiPens securely and feels sturdy. I added a carabiner to clip it to my backpack, and the color makes it easy to spot. It’s lasted for years with minimal wear, and I’m happy with it.
543. It works well and is a great value for the price.
544. Taking Trim Probiotic for Women has definitely made me feel better overall. I’ve been taking probiotics for a while, and this one has helped reduce bloating. While it hasn’t made me any trimmer, I do think it’s effective.
545. I added artichoke to my supplement routine to help with lowering cholesterol and soothing a sensitive digestive system. It’s generally well-tolerated, and I’ve seen improvement with my GERD symptoms. Fingers crossed for my next blood test!
546. Pretty good.
547. This probiotic strain is great for managing autoimmune inflammatory issues. It’s been very helpful for me, and I’m very happy with the results.
548. I found this incredibly uncomfortable and ended up returning it.
549. I was hoping for pure copper, but the package says these are stainless steel.
550. I don’t understand why this product was created when soap and water work just as well. I used it to clean a paint-stained brush, and it didn’t do much. I went back to my usual method of soap and hot water for a better result.
551. I've been using Benzodent for years to relieve sore gums while wearing dentures, and it does the job every time.
552. I was choosing between these and the Etymotic Research ER20-SMC earplugs for concerts. They both perform similarly, but I find the DownBeats to be more comfortable, especially when lying down. My friend prefers the Etys due to concerns about the short length of the DownBeats.
553. Great flavor and a decent boost. Definitely planning to buy it again.
554. This smells like watermelon, and it's absolutely delightful! A little goes a long way because the scent is quite strong, but it smells fantastic.
555. These don’t fizz at all, and the scent isn’t great either.
556. I thought this mini dustpan would be smaller, but it’s still quite handy. The brush has two sides: one for sweeping and the other as a squeegee, which makes it versatile. I’ve even used it to clean my squirrel’s cage, which is much faster than before. It’s easy to clean with soap and water.
557. This is easy to use, and while my first attempt with a watermelon didn’t produce perfect slices, it was much easier than using a knife. The rubber grip is handy when your hands are sticky from juice, and it feels solid. The melon baller works better on firmer fruits like cantaloupe.
558. I bought these for my 92-year-old dad, and they’re great for keeping his feet warm while walking around his tiled room. They allow him to move around without needing slippers, and I’ve purchased over a dozen pairs for him over the years.
559. I like this product, though I had to figure out the settings through trial and error. The instructions could be clearer, especially since I ended up ordering face masks online after learning what they were in Japan. It’s a good, affordable option.
560. These bulbs are bright and daylight balanced, which helped lower my utility bill. However, they break easily. I've had multiple packs with bulbs that have exposed wires and detached bases.
561. I ordered these clear bottles, not realizing they didn’t have screw-on caps. The lid is the cap and has a rubber seal that prevents leaks. I appreciate not having to deal with separate parts when drying them in my bathroom.
562. Very firm and smooth—great quality. I use it for balance exercises, and it’s perfect for strengthening my leg muscles.
563. This has helped my husband with his stomach issues.
564. This lash curler has teeth along the silicone pads, which really help separate lashes after mascara. It gives a more natural look and is very affordable. It comes with multiple replacements, which is a great bonus.
565. I love this combination of kelp and potassium. I was feeling tired all the time, but after just two days of use, I noticed an increase in my energy levels. It’s excellent for replenishing iodine if you use non-iodized salt.
566. A little pricey, but it lets me honor the "Queen of Bengazi" every day, which is something special!
567. The downside is that they wear out in just a week or so.
568. I’ve been using magnesium for years to help with leg cramps, and this formula is the best I’ve found.
569. Elevated toilets are hard to find and expensive, but this innovative product solved my problem without being noticeable. My handyman installed it in about 30 minutes, and it’s been a big help, especially with my aching hips.
570. A friend recommended this product for bruises, and it works! I sprayed it on the bruised area for three consecutive nights, and the bruising was completely gone. Normally, my bruises take over two weeks to heal. I’m thrilled with the results and highly recommend it!
571. While this product will cover both the upper and lower dentures, the container isn't leak-proof. It's great for use at home but not ideal for storing dentures while traveling unless they remain stationary.
572. This product doesn’t contain any vitamins at all! I must have read somewhere that it’s the best value, but I wouldn't recommend it for vitamin content.
573. I had rust stains on my countertop from my metal paper towel holder, but after using The Pink Stuff, the stains disappeared in just 5 minutes. It's amazing! I wish I'd taken a before picture to show just how well it worked.
574. Unfortunately, this didn’t do much. It kept the surface a little cleaner but didn’t make much of a difference, and it actually made the surface feel harsher after a few uses.
575. Unfortunately, this didn’t fit my eyelash curler. I didn’t realize that not all curlers use the same size.
576. These pads work well in my Sally Hansen curler. The texture isn’t as nice as the original, but I got a whole bunch of them for less than the cost of the curler itself, so it’s a good deal. They come in fun colors like pink, blue, and green.
577. These are fantastic for relieving muscle tension in the neck, back, arms, and legs. Definitely a helpful product!
578. I don’t recommend this heating pad. It emitted very high EMFs and even made me feel nauseous. The smell of burning wires was too strong for me. I don’t think this would provide any real health benefits, and the negative effects outweigh any positives.
579. These worked as expected. I have no complaints. The instructions suggest sterilizing before use, and they lasted the usual amount of time before needing replacement. I’ll buy these again.
580. I love this long-wearing lip color! It’s a nice, medium pink-mauve that works perfectly with my fair, pink skin. It’s hard to find cool-toned shades that aren’t too bright or peachy, but this one is just right. If I want a deeper shade, I mix it with another color.
581. These tubes are nearly perfect! I’ve been using them for touch-ups during painting projects. They’re so convenient, but two of the applicator tips fell off after a while. It’s not a huge issue since I plan to just use foam brushes from now on, but I’ll buy another set regardless.
582. This chair is fine for watching TV, but it's not great for extended use. It’s easy to assemble but not worth the price for comfort over long periods.
583. These are not only nice-looking, but they’re also of very good quality.
584. After using a few different neck traction pillows over the past eight months, I’ve found this one to be quite similar to others, though it has a more comfortable cushion in the center. It provides good relief for neck and back pain, and it’s definitely worth trying if you prefer an alternative to medication.
585. I'm from Philly, so naturally, I had a bit of fun with my husband about these Dallas Cowboys bags. They worked great for storing fruit, and the zippered closure is strong. They didn’t leak or stretch, and the star design is a fun touch for any Dallas fan.
586. This is great stuff! My hair, nails, and overall health have improved since I started using it. It dissolves well in beverages, though it takes a bit longer in cold liquids. I’ve even sprinkled it on my pets’ food! Highly recommend.
587. These are fantastic for reading and watching TV while lying flat. They're sturdy, comfortable, and make a great, practical gift.
588. I bought this to clean the bottom of my pool, and it works great!
589. This is a great nail dryer. It works as expected and makes drying my nails much quicker.
590. This diaper is very soft and made from 100% cotton. The velcro holds up through washing, but it does leak after the baby pees once. It's best for short, diaper-free time or very light use.
591. I grew up using hot water bottles for stomach and back aches, and this one is just like the ones I’ve always used. It’s easy to fill and comes with a cover to protect from the heat. It's a comforting option when you’re feeling unwell.
592. This works great for warming a bed-ridden person, and you can microwave it. It’s thick, cushioned, and comfortable.
593. These balloons are fun and pretty, but calling it a "kit" is misleading. The balloons are included, but there’s no string or sticks, so I had to buy those separately.
594. This curler works well, but it requires a bit of extra time for setup and cleanup. While it’s a bit of a hassle to use, the results are great when you have the time to go all out.
595. My wife and daughter both use and enjoy this product. What else can you ask for?
596. This bath seat is perfect for using in the bathtub with an infant. It's easy to store and much more compact than a traditional baby bath. My only complaint is that it absorbs water and takes over 24 hours to dry.
597. These are nice, but I feel like they’re a bit overpriced.
598. While convenient, it’s much cheaper to make this yourself. You can easily mix your own version with common ingredients like salt, magnesium, and lime powder. It’s simple and cost-effective.
599. Perfect! I bought this for my daughter’s dorm room, and she loves it!
600. As a nurse and microbiology enthusiast, I love that these probiotics are complete and easy for my kids to take. They’re chewable and taste good, and my kids actually look forward to them every night. I highly recommend them and will keep buying them.
601. Very easy to use.  
602. None of the items were bent, and they're still hanging strong. I can definitely reuse them.  
603. Fantastic product! My family and I noticed a significant reduction in gas and bloating just a couple of days after starting the prebiotic.  
604. I'm surprised this product is still available, though it’s no surprise it’s from England. Sometimes, I prefer clearing my nasal passages without relying on drying medications. This product provides temporary relief.  
605. I had trouble figuring out which filter to order. The one I received didn’t match the one I took out, but it did fit and it’s a 10-stage filter. I really dislike changing filters, though, and the company needs to design an easier-to-change model.  
606. Great product, good price, and fast delivery.  
607. My wife made me get it.  
608. While pumpkin seed oil is usually linked with men’s health, it’s great for both genders. It supports bladder and urinary health, heart health, reduces inflammation, and even helps with insomnia and depression. These capsules from Nature’s Bounty are large but easy to swallow with no unpleasant side effects. They’ve even helped ease my mother’s severe arthritis pain and stiffness. I use them as a preventative and am happy with the results.  
609. These are excellent glasses to keep around the house since almost anyone can use them. The 1.50 magnification is helpful but not too strong. They come in fun, colorful frames and protective cases. They’re lightweight and comfy, though they’re not the best for head movement since the focal point changes with your angle. Great for emergencies or reading small print.  
610. My wife loves this product. It's well-built and affordable, perfect for travel and daily use.  
611. Very nice product, works great, sturdy construction, and a fantastic price. I would recommend this foot spa to anyone.  
612. This Horsetail extract is potent. I didn’t realize it would boost my energy, but it also helped relieve joint and muscle pain within the hour. I take it with other natural anti-inflammatory powders. The silica content also helps promote strong bones. Just be cautious with the dosage as it’s quite powerful.  
613. I love these! After using cheap readers for years, I needed something more reliable. These fit the bill perfectly. Clear vision in both regular and reader lenses, and they look stylish—my grandkids even say so!  
614. These earring hooks are super comfy, sleek, and sophisticated compared to others. Plus, they come with essential wire colors. Highly recommend!  
615. It’s really convenient to have the week prepared or to grab a specific day. The outer case ensures the meds stay in place while packed.  
616. This is a bit overpriced.  
617. For the price, these work well.  
618. This product is a great addition to accommodate a bedside commode.  
619. These are incredibly convenient and work excellently!  
620. Seems to be a good quality IP6 supplement.  
621. After just four days of use, I’ve already noticed improvement in the pain in my thigh.  
622. I started using this supplement a couple of weeks ago for my arthritis and tendonitis. Unfortunately, it caused severe heartburn, which persisted despite trying to manage it with Pepcid. I won’t buy again and wouldn't recommend it.  
623. Duplicate, needed in two rooms, no more fighting over stars! Great deal.  
624. I received two different sizes of pill organizers instead of the two large ones I ordered. It’s a bit annoying, but these GSK organizers are still better than the cheap versions from CVS. They are more durable, though the CVS ones open faster. These organizers are great for traveling.  
625. I ordered this cushion after trying one at a friend’s house. It’s not as high as my old cushion, but it’s definitely comfortable and of good quality. The only downside is the strange smell that hasn’t gone away yet. Overall, a good product though I wish it came in a thicker option.  
626. This brush is two-sided. While I like the soft bristles on the back, the head could be larger with more bristles. The short handle and annoying rope loop also make it less convenient. I don’t think it’s worth the $14.99 price tag.  
627. I love this rope! It's much softer than most ropes, which makes it comfortable and easy to tie knots. It's 32 feet long, so you might need more if you're planning on using it for extended sessions. The rope is durable, but the ends can fray, so you might want to burn them to prevent that. The red color is also a nice touch.  
628. Not three-ply, but two-ply. It’s usable in emergencies, but the texture is rough, and the emoji print isn’t always centered. It’s more of a novelty gift than a practical product.  
629. Best facial tissue ever! I’ve tried many brands, but nothing compares to Puffs Plus With Lotion. Even after washing and drying, these tissues hold up. They never fall apart and are always soft. I’ve subscribed for regular deliveries.  
630. Super great taste and amazing results.  
631. I had this bench in my cart for months, unsure if the quality would be worth the cost. It’s heavy, durable, and easy to assemble. Perfect height for shaving my legs in the shower. It’s exactly what I needed!  
632. The grabber I bought pinched my hand, causing a small cut. For the price, I think it’s what I expected, no more, no less.  
633. I’m 5’2” and weigh 130 pounds, and I absolutely love this cushion! It’s soft but supportive, perfect for sitting comfortably without my legs or butt going numb in my office chair. It’s fun and bouncy and has a nice black zip cover.  
634. This thermometer is incredibly easy to use. It only took me a couple of seconds to get accurate readings from my forehead and ear. It’s digital, which is a big plus, and comes with a velvet storage bag. I love how simple it is to clean with just a wet cloth. I highly recommend it.  
635. Great for icing my knee after ACL surgery. It’s lighter than the Chatanooga, making it easier to use.
636. I really like this product!
637. This kava kava powder dissolves so well compared to others. At a dose of 12 tsp, it’s mild yet calming, creating a nice sense of calm. Great product from a trusted company.
638. Bought this for my neighbor, and she absolutely loves it!
639. These pill boxes are spacious. They’re large enough to hold a week’s worth of medication. The plastic quality is solid, and while the latch isn't fancy, it feels secure.
640. Very effective and efficient!
641. I’ve had this thermometer for 13 months, and luckily, my kids rarely get sick. However, when my daughter had a high fever recently, the thermometer was inconsistent, giving multiple readings within minutes. Even though I tried both ear and forehead readings, the results didn’t match. The customer service was unhelpful since the warranty had expired a month ago. I’m disappointed because I expected a thermometer to last longer, especially at this price.
642. This product is great for preventing diaper rash. The smaller size is perfect for the diaper bag, and I love that it came with 3 instead of just 2. Highly recommend!
643. There’s little to no taste, so I just add the powder to smoothies. It doesn’t change the flavor. The bag is good quality, but I’ve found that fine powders tend to get stuck in the ziplock, so I prefer transferring it to a jar.
644. I’m excited to try this product in a couple of weeks.
645. If you're looking to add apple cider vinegar to your diet, these gummies make it super easy. They taste good and seem effective.
646. There's no solid evidence supporting that cordyceps mycelium has medicinal benefits, as most research focuses on the fruiting body, which is what people usually associate with mushrooms.
647. I’m impressed by how sturdy these are! They’re very comfortable for watching TV lying down, which helps prevent neck pain. I didn’t love using them for reading since I need reading glasses, so wearing two pairs felt awkward. My husband loved them, though, and wants a pair for watching TV.
648. These were fine for LED light therapy, but they didn’t block enough light. They stuck to my eyes, and getting them off wasn’t easy. They might be better for tanning.
649. Dusting furniture has never been easier! The design lets me grip the edges and reach every corner, making dusting super efficient.
650. These 10.5” straws are perfect for larger cups but a little too tall for my usual Starbucks drink. I got a shorter set, which is ideal for me. The carry bag and straw brushes that came with them are a great bonus.
651. This hot/cold therapy pack is awesome! I mainly use it as an ice pack, and it’s so easy to just strap on and relax.
652. I’m allergic to many things, so these softener dryer sheets have been a lifesaver! They don’t irritate my skin at all.
653. The toothbrush feels a bit light and cheap, but it works well. It’s portable and perfect for travel or office use since it's smaller than my regular one. The power and cleaning ability are good.
654. I’ve been using this regularly for camping and the beach. It keeps me smelling fresh and my skin feels great.
655. Saved me from getting seasick! Highly recommend.
656. I use Ziploc bags all the time, and I love that this one features the Seahawks logo. It’s a perfect fit for my Washington home and ideal for gift-giving.
657. This product looks cool, but it’s tricky to open, and the meds tend to spill out sometimes.
658. Thank you!
659. This works well in foods and as a supplement. I’ve used it before, and a little goes a long way.
660. I've had this for a week now. It’s still working, but with cats, it’s hard to tell. I have a love-hate relationship with cats, and one has been ruining my plants. I wanted something more humane than a zapper mat or spray, so I tried this. It has a pleasant scent and doesn’t smell like chemicals. After a few nights of spraying, my plants have remained untouched, but I’m still not sure if it’s the spray or the cat just hasn’t returned.
661. These look better for men than women.
662. These aren’t 100% effective, but they’re more durable and convenient than homemade options. They don’t last forever, but they’re still a good investment for the price.
663. I've struggled with insomnia for over 20 years. On vacation, even in the quietest rooms, it’s hard to sleep. During a recent trip to Atlantic City, I used a silk sleep mask and earplugs, and they made a huge difference! The mask blocked out the light, and the earplugs muted my husband’s snoring, helping me get some much-needed rest. They’re comfortable, and I’m so glad I had them.
664. This is very comforting, though I wasn’t into the music feature. It arrived charged, so I could use it right away, but it does have an older USB port.
665. This works well on most surfaces!
666. After trying several facial scrubs, I’m disappointed with this one. Unlike my favorite scrub, which has plenty of exfoliating particles, this one lacks enough scrubbies to remove dry skin effectively. It doesn’t work for my dry skin, so I won’t buy it again.
667. I’m not sure what Bilberry does exactly, but we take it for eye health and night blindness, especially as we age. Recommended by our eye doctor, it contains Lutein and Zeaxanthin, derived from marigold extracts.
668. Good product, does what it’s supposed to do.
669. I returned this quickly. It smelled toxic, and the cushion was too firm and raised me too high off the seat. Plus, it’s pricey for what it offers.
670. Great for relieving upset stomachs and heartburn.
671. Used these inserts to reduce shoe volume in the toe box. They were easy to mold and fit great afterward. Highly recommend!
672. Impressed with the clear sound quality. It exceeded my expectations, with a variety of sounds I wasn’t expecting.
673. This pad improved our old massage table, though I wish it were thicker. It’s a good value, fits larger tables, and we’ve only tried the cool side so far.
674. Works as expected, just make sure to align the battery properly with the charger for correct charging.
675. I've used an Emjoi micro unit for years and wanted to try this one. It’s quick, efficient, and does exactly as described. One of my best purchases!
676. Disappointed with this product. It's too hard and uncomfortable, especially as a neck roll. Not for me.
677. These last about an hour of continuous use, and they’re quite small, but they’re overpriced for a Chinese product.
678. We tried this to keep feral cats out of our yard, but it didn’t work as advertised. We followed the instructions and applied extra, but the cats still used our yard as a bathroom.
679. Good price for a natural supplement. Fast shipping too!
680. The fish oil is well-packaged, clear, and the capsules taste great when they melt in your mouth.
681. Love it! Arrived on time and works great with no complaints.
682. These herb combo pads arrived quickly and as described. They work well for moxibustion treatment if you know how to use them, and they come with helpful paper shields. Good value.
683. These tissues are disappointing. They're thin, not very soft, and not worth the price. Stick with Kleenex or store brands for better quality.
684. Bought this for a friend. It works well. Consider looking for a shirt with drain holder pockets for easier use.
685. Perfect for larger pills! A great product.
686. Bought this for my nephew who’s dealing with depression and medical issues. He loved it, especially the black tourmaline, which helps cleanse negative energy and promote healing.
687. I use this for fibromyalgia pain relief. It works well with a small amount, and the strong smell fades quickly. Just remember to wash your hands afterward.
688. The roller part fell off the stainless steel roller immediately. Not impressed with the quality, and I prefer natural jade or rose quartz rollers.
689. Works as advertised. I’ve been using it for six months with great results.
690. Bought this for my daughter, and it has helped her greatly. A great buy.
691. No complaints. Love the toothpaste.
692. I have foot pain, and these inserts help prevent it. They replace the need for a golf ball massage.
693. Sprayed this on my biking backpack. It applied well, and though my family noticed the smell, it was barely noticeable to me. Haven’t used it yet, but will update if it doesn’t work.
694. These are sharp and uncomfortable.
695. This fish oil has been a game changer for my son with autism. It improved his sleep, digestion, speech, and behavior. The flavor is pleasant and not fishy, and I mix it with yogurt. We’re loyal customers now!
696. The GOOAD Dog Clippers work well and are surprisingly quiet. Great for skittish dogs, and the extra attachments make it a great value.
697. The whitening kit lightened my teeth, but it didn’t deliver miraculous results. The instructions are unclear, and the process can be uncomfortable. It’s an okay product.
698. Exactly what I wanted—just right!
699. Anything with Gerry gets five stars! It arrived on time and in great condition.
700. I’ve been using this glyconutrient supplement to support my immune system and blood sugar. It seems to be working, as my blood sugar is more stable and I haven’t gotten sick. It’s like “elephant repellant”—you don’t see the results, but it works!
701. I use this with my 6-month-old baby for the nebulizer, and it works wonderfully.
702. The product seems well-built, and I have the version with extra padding. However, the massage strength is too weak for my liking—it's even less powerful than handheld devices. Even at the highest setting, it didn’t feel effective, and the heat function didn’t work for me either. I wouldn’t recommend using it while seated, and it takes up quite a bit of space, so you’d have to move it around if there are others sitting nearby.
703. The quality is poor—it's made of cheap plastic! The head doesn’t move, only the handle does. Not worth the price!
704. I returned this for a smaller half roll. It just wasn’t the right fit.
705. One of the best flavors in the Balance bar range. Super tasty—almost like a candy bar! I almost regret finding these because they’re so delicious.
706. Great product, works well and is easy to use. Highly recommend!
707. I was impressed by its performance, but ultimately decided to buy something else instead. No big deal.
708. It fits better than cheaper alternatives, but it’s a bit pricey since this model has been discontinued.
709. The pump didn’t come with my package, which didn’t bother me since I have other ways to inflate it. However, for someone who doesn’t have that ability, this could be a major inconvenience. This product works well if you can inflate it yourself, but if you can't, I wouldn’t recommend it.
710. I placed one in my small office and another in my living room to help with cigarette and pet odors. After two months, I haven’t noticed any improvement in the smell or air quality in either room. Unfortunately, I can’t return them now.
711. Based on the positive reviews, I was hoping this would work better. I have a herniated disc between L5 and S1, and the product is large and quite hard. It ended up hurting my back, so I’ll be donating it to a friend whose father is in a wheelchair.
712. I’ll wait to see if it was worth the investment. The product works, but I’m still deciding about the cost.
713. These socks are fantastic. The fabric is soft, smooth, and feels great on my skin. I love how bright and fun the designs are—much better than the boring tan, black, or white ones I’ve seen before. They’re a great option for compression socks, especially since I struggle with leg swelling. The only downside is that when my calves are really swollen, the design stretches and loses its vibrancy. This doesn't happen with all the pairs I bought, but it’s an issue with some. If you don’t experience swelling or are thinner, this likely won’t be a problem. It would be nice if the company offered different sizes to help with this.
714. This product works well, but don't rush the dosage—it can make you feel worse if you increase too quickly. Start slow and let your body adjust. Use it with ReMyte for best results. I still find it hard to believe the seller's claim that chloride is removed, as it tastes exactly like magnesium chloride.
715. The packaging is exceptionally well done. The box is inside another box, which ensures great protection. The oil inside is light and tasteless, and the glass bottle is beautifully designed. This exceeded my expectations.
716. Absolutely fantastic! I use it every day in the shower, and it provides great relief for dry, itchy skin.
717. Excellent product! It mixes easily with water, making it great for portability. I’ve also added it to fresh strawberries and blackberries for a twist on lemonade. It’s perfect for hot weather, and I’ll definitely keep it in my regular rotation. Highly recommend!
718. This could be a handy travel razor, though I can’t say how well it shaves—I never got it to turn on. I thought the battery might be dead, but after charging it, it still wouldn’t work. The shaver warmed up, and the charge light came on, but that was all. The design is unique, with the rotary heads in a line instead of the usual circular arrangement, but it feels cheap and plastic. If it had worked, the small size and light weight would have made it a good travel option, but since it didn't turn on, I can only give it 1 star.
719. The mounting bracket wouldn’t tighten because the material is too weak. I tried bending it to fit, but it just bent back. I had to drill and tap it to make it work. The hooks for the basket were also too tight, so I had to reshape them to make them functional.
720. I ordered the wrong one, but I can still use it.
721. This is the best product I’ve found—just like the ones in *My Big Fat Greek Wedding*. I always say, "Did you put some glycerin on it?" For pimples, I put it on at night, and by morning, the swelling is down, and it’s ready to pop. I don’t even dilute it with anything.
722. I’m really happy with this! Despite some negative reviews, I decided to try it and it worked great. I’ve used it in a few projects, including as an additive to epoxy glue, and it’s brighter and longer-lasting than many other watch hands I’ve used.
723. This brush didn’t work for my large cat. It’s not flexible enough and too stiff. My cat hated it.
724. This is my third set of Better Sleep earplugs, and I love them. My husband has had his nose broken several times, so his snoring is intense. These earplugs help block out the noise. I don’t take the best care of them—they often get knocked around or mixed with toys by the cats or grandkids—but they’re washable and last for 8-12 months before I replace them. They really work, so they’re a great bargain!
725. I can’t tolerate all peppermint products, but these have a gentle taste that doesn’t irritate my acid reflux or hiatal hernia. They’re perfect for easing upset stomachs or nausea. I’ll definitely keep these in my medicine chest and kitchen. Plus, I love the tin!
726. Not bad overall. I’ve tried better-tasting hydration powders (like Nuun), but this one gets the job done. The salt level is lower than others, but the saltiness stands out more with this brand. It works as expected, and I feel just as good after my runs as with other brands. I would buy again since it’s slightly cheaper and offers good value.
727. I prefer to wash my face infrequently because over-washing makes my skin produce more oil. But when I need to remove makeup or wash during a shower, this wash is perfect. It feels gentle and natural, and I don’t feel like it’s stripping my skin. It’s a healthy and eco-conscious product.
728. My husband loves this and highly recommends it.
729. This is the only sturdy transparent travel case I’ve found.
730. **Update**: After about 6 months of occasional use (around 125 times), the Velcro closure on the band is worn out. The straps keep separating, even with minimal movement. I’m not a big person, so it’s disappointing that the Velcro doesn’t hold up. If you wear this brace daily, you may need to buy replacements. Despite this, the brace works great for improving posture and relieving pain. It’s well-engineered and effective. I’d give it a 4.5-star rating if I could. The only negatives are the lack of instructions and discomfort from the straps. Overall, though, this product has been a game-changer for my posture and pain relief. Highly recommended!
731. The mask is easy to clean and has elastic to secure it to a child’s head. However, it runs small and didn’t fit my 9-year-old’s face. Also, it has a strong chemical smell.
732. So far, this has worked well. I’ve noticed the cats turning away from the area where I sprayed it. The downside is that it needs to be sprayed every other day, but if it continues to work, I’ll be happy.
733. Great product. Would buy again.
734. Fits better than the original on my arm.
735. It’s a bit bulky, but it does the job. 
736. At first, I thought this product was just okay—something worth considering if you’re willing to spend the money. That was until I had a fall—nothing major, just one of those silly accidents. As I approach 60, I was in a lot of pain. That’s when I thought about trying copper calf compression sleeves. My calf had taken the brunt of the fall, but surprisingly, these sleeves worked wonders. Now, I’m a true believer. They’ve helped me so much that I also got elbow and hand compression gloves. This brand has definitely earned my trust.
737. I really liked this product, as did everyone who smelled it. The only downside is that the bottle could be a bit larger, and the shower gel scent didn’t last long.
738. This is one of the best whey isolate protein powders out there, especially for those who are lactose intolerant. The flavors are some of the best I’ve had, and the chocolate flavor? It’s the best chocolate I’ve tasted in protein powder form.
739. This back brace is great! My only issue is that I bought it for my 80-year-old father, and it’s a bit tricky for him to put on by himself. It’s well-made and comfortable, even when tightened a lot. It definitely helps with posture.
740. I like that the days can be separated.
741. It cleans just as they describe.
742. I bought this to help with bruising after surgery. It worked a bit, but I didn’t use it for long—about a week—and I also used ice, so I can’t say for sure how effective it was.
743. Fits fine around my car seat and should work with any bucket seat in a car or truck. I’ll test it further and adjust the review if there are any issues. So far, it seems supportive. I appreciate that there’s no memory foam, so no odor. It was well-packed in a large box, so no issues with the product’s quality. However, the air freshener smell stuck to it, and it didn’t smell like lavender as expected. I ended up returning it.
744. Very disappointed. This didn’t hold liquid; the opening kept popping open. I woke up twice with an empty brush. I wouldn’t recommend it and went back to using an Oxo brush with a screw-on dispenser.
745. The review process on Amazon has changed. Now, when you read reviews for a product, they sometimes aren’t related to the product you're actually looking at.
746. It’s easy to breathe in and quite large. It’s also much easier to talk in and washes well.
747. This is pretty sweet, but the flavor reminds me of an orange Starburst—definitely not something I want in a drink. If you’re okay with artificially sweetened drinks, it might not bother you. I recommend using cold water to drink it; it helps cut down on the sweetness. I took half a scoop, which gives me about 125mg of caffeine, similar to a cup of coffee. I didn’t feel jittery or anxious, just a little more focused during my workout. Overall, I’m not fond of the flavor, but the effects are good, so I’ll continue using it and just drink it quickly.
748. These lens wipes work really well, and we’re very happy with them. Great price for so many.
749. Really good. I use it every day—it’s great for my health.
750. I bought this to add to a smoothie recipe, and it has fantastic flavor. I’m sure it’s packed with nutrients. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who makes smoothies regularly. I blend it with frozen cherries, banana, and orange juice, and it’s spectacular. Will buy again!
751. Solves a common problem! Most people who’ve used an Ace bandage for a while know that you often lose the clips. Dropping one and stepping on it can make it useless. I’ve tried using safety pins, but they don’t hold the bandage evenly. This pack of 50 clips is great! They’re not the most durable, so I replace them every few days, but they’re much better than using safety pins. They also come in handy for wider Ace bandages, which often don’t come with enough clips. I’m glad I bought them!
752. Good product; I buy them all the time.
753. This product shouldn’t be sold here—it’s temperature sensitive and needs to be shipped with an ice pack during warmer months. Who knows how hot it gets in Amazon’s warehouses? I’d recommend buying it from your local practitioner to ensure it hasn’t lost its potency after being exposed to heat. Definitely a waste of money if it’s not stored properly.
754. These are super soft and nice, but after just a few hours, they flattened and became hard. I know they’ll eventually lose some softness, but I expected a little more cushion.
755. There’s nothing like a full mesh body puff for the shower, but these mitts come close. The mesh is thin and sewn onto the glove, and it has two finger holes for the thumb depending on how you wear it. For a sudsy wash, I use the mesh side, and for exfoliating, I turn it over. It also has a loop for hanging. It doesn’t replace my favorite shower sponge, but it’s a solid alternative. Plus, you can use these for dishes if you don’t want to use them for the shower. At $13.98, it’s a little pricey at $6.99 per mitt, but still worth it.
756. I like this product, but it only has one hot temperature. Although it has buttons to adjust the temperature of the brush, they don’t seem to do anything.
757. The pills are fine and easy to take, and I appreciate the quick shipping.
758. My boyfriend needed new clippers, and cordless seemed like the best option. These clippers are amazing, trust me!
759. I was pleasantly surprised by how these pads helped alleviate pain in the balls of my feet when wearing heels. I was skeptical, but now I’m sold. Highly recommend!
760. Very soft and easy to put on. There are a few strands of yarn poking through the front, so I’m unsure how well it will hold up over time.
761. Bought this for my niece, and she loves it!
762. These worked well at first, but they lost their effectiveness after a while. Not as effective as they’re supposed to be.
763. This machine is amazing! It comes with many different attachments and delivers exactly what I was looking for. The price is great, too—other places wanted $150, but this one is much cheaper and includes more. It’s strong and totally worth the buy.
764. Got this for my son for Christmas, and he LOVES it! He works as a welder in a machine shop, so his body takes a beating. He tested it out today and was shocked by how well it worked. He’s had other products before, but nothing has really worked to relax his muscles. This one did! The two heads on this massager, along with its different speeds and attachments, really helped. It’s easy to use, though it’s even better when someone else does it for you, haha.
765. I got these, and while they were a great deal, they have a bit of a strong smell at first, which took some getting used to. They’re somewhat soft but not as soft as I expected from tissue with lotion.
766. These have the strength and feel of high-end plastic cutlery. They’re labeled “Compostable in Industrial Facilities” and say you should “check locally” since many areas don’t offer industrial composting. These are not suitable for backyard composting. However, they’re made from renewable sources, which is a bonus.
767. I spent $150 on a fitted plastic retainer at the dentist and use this at night. It provides amazing whitening with zero gum or tooth pain—unlike Crest white strips, which hurt my gums.
768. Useless. The spring is bigger and coarser than other brands I’ve tried, and it didn’t even epilate. I didn’t feel anything pulling or epilating when I used it. I immediately went back to my older wand from another brand. I threw these away. Thankfully, they weren’t expensive. I’ve learned Bellabe is worth the extra money.
769. Growing up, my mom always tried sneaking healthy ingredients into our food. Spirulina powder is a much more subtle way of doing that. Mixing it into acidic sauces or dressings completely hides the flavor. I add it to spaghetti and lasagna, and no one suspects a thing. It’s a great way to sneak in some iron and protein!
770. It’s hard to go wrong with basic dish gloves. These perform just as well as any other pair I’ve used. The palm has a textured area to improve grip on wet dishes. I’m allergic to latex, and these didn’t cause any rash or itching, so they seem to be truly latex-free.
771. These eyeglass cases are cute and very handy. They fit well in my purse, and the order arrived quickly. I’m happy with my purchase.
772. I love these, but they’re a bit heavy.
773. These masks are super cute and comfortable. The stretchy band could be just a bit larger or even adjustable, but other than that, they’re great! I love that there’s a pocket for the gel pack. I get migraines often, so these are a huge help.
774. Perfect for making cake pops!
775. My rocking Santa is a whimsical addition to my windowsill. I love watching him rock back and forth!
776. The last time I encountered smelling salts was during my childhood when a friend in the neighborhood had a bottle. We all tried it, and I still remember how overpowering it was. These Westside Barbell smelling salts are just as potent. This time, I used a technique I learned in chemistry class—holding the bottle at a distance and wafting the air toward my nose, rather than sticking my face right over it. They’re powerful and effective smelling salts!
777. On the first day, I had a headache and my jaws were clenched. I waited a few days before trying again, taking just 12% of a capsule, and stayed on that dose for a week with no side effects. After a week, I moved up to a full capsule, and I’ve been amazed by the results. My energy, focus, motivation, and memory are all back to what they were in my 20s! I’m 67 and had started to feel like my mind wasn’t as sharp, but Optimind has brought me back to life. It’s well worth the cost, especially when you order in bulk. Even my husband, who usually dismisses my supplements, now takes one every day. With Optimind, I feel so much more productive—things that used to seem overwhelming, like cleaning the garage or shopping, are now manageable.
778. Arrived on time, and the strength equipment is comparable to others of similar strength. The narrow, rimless lenses are perfect for both reading and watching TV simultaneously.
779. Finally found readers that don’t look like readers! I had been searching for this specific design for over a year. The packaging is beautiful—a zippered glass case with a wipe cloth. The glasses are exactly as shown in the picture, and I’m so happy with them that I’m considering ordering a backup pair.
780. I only used this for less than two months before it stopped working! Really disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it.
781. Bought the two-pack—one for my 94-year-old grandma and the other for my nephews. I’ve only used it with my grandma so far, but I know my nephews will enjoy it too. It’s a fun throwback to when I had one as a kid. Just be aware that the size is quite small.
782. The aroma is lovely, though it has a slightly cologne-like quality. It’s quite strong, but I got used to it after a day. I’ve received many compliments from people who’ve entered my car.
783. These are a great solution for handling life's little inconveniences. They’re comfortable and discreet, and I’d recommend them to others.
784. We've been using the Germ Guardian GG1000 Pluggable Small Air Purifier since 2016, and it still works great. We use it in the bathroom and have never had an issue with it.
785. Some of these fit well and are a neat concept, but they come in various sizes and shapes. I would prefer something more form-fitting for device use. The finger lengths are inconsistent, and a stretchy fabric, maybe a cotton blend, would improve the fit.
786. This is a fantastic hair styling tool! My hair is usually difficult to curl or wave, but this tool keeps my style intact for at least two days. I highly recommend it. Big thumbs up!
787. I got this inexpensive cone-rolling tool, but I found it quite difficult to use. It’s hard to fill after wrapping the paper around it, and I end up rolling cones by hand much quicker.
788. This seemed to really help with my adrenal fatigue. I’ve been feeling better and more energized since using it.
789. The boxes are small but cute, and the color really pops. They were well-packaged, so none of them came bent.
790. It’s just as good as any drugstore hot water bottle—no better, no worse.
791. Unfortunately, my bottle arrived broken, so I couldn’t use it properly. I did manage to dab some of it onto a rough stone floor in my home, and it seemed promising for cleaning. I might consider buying another bottle, though I’m hesitant due to the previous shipping issue.
792. I tried the Vanilla flavor, but it was awful—it didn’t even taste like vanilla. Definitely not my favorite.
793. The containers were only half-filled, and the product wasn’t smooth, but it worked on the itchy flea bites I had.
794. These boxes are perfect for gifting baked goods. They’re sturdy, beautifully colored, and look even better in person. The thank-you cards are high-quality, with matching envelopes, and everything is packaged neatly. This set is ideal for any occasion, from birthdays to weddings, and at a great price.
795. The case is decent, holds my MLG Gunnars well, and is made of nice leather. The only downside is that it’s a bit flimsy when opening, but the magnets keep it closed securely.
796. Neem oil is amazing for hair and skin. It strengthens hair, promotes growth, and fights wrinkles. The capsules are filled with oil, and you can puncture them easily to add to your hair or skin products. They’re also great for mixing into a clay mask to slow drying time. A great buy!
797. These were awful! I tried to give them away, but no one liked them. They ended up being a joke food that we tricked people into eating.
798. For the price, this is an excellent cuticle nipper. The edge is sharp and precise—comparable to a $20 nipper at a much better price.
799. These paper towels are great—they’re thicker, more absorbent, and easy to tear. They don’t tear easily, which is a huge plus. I’m really impressed by their quality.
800. I love camu camu for an extra vitamin C boost. I sprinkle it lightly into shakes, as it’s so potent that it can have a laxative effect. Start small! It’s a great organic product.
801. This product did a much better job removing stains from clothes than other brands I've tried.
802. Be cautious with these earplugs! They’re small and made of silicone, which caused one to get stuck in my ear. There's no stem or handle like with other earplugs, so it’s harder to get them out. If I hadn’t had help from my RN friend, I might have needed to go to urgent care. If you care about your hearing, go for earplugs that have a stem or handle for easier removal.
803. Maca is well-known for its health benefits, and this version from Peru takes it to the next level. Packed with amino acids, it’s excellent for boosting immunity and healing. It’s tasteless, so I add a teaspoon to my smoothies along with Maca and a plant-based protein powder to keep me going while I recover from dental surgery.
804. I was excited to get this for my husband, but unfortunately, the power button doesn’t work. It only turns on if I press the speed button, but then I can’t adjust the speed, and the massager turns off when pressure is applied. Really disappointing.
805. These nail files are thick and durable – a great addition to my nail care routine.
806. I have a question about this product: why does the label say 50% knotweed but the original label reads 20%? Which is correct?
807. My husband absolutely loves this cozy item! It’s a must-have that we should have gotten much earlier.
808. I tried this Spotlight toothpaste because it’s vegan and claims to rebuild enamel. After discussing it with my dentist, I’m skeptical. She recommends Sensodyne for stronger enamel protection. While this toothpaste feels mild, I don’t feel the same clean sensation I get from my usual products, and there’s no foaming action either.
809. These scratch-off cards were a hit at our bridal shower! They were easy to put together and great quality. Everyone had a lot of fun with them.
810. I love adding this to my smoothies – it works perfectly for an extra boost.
811. We replaced our old sound machine with this one, and it’s perfect. It creates a nice white noise that’s great for sleeping.
812. These are cute, but unfortunately, the scent didn’t last longer than a day. I’ll use them up, but I’m not sure I’d buy more.
813. This product is great! The taste took a bit of getting used to, but I mix it with 100% grape juice, and it tastes delicious. I’m 73 years old and feel fantastic after using it – I have so much energy, and I’m able to outpace my husband and kids! I’ll continue taking All Day Energy Greens as long as I can afford it.
814. These small nail buffers are perfect for all kinds of projects and hobbies, not just nails! They’re similar to larger sanding blocks but offer more precision. They’re pretty abrasive, though, with 60-grit on one side and 100 on the other. Not for fine sanding, but still a great deal.
815. This is hands down the best spray wax I’ve used. Other products just don’t last like this one does. After properly clay barring my vehicle, this lasted over six months. It works great on wheels too.
816. This water flavoring is so concentrated that only 12 drops are needed for 8-10 ounces of water. It’s pure and tastes amazing – my favorite flavors are coconut and pineapple-coconut.
817. This product took a while to arrive since it came from overseas, but it’s been a game-changer for my trigger finger. After just a few uses, I felt significant improvement. It saved me from having to undergo surgery. Now, I use it whenever I feel my finger starting to catch. Highly recommend it.
818. These bleach tablets have been a lifesaver for my asthma. I can’t handle the bleach fumes, but these tablets are easy to use and effective without any harsh chemicals. They’re a bit pricey, but well worth it.
819. My carpet is over 13 years old and had seen better days. After trying many carpet refreshers, I thought I’d give this one a shot, but I was disappointed. The package was difficult to open, and the product spilled out. The scent was overpowering and not pleasant – it smelled like tuna and peppermint! I won’t be buying this again.
820. When Bill G. publicly mentioned a smallpox outbreak in late 2021, this old remedy suddenly became popular. Coincidence? Who knows. It’s made in India, and some believe it could be a helpful product in times of health crises.
821. The remote worked great – no issues.
822. I love this Bento box because it’s easy to clean. I can swap out the trays and put one in the dishwasher, making it perfect for quick, daily lunch prep.
823. Simple and effective – this product works as expected.
824. These are great! They work just as they should and are reliable.
825. Pros: Organic, non-GMO, no fillers, vibrant green color, perfect for breastfeeding moms, neutral flavor, works well in juice. Cons: Can upset your stomach on an empty stomach, bag doesn't reseal, small bag size.
826. This knife is sharp and cuts cleanly. It’s a great tool to have in the kitchen.
827. These masks are comfortable and work well for filtering. They fit my large head well and offer good breathability, with minimal fogging on my glasses. I like the black color better than other options and haven’t had any issues with them.
828. This tool works well for removing water from shower walls. I use it after every shower to keep things dry.
829. These lip balms are great! The unflavored ones are neutral with no taste, and they keep my lips moisturized and smooth. I’ll definitely buy these again.
830. This contour pillow is perfect for neck support and helps me feel more active in the morning. However, it has a strong chemical smell that takes a while to dissipate, so be sure to air it out for a couple of days before using.
831. This product didn’t meet my expectations. The lining is too thin for me, so it doesn’t offer enough protection.
832. I love this small dustpan and brush set. It’s perfect for cleaning up crumbs and eraser bits at my desk or dining room table, and it fits neatly in a drawer.
833. I wasn’t impressed with this. It didn’t remove food well and didn’t scrub as effectively as I’d hoped.
834. This organic Barley Grass is the best I’ve found. It’s fresh, detoxing, and works great in smoothies. I love adding it with dulse flakes, banana, blueberries, and orange juice. It’s delicious and healthy.
835. This party pack was a fantastic value. It worked great for our event, and I’d definitely order again next year.
836. This gel is fantastic. I ended up with a severe sunburn on my back while at an outdoor event. I didn't realize how intense the sun was, and the burn was one of the worst I’ve had. This gel brought immediate relief. The aloe soothes, and the menthol cools. The scent is strong and minty, almost like a very intense mouthwash. I would prefer it to be lighter or unscented, but it works wonderfully for pain relief and promoting healing. Highly recommend.
837. Comfortable and easy to maintain.
838. They work well, but my ear canals are very sensitive to pressure, so they’re uncomfortable to wear while sleeping, which is why I bought them.
839. My cousin recommended these when my wife was taking Miralax. After using them for two weeks, she stopped using Miralax, and the results have been great! She had to cut down the dosage because it worked so well. She doesn’t love the taste, but it’s all-natural. If you're dealing with bathroom issues, this might be worth trying.
840. Perfect for the jewelry lover who enjoys traveling.
841. Leaves a pattern on the food and tears too easily.
842. This oil smells like perfume, not like an essential oil. Vanilla essential oil doesn’t exist, and this is a fragrance blend. It's not organic, and it doesn’t smell like real vanilla—just like cheap perfume. It’s not suitable for diffusers. I would not recommend it.
843. A bit pricey, but very good quality.
844. This product does a great job of keeping my toilets clean. My only issue is the bromine-like smell, which reminds me of a public pool restroom. It's not unpleasant, but noticeable. Still, the convenience is worth it.
845. After a lot of research, I’m so happy with this product. A few years ago, a personal trainer introduced me to foam rolling to work out muscle knots. I hated the large, cumbersome roller I had. Then I found this 3-in-1 roller set, which is compact, sturdy, and effective. It includes a standard roller, a gear-shaped one for targeted pressure, and a massage stick. It works great for relieving muscle tightness and soreness.
846. This product is grainy and doesn’t dissolve, leaving a sand-like residue in the bottom of the cup.
847. Just like the classic product from years ago! Great quality.
848. I would’ve loved these buckets if they were usable. Consider finding a local dealer to avoid this issue.
849. The spray didn’t work well for me. It sprayed more like a stream than a mist.
850. This product works well and has a pleasant aroma. If you follow the instructions, your shoes will be refreshed, as mine were.
851. No complaints, and no noticeable scent.
852. As a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer’s, I was looking for a solution to manage odor caused by incontinence. This product is fantastic! A couple of sprays eliminate odors quickly, and the fragrance disappears, leaving a fresh scent. I highly recommend it.
853. My ferret, Donut, can’t go a day without Ferretone. Every ferret loves it!
854. Great price at $62.
855. I was disappointed when I opened the package and found cute purple sachets that have no scent at all. They’re just decorative, not useful.
856. The effects of this product aren't immediate, but over time, I noticed a fantastic boost. The combination of Cordyceps and Lion’s Mane offers numerous benefits, and I’ve added it to my regular supplement routine.
857. These work great, although they can break off in tight spaces and may require some effort to remove from your teeth. But overall, they serve their purpose well.
858. The brush fits perfectly with my Clarisonic, which is why I bought it, but after only three washes, it developed a strong odor. Very disappointing considering the price.
859. This case is bigger than I expected. It holds a lot of oils, but some of my larger bottles don’t fit, which reduces the available space. The foam insert might wear down over time from exposure to oils. It would be nice to know if the foam is replaceable, but overall, the case is sturdy, and the handle is a nice feature.
860. Not a bad pillow. Worth trying if you're looking for something new.
861. This balloon is the perfect size! We didn’t have helium, so we just filled it with air. It inflated easily and stayed inflated overnight with no issues. It’s great for kids' birthday parties. I checked with a local store, and they will fill it with helium for a small fee ($1.99, just like if we bought it from the store). It’s a fun balloon!
862. The item was way too large and couldn't be returned. A total disappointment.
863. I was skeptical about this supplement, but after using it for a few weeks, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my cognitive abilities. Cervello combines natural and synthetic ingredients to boost memory, including well-known compounds like ginkgo biloba and Bacopa monnieri. What I appreciate most is the noticeable results without side effects—no jitters or headaches. I feel more focused and retain information better. I highly recommend Cervello for anyone looking to improve their memory in a safe and effective way.
864. This set came with four black lanyards. The loop was too small to fit over my head. Even when I adjusted the pushbutton to the maximum, the loop was still too tight. Also, I couldn't open the clasps to attach the masks, no matter how much I squeezed. This product is completely useless, so I tossed it in the trash.
865. It works!
866. I don’t understand why people were complaining about the setup. I placed the scale on a hard floor, connected it in less than 10 seconds, and was ready to weigh myself. It’s very easy to set up. The sleek, bubble-like design looks futuristic, and it synced perfectly with my Fitbit and MyFitnessPal. The best part? It automatically uploaded my weight without me having to touch a button. I was happy with my purchase, especially since it’s accurate—I checked it against my doctor’s scale, and it matched. The only downside is that I need to keep it hidden from my kids since it’s not for anyone under 10. Unfortunately, after a few uses, the scale started giving inconsistent readings, fluctuating by several pounds within minutes. Despite initially liking it, I’m returning it due to these issues.
867. It’s nice to have different sizes, though it does crumble a pill with a heavy coating. The blade could be a bit stronger.
868. Buy it! It gives you great natural energy!
869. I've been using straight razors for years, so I decided to try a shavette for those times when I don’t have time to strop or touch up the edge on my regular razor. I bought two to compare, both "push-type" models. This one is made of coated metal, making it heavier than my usual straight razors. The blade sits perfectly in the holder, and the heavier metal keeps it securely in place. The other shavette I bought had a thin blade holder, causing the blade to sit unevenly. Overall, the matte slide-out shavette is a higher-quality product and great fun to use.
870. I bought these to wear after taking out my contacts. They’re a little wide for me, and I think they’re designed for larger heads. However, I love the style and the quality seems good. I just wish they were a bit tighter at the temples. There’s no distortion in the lens.
871. This beetroot powder smells like dirt, and the taste is very strong and unpleasant. I’ve tried mixing it with other flavors, but the taste is still overpowering. Despite pushing through and using it, I haven’t noticed any energy boost or other benefits. I won’t buy this again.
872. I tried this product last night and encountered several issues. I have very sensitive skin, and the chin section gave me a rash. No matter what I tried, the mask kept slipping over my mouth. The ear openings didn’t line up with my ears at all. While it did keep my mouth closed, I wasn’t impressed with it overall. It’s a waste of money and is now in the trash.
873. This is a great price for so many packs. I love Dreft! I use it not only for baby clothes but for regular laundry as well. It gets out stains like wine, spaghetti sauce, slime, dirt—basically everything my kids get into.
874. These storage containers are smaller than I expected, but they work perfectly for bringing food to work or school. They’re great for salads, pasta, rice, and small leftovers. The lids fit securely and are easy to put on and remove. They’re dishwasher safe on the top shelf, making cleaning a breeze. You get 30 containers in six sets of five.
875. Great quality!
876. I bought this for my granddaughter, and my daughter gets stopped all the time with people asking where she got it. It fits perfectly and looks adorable on her!
877. I really wanted to love this product, but it didn’t work that well for me. I think it might be because I wear makeup, but it didn’t perform as expected. Many people wear makeup, so I’m not sure why it didn’t work for me.
878. Bone marrow is a great source of nutrition that many people miss out on. I didn’t know about its health benefits until recently. I decided to try this supplement, and it’s high-quality. However, I find it difficult to take four capsules a day. I prefer other forms of bone marrow supplements, like the seasoned gravy I can stir into dishes or the chocolate-flavored powder I mix into smoothies. If you’re okay with swallowing pills, this could be a great option.
879. I bought these stickers to label my granddaughter’s books, but I didn’t realize how fancy they were. They’re better suited for invitations or something more formal. Too expensive for just a simple label. My mistake!
880. This product is exactly as described by the seller. The construction is solid, with no protruding nails, and the hinge works well. The essential oil box is perfect for storing my 5-15 ml bottles. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
881. Not as effective as the extra-strength version. I usually go for the extra strength, and after using these, I noticed a clear difference—they just didn’t work as well.
882. This is by far the best bug repellent I've tried. It’s especially great for sensitive skin and has a pleasant smell.
883. The quality was lacking. The items were mismatched in size and thickness.
884. These protein bars are fantastic! They taste great and are perfect for a quick snack.
885. These run a bit smaller than they appear in the ad, but they still work.
886. I encountered a few issues with this product. Initially, the soap wouldn’t come out of the wand, but that was fixed by making the hole larger. Then, even after that, the sponge was too thick for the soap to soak through properly. A small slit in the sponge helped, but the main issue was that the sponge kept popping off the wand. Unfortunately, I had to let it go—too many issues for me.
887. This was exactly what I needed at a great price! I even ordered a second one after receiving the first. The pill cutter and grinder are super easy to use, and the travel case is perfect for keeping extra meds in the car.
888. This product caused a serious reaction. I ended up with a swollen eye and my lashes curled back to my eyelid. The sticky rods tore my skin open, leaving a piece of it stuck to the rod. Removing the rods bruised my eyelids, and my eye swelled up afterward. There are no ingredient listings or any brand to contact for complaints. Definitely not safe for delicate skin.
889. I was very happy with my purchase. I ordered it for a friend, and they absolutely loved the poster. It arrived promptly.
890. The taste is good, and the ingredients are healthy and keto-friendly, except for the Sucralose. I drink Bulletproof coffee regularly, so I'm used to this type. The issue is the cost—it’s $3.50 per cup, which adds up quickly if you drink it multiple times a day. You could make your own at home for a fraction of the price. It’s useful when you’re traveling, but for regular use, it’s a bit too expensive. Also, it's not entirely keto-friendly due to the Sucralose.
891. The product description was unclear. It seems to be of good quality and might be helpful for pregnancy, but it didn’t apply to my situation.
892. This worked wonders for cleaning my BBQ and my two wood stoves, as well as the bricks around them. It was so effective!
893. This product smelled almost rotten, like something had gone bad in it. I couldn’t handle the odor, so I ended up tossing it and trying a different brand.
894. I thought these insoles might be for children because they were so narrow and small. They barely covered my foot, and they were uncomfortable on the sides. Not worth the effort to stick them in my shoes.
895. This pill container is great! I already have one and bought another for a friend. It’s sleek and classy, perfect for packing in a suitcase or purse when traveling.
896. These are perfect for when my arms get cold, but I don’t want to wear a full shirt. They fit great, look nice, and are well made. I highly recommend them!
897. This product is a strong astringent, which works great for tightening gums and improving oral health. I dilute a few drops in water to swish and then dab a little on my deep wrinkles. It’s working wonders! It looks like blood, though, so it might stain, but it really gets the job done.
898. The jar itself is neutral and attractive, but the best part is the match striking surface. It’s surprisingly effective, which is a nice bonus.
899. This is a fantastic remedy for stomach issues. It worked great for my dog as well and helped heal my Bulldog's stomach problems.
900. I really liked using the heart rate monitor—it was the only feature I appreciated. However, the watch itself is bulky, and the app was hard to understand. I switched to a new Fitbit Ultra, but I’ll still keep this one for the heart rate monitoring.
901. Viva Labs Glucosamine is an excellent product with triple strength. I’m thrilled with the price I paid—only $2.99 with free shipping! It’s a great deal, and I definitely recommend trying it for yourself.
902. This scale works great! It was easy to set up and is very accurate. I use it with a Hoyer lift and sling to weigh a wheelchair-bound person, and it’s perfect for that.
903. I absolutely love this product! The size is perfect, and I adore the color.
904. The packaging was discreet, in a padded envelope that made it seem like tools. If it gets hard to blow through, just let it dry off.
905. At first, I didn’t think this gel would work, but it definitely does! I suffer from spinal stenosis, and the changing weather makes it worse. This gel has helped ease my joint pain, and I’m impressed with the large tube—it’s a great value. Highly recommend it for anyone with arthritis, joint pain, or fibromyalgia.
906. I really like this gauze. It’s soft, stretchy, and goes on without a hassle, unlike the standard gauze that falls off while you’re trying to wrap it. And it’s reasonably priced.
907. I should’ve read the reviews more carefully. There were no instructions or ingredients listed, and it seemed like the product had been repackaged manually. My daughter hated the taste, and it stained her lips, teeth, and tongue. I’m now concerned about potential allergic reactions. Not worth the $7.
908. I had a hard time using this because it was crammed into its case and I had to break the case to get it out. I bought it for the case, but the file was fine—just an issue with the case.
909. These gloves are great for protecting your hands from dirt, grime, and water. They’re comfortable, though a little large. The length is perfect for my long fingers, but they’re a bit baggy. Still, they work well for dishwashing and general cleaning. Note that only the teal gloves are flocked, while the pink and white ones are not.
910. Great back support! 
911. I loved these so much that I bought some for my kids and my significant other. I found that one per day is enough. Great product!
912. Definitely don’t drink this straight from the bottle. It burned my throat, and I was sore for three days.
913. After breaking my left fibula, I bought this product to help me put on my shoes, and it’s one of the best purchases I’ve made on Amazon. It’s adjustable, works perfectly, and I’ve since used it for my knee injury as well. I now keep it in a designated spot because it’s so valuable.
914. Do NOT use this for fetch with your dog! It could easily get lodged in their throat if caught the wrong way. My dogs enjoy chewing on it, but one of them chewed off a small piece, which lowered my rating. Any chew toy where a piece can be chewed off isn’t safe.
915. Just as pictured! Great quality.
916. These lanyards are a great solution for hanging masks around my neck. They're ideal for masks with thin elastic due to the small clasps. The cord is long enough and adjustable for a comfortable fit. I love the vibrant colors, and at just $5.99 for multiple lanyards, they’re a steal. My favorite mask chain is a lot more expensive, but this one does the job and adds a fun pop of color!
917. I bought these for my daughter and her family, adding their names to the design. They loved it! My granddaughters wore their hats all day on Christmas, and they looked adorable. These hats are a unique twist on the usual red and white style, and my family liked them so much, they wore them longer than expected.
918. I’ve been adding this to my smoothies, and while I don't love the taste on its own, it blends well with my usual smoothie mix. Unfortunately, I haven't felt much pain relief yet, even with my autoimmune arthritis, but I'll continue using it and update later since these things often take time to work.
919. Great bottles—durable and easy to use.
920. It’s much bigger than I anticipated, but it’s held up well and works great for my needs.
921. I love that these cases store up to 4 batteries each and can be linked together. They help keep my batteries organized, and I think they’re a great buy for anyone who needs to store or transport batteries.
922. I discovered this body wash two years ago when I broke my wrist. It made showering easier with one hand. I loved the green one but couldn’t find it anymore, so I grabbed the orange one on Amazon. It’s just as great and a must-have in my routine.
923. These are sturdy and affordable—great value for the price.
924. I’ve been taking these for a few days, and I noticed I’m not snacking in the afternoon as much. It took about two days to feel the change in appetite, and while the pills are a bit big, they’re easy to swallow if you don't have a strong gag reflex. I’ll check in again after a month to update.
925. I ordered several colors, including black, but all of them were poorly made. The compartments wouldn’t open properly, and I couldn’t even see the pills inside. This was a total letdown, and I had to toss it.
926. These are perfect for kids or smaller adults and very durable for the price.
927. These earplugs have great potential, with several sizing options in both rubber and foam tips. I’m still experimenting to find the best fit for my ears, but I believe most people will find an option that works for them.
928. This TENS unit is amazing! It provides much-needed pain relief and relaxation for my chronic pain. It’s been a game-changer for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking pain relief.
929. These are great, even for adults! They’re fragrance-free and gentle, and I haven’t had any issues with flushing them.
930. These socks are too large for proper compression and don’t fit well around my arches. I’ve tried other brands like SBSox and Roxofit that fit much better. These just didn’t work for me and are going back.
931. The locking mechanism broke after the first use, so now it’s just an expensive plastic bag. Not worth purchasing again.
932. These are very heavy, and I wouldn't wear them out of the house until I’m sure they stay in place.
933. A great price for stylish glasses! They look durable, and the vision is clear. The round shape is perfect for my style.
934. This Cavalier matches the one I have in real life perfectly! It holds my glasses securely and is a cute art piece with a good weight.
935. It arrived quickly, well-packaged, and is a great item for the price.
936. This pillow is a little too low for me when sleeping on my side, but customer service suggested stacking two pillows. I’ll try that to see if it helps.
937. I use this in my bubble bars, and it works wonderfully!
938. The gel is really refreshing, perfect for soothing tired muscles.
939. I ordered these brushes for the charcoal bristles, but they ended up being a mix of white and charcoal bristles. The quality isn’t great as they lose bristles after just a few uses, but I’m keeping them for guests.
940. The smell of this product is a bit off, but it has a smooth, lotion-like consistency, which is much nicer than greasy oils. I recommend it, though you might want to wash your hands afterward or add your own essential oil to mask the scent. Overall, it works quickly and effectively.
941. These containers are great and didn’t leak when filled with my homemade sunblock. However, I deducted a star because the lids don’t screw back down tightly.
942. I didn’t like the taste of this and ended up giving it away.
943. Nice for use on the nose—gentle and effective.
944. I found these in my local grocery store, and they’ve become a favorite. They take a little more time to seal properly, but the results are excellent. I’ve already ordered more from Amazon.
945. I’ve been wanting to try this calcium jelly supplement after seeing it in Kdramas. It’s more expensive than pills, but it’s tastier and has a unique texture, like fruit leather. The pomegranate flavor is subtle and sweet, and I like that it’s free of added sugar and water.
946. Don't hesitate to switch hands if you're having difficulty applying to one eye—it can make things easier.
947. Pros: Contains a good variety of probiotic strains in effective quantities. Cons:  - No enteric coating to protect the probiotics on their way to the colon.  - Not listed on the company's website, though it's promoted on their social media.  - The small company behind this supplement has yet to disclose the name of the manufacturer.  - Ingredients are sourced globally, but the product is bottled in the USA.
948. I wore these to work hoping they’d provide the ankle support I need due to an old tendon tear. While they feel like compression socks (which are better than nothing), they don't offer much in the way of bracing. Even with kinesiology tape, I didn’t feel supported. They’re decent for light compression, but not ideal for real ankle support.
949. Like most superfoods, this powder isn’t particularly tasty on its own, but it mixes well with other foods like tofu. While I appreciate that it’s organic and non-GMO, I don’t feel I gain much from the Noni fruit, since I already eat enough fruits and vegetables. It’s fine, but I wouldn’t repurchase.
950. This product works wonderfully for preventing rashes and redness on my child's skin from diaper undies. I love that it's free from harsh chemicals and petrol-based ingredients. Huge thanks to the Honest Company for this!
951. These flavored drops are great! I used them for vape juice, and my husband loved the taste—no complaints from him.
952. I had high expectations for this product, but I was let down. It required frequent reapplications every 45-60 minutes, which made it impractical. Unfortunately, I won’t be repurchasing.
953. The Hibiclens Hand Pump took forever to arrive, and the straw doesn’t even reach the bottom of the bottle. I ended up purchasing smaller, more affordable pump dispensers that arrived the next day and worked better. Save your money!
954. I really like these. They’re great!
955. The taste is a bit strange, though I enjoy the chocolate and vanilla flavors. The company, however, provided excellent service.
956. These capsules are enormous—almost an inch long and about 1.25 inches in circumference. The “easy to swallow” claim is misleading, as they’re too large, especially for people with small throats or those who struggle with swallowing pills. I won’t buy again.
957. Marine collagen worked much better for me.
958. I opted for this D&K combo because it’s fat-soluble, which helps with absorption. We’ve been using it in our morning coffee for a year now, and it’s kept our Vitamin D levels where they should be. After testing, my levels went from 41 to over 100, which is ideal. No regrets with this product!
959. Fantastic product! I’ve never had anything work faster or more effectively.
960. Very good shisha! My first time trying Fantasia, and I’m loving the rainbow flavor.
961. After trying several nebulizers, this one is by far the best. It’s completely silent, works great, and I love it!
962. These calf compression sleeves are perfect for my running sessions. I’ll definitely buy them again.
963. This dental tool set is great! It comes with six tools, including a mirror, scraping picks, and large tweezers. I’m not a professional, but the scraping tools work really well for keeping my teeth clean between dentist visits. High-quality stainless steel at a great price!
964. My dentist introduced me to this brand, and I’ve been using their mouthwash and oral rinse for years. I hadn’t tried the toothpaste or breath spray before, but these travel-sized versions are fantastic. The breath spray neutralizes bad breath rather than just masking it.
965. Don’t go without it!
966. This product works great for cleaning up grease that’s been left on the stove forever.
967. I’ve used Crest for years but got tired of it. I switched to Colgate, and I find it has a pleasant taste. The only downside is that the tubes have shrunk over time.
968. I bought this for my arthritis in my right thumb, and it’s such a relief. It makes clipping my nails effortless! However, the cutting mechanism is a bit large, making it better suited for toenails than fingernails.
969. I bought this for my grandpa, who uses a wheelchair. It made the transition between the hallway and kitchen much easier for him. We were so pleased that we’re ordering another one for a different area of the house.
970. I used the whole bottle and didn’t notice any difference.
971. This pill cutter is the best I’ve ever used. It’s made from medical-grade, BPA-free plastic, and its thin, sharp stainless-steel blade cuts pills cleanly in half without turning them into crumbs. The added painted line in the V-shape helps line up pills for a clean cut. It’s a bit larger than most, making it easier to handle, especially for people with arthritis. Plus, it looks sleek and attractive. Highly recommended!
972. I bought this for my toddler, who sometimes struggles to self-soothe at bedtime. The ball has a removable vibrating button, but my baby doesn’t like the vibration, so I took it out. Since then, he’s been doing great at bedtime. Be sure to remove the vibrating button if you’re not using it, as it can be heavy and uncomfortable for kids when playing.
973. Anyone undergoing cancer therapy should definitely try this! Check out their website for more information.
974. These didn’t fit my Pedegg model, though the value and quality were great. Unfortunately, I had to return them.
975. It works okay, but you can get a similar product for a cheaper price.
976. This has quickly become one of my favorite baby products. It's easy to use and effectively clears up my baby’s nasal passages. Highly recommended!
977. The scent of this alcohol instantly took me back to my childhood. We had so much stuff at home that it didn’t fit in the medicine cabinet, so this bottle sat on the third-tier shelf just outside the bathroom. It has a unique scent that I loved then and still enjoy today. I now use it like regular alcohol and sometimes apply it to my underarms instead of deodorant when I'm home, keeping me fresh and cool.
978. Exactly what I was looking for!
979. I bought this as a gift for my daughter, and she absolutely loves it! She says it works great.
980. Maybe it’s just me, but this creates a thick layer on my nails. On the plus side, it peels off in one piece, so no soaking is needed, but it doesn’t last more than a day or two. Considering the price, it’s a fair trade-off—I’m not paying $60 for DIY nails, so I can’t complain.
981. This cushion is excellent and made from the same material as Purple's bed, which I also recommend. It measures 18"x16" and is perfect for smaller chairs, like those in the kitchen or a computer chair. I personally use mine in my car (Dodge Durango) and find it comfortable, though I wish it was a bit larger. If you’re using it for a bigger chair or vehicle seat, I suggest going with the next size up, the Ultimate Purple Cushion. Overall, I’d rate it 4.5 stars, rounding up to 5!
982. These bags are designed with the Dallas Cowboys fan in mind, but even if you’re not a fan, the star logo makes for a pretty design. I use Ziploc bags for snacks, freezing leftovers, and even for making shake-and-bake chicken. They’re easy to seal, tough to tear, and the right thickness for food storage. Very satisfied with them.
983. This collagen powder is similar to others I’ve tried, though it has trouble mixing in properly.
984. It’s easy to put on, but once on, my feet get too hot and uncomfortable, so I had to take them off after just a couple of hours.
985. After trying so many masks, this one is by far the best. It fits well, doesn’t highlight my double chin, and has a metal piece for a snug fit around the nose. It’s pricey, but totally worth it.
986. I’ve tried others, but this one fits my hand perfectly when applying, unlike those that feel too large, like a baseball mitt.
987. I tried this once and felt terribly sick afterward. Not pleasant at all, and they don't accept returns.
988. These work wonderfully and don’t pull on your nose hairs like some other trimmers do.
989. This is a great bath pillow! I haven’t had any issues with the suction cups, unlike previous pillows I’ve tried. It’s lasted for years and is still going strong.
990. I bought four of these after purchasing one for our 4-month-old at a boutique. Our older kids loved them so much they begged me for their own! We now have the pink, purple, teal-green, teal-blue, and orange-yellow ones. They’re adorable and feel great, plus they help with cradle cap!
991. There’s very little product in this, and it didn’t seem worth the price I paid.
992. I know pure coconut milk tends to clump, but I’d rather have that than added starches to prevent clumping. My body doesn’t react well to those additives, and they mess with the taste as well.
993. I used this once, and it worked fine. However, after storing it outside in a bench, the dustpan became completely warped and unusable the next time I used it. What a waste!
994. No batteries to worry about!
995. I love these Elderberry gummies. With everything going on during the pandemic, anything I can do to support my immune system is a win. They taste great, and being vegetarian and GMO-free is a bonus.
996. The shipping took way too long, probably because it came from China. The case itself is okay—not super hard but has the strength of a shoe box covered in fabric.
997. Keeping screens, glasses, and face shields clean is a never-ending task. These wipes do a thorough job without leaving streaks or residue, so I don’t have to go back and polish again!
998. This little organizer is perfect for my needs, though it’s a bit bigger than required since I don’t wear much jewelry. It’ll help keep my jewelry from getting lost at the bottom of my bag when traveling.
999. This stuff is seriously hot! We were used to the regular green stuff and Max Freeze, but this "Pro-Mix" is packed with menthol. My physical therapist recommended diluting it with lotion, and it works wonders. You can make two tubes out of one. If you can handle it straight from the tube, you're definitely tougher than I am!
1000. It’s hard to say if it’s actually working, but it does seem to keep my bathroom air clean from germs and mold spores. It definitely helps with odors and gives me peace of mind knowing it's always running.
