Some bricks and mortar were a mess, so I repaired them, ground off excess mortar, and smoothed out some high spots. The result is impressive – it looks like it was professionally done 25 years ago. I'm amazed by how well this product worked. The true test is that my mom loves it!
I use glass files for my 4-month-old's nails instead of clippers, and they are by far the best! They’re durable and solid. I’m glad I found these!
This tissue is my favorite. I suffer from allergies, and it’s a lifesaver during the worst of allergy season, preventing a sore nose. It’s a great product!
Mybat once again delivers the perfect phone case for my new phone. I've switched phones three times in five years and this is my second Mybat case. It fits perfectly and includes three compartments inside for cards or personal items like a pet photo.
I mixed a generous scoop in cold, filtered water. It dissolved after a bit of stirring, turning the water a cherry red, but the taste was more like beets, with a slight earthy flavor. Despite being sweetened with Stevia, it wasn’t too sweet. I'll be using this in smoothies and kefir for the health benefits, even if the taste isn't the best.
I loved this pattern! It worked as expected, even after washing.
These work wonderfully for me. After trying many different options, I won’t buy anything else ever again.
This is significantly better than any white noise machines I’ve found. It actually pushes air, not just recorded sounds, making it ideal for those needing noise to study, sleep, or focus. If you need an alarm clock, you might need a separate one, but I highly recommend this product.
The scent is fantastic, and you only need 1-2 drops for a strong fragrance.
I really love this product. It pairs wonderfully with my mascara and looks great. I couldn’t be happier.
I’ve noticed a boost in focus and energy since taking two capsules. I appreciate that the ingredients are clearly listed with amounts, rather than a proprietary blend. It’s made a significant difference for me, and I’ve also noticed a reduction in appetite.
It helps relieve pressure from my back. The only reason for 3 stars is that I can't sit with this belt for more than 15 minutes before it starts causing cramps and pressure on my stomach. So I need to remove it each time I sit down.
These cleaning sheets are great. They dissolve instantly in water, and I use them for countertops and tubs. They’re budget-friendly and easy to carry, making them convenient for cleaning on the go. However, there are no instructions included, which is a bit of a downside.
I bought these as a gift for my husband, and he absolutely loves them!
My elderly disabled mother (5' 225 lbs.) has no issues using this. It’s sturdy and really helpful for her getting in and out of bed.
This ice roller is fantastic. It rolls easily, doesn’t stick even when very cold, and has a handle that’s easy to grip. The freezer case is great too, as it keeps the roller safe from food contact and doesn’t take up much space.
I bought this for my husband to help organize his meds for the month. It’s a lot more convenient than weekly pill organizers, and the removable compartments make it easy to access the pills without hassle.
I bought this creatine for my husband, and he’s been taking it daily. So far, he’s seen good results. The taste is pleasant and dissolves well in water, which is often a problem with creatine. It’s still early, but it seems to be working fine.
I have IBS, and these fiber gummies help a lot. They taste great, but don’t leave them in the sun since they’ll melt.
I bought this for an older relative who was having trouble with mouth sores. It’s been very helpful.
It works just as expected.
I’ve been using these for over three years, and I like them better than the black ones. They’re great!
This sleep mask is one of the most adorable ones I’ve ever seen. The floppy ears give it a 3D effect, making it perfect for dog lovers or Disney fans. It’s a little pricey, but overall, it’s a fun and cute sleep mask, especially for kids. I wish they had a cat version too!
We needed a first aid bag for our dog, and this one is perfect. It’s spacious and exactly what we needed.
The Freshcap Unwind instant drink mix tastes delicious. It’s not too sweet and dissolves perfectly in hot water, leaving no sediment. It has a coffee-like color and flavor but without the caffeine, making it ideal for bedtime. The product is effective, though I wish the serving size details were clearer.
I don’t usually eat nutrition bars, but these are my go-to when I do. They aren’t overly sweet, filled with healthy crunchies, and reasonably priced. It’s a shame they’re not more widely available.
We watched this film as part of our French class, and it received positive reviews. While it’s probably more suited for a younger audience, it’s still a solid film for anyone interested in children's stories.
This knee brace doesn't provide adequate support for those needing more stability. The side supports are made of plastic rather than metal, which makes them bend easily. The fit is also not ideal, leaving the user disappointed in the overall quality of the product.
A decent product for those looking to incorporate sea moss into their diet. The flavor is subtle and not overwhelming, and it works well as a thickener in smoothies and soups. The serving size is small, making this a long-lasting option. However, the taste and texture may not appeal to everyone.
The tools included with this blackhead remover set may be a practical backup if the machine doesn't work as expected. While the previous product may not have worked for the mom, the new one seems to be a more effective option. It’s a solid product for those who want an additional way to manage blackheads.
The extra softness of these products is a notable feature, providing comfort during use. Their effectiveness is likely tied to the gentle quality they offer.
This traction device stands out for its superior quality compared to others. It is comfortable to use and adjustable, offering good support during traction sessions. The company’s customer service is an added bonus, making it a reliable choice for anyone needing a traction device.
While this product initially stopped working, it was easy to fix with a few simple adjustments. After swapping the cutter head, the device worked well again. The grease used in the mechanism is suboptimal, causing issues with hair getting stuck, but can be remedied with alternative greases.
The Zep cleaning bundle offers great cleaning power, particularly with the all-purpose cleaner, which easily tackles grease and other messes. The glass cleaner is also effective but may require better technique to avoid streaks. The price point is a consideration, but the cleaning results justify the cost.
A solid walker option, especially for those anticipating a hip replacement. It’s sturdy, easy to adjust, and provides good lumbar support. The only downside is the cupholder's installation difficulty, but this is a minor issue considering the overall quality and value.
A helpful addition for low toilets, this product provides the necessary support for easier use. Simple yet effective, it meets the need it was designed for.
This blood pressure monitor is a reliable choice for those who need accurate readings at home. The features are straightforward, though the voice assist could be improved with clearer pronunciation. The unit's memory capacity and ease of use make it a solid option for everyday monitoring.
Unfortunately, this product did not meet expectations and was returned. It was likely not a good match for the intended use.
While this product is meant to alleviate neck pain, it didn’t offer the expected relief. The discomfort experienced while using it suggests that it may not be a suitable solution for everyone, particularly for those with misalignment issues or stress-related pain.
This foot care kit is perfect for tackling cracked heels and calluses, particularly during seasonal changes. The included tools are durable and easy to use, making foot care a simple routine. The nail brush is a helpful addition for daily maintenance.
An outstanding product for cleaning fireplace glass. The soot comes off effortlessly, unlike other products that require scrubbing. It’s a must-have for anyone maintaining a wood-burning fireplace.
Overall, this product performs well with various accessories, especially the facial hair remover. The nose trimmer could be better in terms of assembly, but it functions fine once reassembled. Though not perfect, this product offers good value for money and has earned a positive review.
The combination of ingredients in this mix is appealing, especially for those seeking a comprehensive solution. However, the review is incomplete, leaving some details about the product’s benefits unclear. The user’s positive experience likely stems from the product’s formulation.
Pro: Easy to use and lightweight. Con: Just keeps me from moving my head without turning my shoulders. Neck brace. Doesn't pull my neck up for adjustment like I thought it would.
This is something my husband takes with his vitamin regiment. He likes the taste.
This is a very nice toothpaste. It is definitely funky using toothpaste that is black, but you get used to it. It tastes pretty good and cleans your teeth very well. I would recommend mixing it up with regular toothpaste though because it can strip your teeth because of the charcoal. It does have some bad breath-eliminating features, which I like, and it can help whiten your teeth. Don't expect to have bright white teeth because of this, but it can neutralize some stains, which is nice. I really like this one, but I am not making this my only toothpaste. I actually rotate it with another one I use.
Complete waste of money, does nothing—just like wearing a regular pair of socks.
This is a great product! Very powerful, please follow the mixing and use instructions.
The product you get comes in three syringes. You apply 1ml to a spoon and eat the gel. It's fussy and kind of weirdly flavored. The whole syringe thing is weird. It is best refrigerated after you open each syringe. Yes, I believe it is a good product and effective! However, the delivery system is really most suitable for people who have syringe fetishes and a lot of time on their hands. I'd much prefer to have had the product in a softgel.
I got this for my wife, who was in the process of quitting smoking. She said the setup for this device was straightforward, and the app is easy to use. The device is accurate—if she had a cigarette, the CO2 numbers would be higher. For her, the CO2 number was a clear reminder of the progress that she was making. Overall, she recommends this as it helped her quit smoking.
I was so glad to find this supplement at this high dose. I'm taking this several times a day now, every day, and can tell it is beginning to help with insomnia, foggy feeling, and concentration. The main purpose in taking this, however, is long-term, as it is supposed to prevent disabling memory loss. And I'll do anything I can for that. This brand seems to be top quality and knows what they're talking about.
It feeds your body what it might be lacking. It's overall something that should be a part of your daily routine. I would get it again.
Came in my monthly box. Works as intended. Box wasn't damaged. Seals were intact.
These are posted & listed with "33% more loads" with 66 as total. I received 2 of the regular-size bottles with 25 loads (50 total loads). Please correct the listing to reflect the normal size bottles.
The foot bath is nicely designed. The only issue I have is that I like the temperature at 90 degrees. Even when I set the temperature to 90 degrees, it heats up to more than 100 degrees (see photo). There may be an issue with the thermostat.
It’s SO hard to find a chapstick that is both cruelty-free and vegan, so while I did consider these a bit pricey for chapstick, it’s definitely worth it! Most of the flavors are amazing—I especially love the peach coconut one. However, the patchouli one is kind of strange. It smells/tastes like I just smeared incense on my lips, and not in a good way. It almost has a smell that seems like it should not be going on my lips. Like I said though, the other scents are amazing and very moisturizing. Definitely will be buying more of these!
Too too strong to wear. I get a headache and lose balance, and my eyes need to re-adjust.
Works well, nice good deal.
This product contains lead! Completely shocked it’s still on the market and being sold. Disgusted that this product is being sold on Amazon.
Just the right shape for shoulders, and it holds heat well.
This powder mixes in well, although the directions say to mix in two whole scoops. It tastes pretty good, except that it does have a bit of that protein flavor. All in all, it's pretty decent for the price.
The rolls are tiny, the paper a bit harsh, but it does the job.
These are my favorite whitening strips!!! I have purchased them twice now. I love how gentle they are because my teeth are a little sensitive, and I cannot handle the products that come with LED lights or professional whitening done by a dentist. I have also tried charcoal whitening products, and I found them to be too abrasive. Other brands of whitening strips, such as Crest, I have found too harsh. Mr. Bright strips can be left on for 10-30 minutes, and you can use them occasionally for a "touch-up" or consecutively for the full 14 days. I had to write a review for this product because I recommend it to everyone. Do not expect dramatic results because they are gentle and an OTC item, but they are definitely worth it. I think the results are noticeable, and they last for a few months. I tend to use these a week before a special event or if I just feel like my teeth are looking dull.
These headphones are made in China, and while the sound is okay, they tend to get hot and the quality isn't great for the price. They might be suitable for a young kid but don’t expect much.
A chiropractor recommends this adjustable traction device for its comfort and effectiveness in relieving tension and improving range of motion.
Pampers wipes are preferred for newborns, but Huggies is favored as children get older, especially for hand use. Pampers wipes are more durable, though both brands are liked for different reasons.
These are great for polishing up your skin, especially for the summer.
The product is handy, useful, and holds up well.
The pill organizer has lots of room and is easy to open, though the cover might peel over time due to being made of PU leather.
Grenade makes one of the best tasting low-carb bars. Their flavors are highly rated.
This special material c-ring is exactly what the reviewer wanted. They plan to buy more.
These maracas are really nice, and the reviewer plans to buy another pair.
The product is great value, soft, warm, and covers well for a large person. It’s highly recommended.
The package arrived in great condition, and the reviewer loves these Puffs for the low price.
A chair with a 550 lb weight capacity broke one of its wheels despite the reviewer not reaching that weight. Customer service was not helpful, but the reviewer fixed it with replacement wheels.
The decorative pieces are pretty but don’t enhance the smoking experience much.
Lightweight, colorful, and comfortable on the neck, these items are appreciated.
The reviewer is disappointed that the heating pad didn’t work but appreciates its soft packaging.
The reviewer uses supergreens for fasting and is happy with its taste and natural flavor.
The glass nail file works well, but the other multicolored files are not as effective and just take up space.
The reviewer recommends this product for doing their own nail tips.
This neck traction device is helpful in relieving neck and shoulder pain but may be uncomfortable at first. The extra accessories like a carrying bag, eye mask, and earplugs are a nice bonus.
This boot spray effectively prevents foot odor, though the scent might be too strong for some.
Very cheap, but the product does the job.
The lint remover works well and is easy to use, even for clothes that have become worn and ugly with pilling.
Senna is effective for digestive purposes and works quickly, especially when mixed with honey and lemon.
The reviewer is happy with how well the product cleaned their shower.
After maintaining a weight of 250 pounds for six years, including times when I ate less or exercised more without seeing any weight loss, I’ve dropped to 230 pounds in just three months using MCG. I eat whatever I want, though I’m much less hungry than before, and I no longer crave sweets (which is rare for me). I’m not exercising at all. For context, I’m 46 years old and 6’4” tall. I have 30 more pounds to go, and the only reason this is a four-star review instead of five is that my weight loss seems to have plateaued. It’s hard to find clear guidance on whether it’s safe to take more of the supplement or how much, which is frustrating. I’m not loyal to any particular brand but have stuck with Miracle because it’s worked for me so far (and I still have three bottles left). To those who didn’t see any benefits, I’m sorry to hear that. I’ve been eating steak, chicken, salmon, rice, homemade pasta, quality cheese, fresh fruits and veggies, and other homemade foods, and find that I’m eating much less of these foods now. The supplement is pricey, but I’ve saved money by taking leftovers for lunch. Assuming my cravings stay under control and weight loss resumes, I’m really happy with the results. After six years of struggling with weight, losing 20 pounds in 90 days seems like progress.
I’m really impressed with this contact lens cleaner. It works best for me.
This isn’t your typical powdered horsetail—it’s 7% extract, meaning it’s stronger but also very bitter. I prefer a milder taste and didn’t like the added extract. It’s also not green like fresh horsetail powder should be. This one’s from China, whereas I usually buy from Starwest Herbs, which sources organic horsetail from Croatia and it tastes much better. Although BulkSupplements is great for vitamins and amino acids, I’d recommend Starwest or Frontier for herbs over this product.
This product works well!
This is my third or fourth order. I’ve been using it for my cats with renal issues, and so far, it seems to help. I just add it to their daily drinking water, and they don’t mind the taste, if there’s any. It dissolves easily in water.
Bought these hoping the coating would help with lower gut issues, but they didn’t work. Sometimes they pass through undigested after 12 hours.
I bought this for my husband to avoid the mess of regular powder, but while it is less messy, it doesn’t work as well. He said it feels greasy, which isn’t ideal for keeping areas dry. This product isn’t a good substitute for powder in his opinion.
I’m so glad I found this supplement in bulk at a much lower price than at my drug store.
One heaping teaspoon feels like eating 3 pounds of carrots, which is a lot to consume daily, but it's still a great product.
After using this air purifier for a week, I’ve had no odor from the litter box. It’s nearly silent, and the only indicator it’s on is a soft blue light. It’s worth the price for odor management, though I can’t confirm its effectiveness against germs. If you have pets, this is a great choice.
These large bottles offer great value for the price. I’ve used this brand before and trust it. The pills are easy to swallow and there’s no fishy aftertaste.
These decorations were great for my birthday. I’d definitely recommend them for anyone in need of similar decorations!
These hemostats are really difficult to open and close, nearly impossible to do with one hand. I’ve used many other pairs, but these are by far the worst.
My husband likes this dental plaque remover. It’s not a replacement for professional cleaning but helps maintain between visits. The lack of instructions is a downside, though, as you’ll need to figure it out yourself. It works, but we need clearer guidance.
These nail cutters aren’t good.
This portable pee bottle is handy for emergencies. I’m keeping it in my emergency kit for use if needed.
I love this product! It works to prevent bug bites and sunburns without the strong smell of typical bug sprays. I’ve used it on my 8-month-old without any rash or reactions.
Works well, and the price is good.
I had to return this item because the handle was stuck and wouldn’t come out of the case. I contacted the manufacturer, but they were unhelpful. I replaced it with another WSP Monarch Silver Tip Badger.
It’s not bad—better than my car seat.
Some people call facial tissue by just one word, but here's why I wouldn't. The pros are that it’s softer and has better boxes than others. But seriously, add them to your subscription and stop reading this review!
The product was delivered on time and in excellent condition. Very satisfied with my purchase.
Thanks to the Amazon VINE program for providing this item. A positive review wasn’t required, and these are my own thoughts. My mother and I use heat therapy for pain management. This microwaveable pack provides moist heat and is easy to use on difficult areas like the knees and shoulders. It’s heavy, but it stays in place and provides substantial relief. It heats up well and stays warm for a while. We love it!
I absolutely love these prerolls. They're made from natural cotton cellulose and smoke so smoothly. Highly recommend purchasing!
I’ve wanted a Henry mask for a while, and now that I’ve bought one, I’m impressed. It fits well and is breathable, as advertised. The straps are comfortable and don’t irritate me. I’ll be buying more of these masks.
I don’t like vinegar, but I decided to try it after reading how useful it is for many things.
This product works well for my 91-year-old mother.
I purchased this to help with constipation, but after several days, I found it made things worse and caused bloating. I wouldn’t recommend it for constipation issues.
This product seems to be legitimate. I was hesitant about third-party sellers, but it appears to be genuine.
My husband wasn’t impressed with the orange flavor. It took a lot of product to taste the orange, and the flavor was subtle. The shipping cost more than the product itself, which wasn’t a great deal unless you buy multiple flavors. It’s okay, but I won’t reorder.
Acai is great for reducing appetite. While I didn’t lose much weight, I did notice an improvement in my skin's clarity and radiance. The antioxidants help protect cells, so it’s good for skin health, though not as effective for weight loss as advertised.
These pads work great. Nice quality.
This glasses strap stays on well, even with thin ear pieces. I’d definitely order it again.
I love this product—it's all natural and lasts a long time. I’ve found ways to save money by making it last longer.
This product works well—my legs are incredibly soft after using it.
This compact pill case is classy and simple. It looks great on my keychain with brown leather and brass items.
The packaging is cute, and the scooper makes it easy to fill my water bottles. However, the cherry flavor has a weird, plasticky aftertaste. I drink caffeine powder mixes daily, but this flavor didn’t meet my expectations. The other flavors might be better.
This is the best product ever! I feel and look hydrated, and it works great for joints. Highly recommend it.
These socks are amazing. The fabric is soft and smooth, and they feel great on my skin. The bright, colorful designs are a fun change from the usual drab compression socks. However, the design stretches when my calves are swollen, which affects their appearance.
Comfortable gloves, perfect for dishes and gardening, with a long sleeve that prevents water from entering. Great price for two utility gloves.
Not suitable for me due to stomach upset.
Love the dry brush! Improves circulation and leaves skin feeling soft and tight. Worth the purchase, will buy a handle soon.
Thicker than expected but still flexible, suitable for cleaning. Great for people with latex allergies.
Delicious flavor, creamy and satisfying. Best when warmed up for a few seconds.
Works well for cleaning but requires an external floor cleaner for sticky residue. Pads wash nicely.
Detergent packs work well, but they have a strong off-putting odor upon opening.
Good product but hard to attach to the walker. Suggest using a two-sided rubber trivet to reduce sliding.
Tastes great for grilling and salads, but I don't like the plastic bottle. Prefer transferring to a glass one.
Okay massager, good for lower back but not for neck. Underwhelming compared to another brand.
Works as expected.
Attractive bath bomb set with subtle scents. A fun surprise inside and leaves skin feeling soft, though there may be slight color residue.
Blocks light perfectly for sleeping, comfortable fit.
Cute and functional nail trimmer.
Poor quality, thin and breaks after a few uses.
Helps with digestion and bloating when taken with meals, improves energy levels.
Compared to Emergen-C, this has more zinc but less Vitamin C. Suitable for those needing more sodium.
Doesn’t curl lashes well, but customer service was excellent.
Cherry Almond body lotion is non-greasy, helps with dry skin, but the scent is not long-lasting.
Not as expected, essentially just a piece of velcro.
Effective for treating styes, no side effects after consistent use.
High-quality eyelash curler at an affordable price, works better than high-end alternatives.
Organic turmeric powder is great for making Golden Paste, which has helped with joint health and pain relief.
Wipes are lint-free, but they dry out quickly and are difficult to hold. Need to use two at once for effective nail polish removal.
Aromatherapy blend is refreshing initially but doesn’t last long enough to notice significant effects. Not sure if it justifies the price.
Saved my shoes after two applications, highly effective.
Cute and comfortable Christmas hat, fits well.
Bought for daughter-in-law to practice at home; she loves it, and the delivery was fast.
Handy beauty wipes, great for toners or wrapping beauty products. Long-lasting pack, perfect for beauty enthusiasts.
The Male Comfort Fit Advantage is incredibly user-friendly. It's simple to use, and the process of emptying and cleaning it in the morning is straightforward.
Admitting that I’m getting older was tough, but it’s undeniable that my feet hurt, especially when wearing boots. After a few hours, the balls of my feet start to burn, and I have to take them off. I also have knee damage and a past foot injury, so now, more than ever, I’m aware of how foot pain affects my overall well-being. These insoles have been a game changer. They’re significantly thicker than store-bought ones, and even better than custom insoles I had made. The gel is thick and evenly distributed, making it feel like I’m wearing slippers all day. I live in Texas where boots are worn year-round, and these insoles have made a noticeable difference. They’re thicker, so I wear thinner socks, but they fit perfectly in my boots. While I don’t know exactly how negative ion technology works, I don’t need to. I’ve never been more comfortable in my boots, and I plan to replace them every six months as recommended. After my first day wearing them, my daughter tried them and was equally impressed. She didn’t expect to love gel insoles, but now she does. I wholeheartedly recommend them!
I was expecting a case to come with it, but it didn’t, and the product doesn’t work very well.
The bright colors against the black background of this poster are striking. While I do wish the details were more intricate, it’s still a perfect fit for beginners.
I recently purchased Emmy's Best Pet Odor & Stain Eraser, and it worked wonders! My dog had an accident in our family room, and the smell was overwhelming. After following the instructions, the odor and stain completely disappeared, and my dog no longer shows interest in the spot. I’ll definitely be a repeat customer!
This product is great for those times when I’m feeling overwhelmed, especially when I can’t sleep or unwind after a busy day. I trust Source Naturals because they’ve consistently provided high-quality products. I’ve been taking L-Tryptophan for a few months now and have experienced noticeable benefits.
At first, I was concerned it might break during installation, but a tech from Drive Medical helped me over the phone, and everything went smoothly. It was installed in about five minutes, no tools required. The product works perfectly and has all the features recommended by my occupational therapist. It even arrived within 24 hours with no extra charge!
This product is a lifesaver! If you have a child with nasal congestion, this makes everything easier. It has different suction settings and is easy to clean.
I’m very satisfied with this purchase. The quality, packaging, and delivery were all excellent.
For the price, this product is definitely worth it. I’ve had no issues with it in the year that I’ve owned it, and it’s been incredibly helpful.
I followed the instructions, and it really helped with my slow kitchen drain. It’s been two weeks, and everything is still running smoothly. I’ll keep using it as maintenance.
I’ve tried several foot spa machines, and this one is by far the best! There’s enough room for my husband, even with his size 11 feet. I love the remote control, the built-in drain, and the heater that warms the water. The rollers on the bottom make it easy to move around, and the cover and tools are great bonuses. Although it’s a bit pricey, it’s definitely worth it.
These face shields are comfortable, but I wouldn’t wear them without a mask underneath, due to the gap on each side. They work fine for basic splatter protection but aren’t suitable for comprehensive face coverage.
I appreciate the backlight on this device; it makes it much easier to read and is accurate too.
While these masks are soft and comfortable, they do not prevent fogging when I wear glasses. The fabric allows breath to pass through, causing fogging in cooler temperatures, which is a major downside.
This toothbrush is okay. The base feels cheap, and the heads are difficult to attach. The bristles are soft, and while it has multiple vibration modes, I'm not sure how much they actually improve the brushing experience.
They could be a bit thicker to hold the loop better.
This is great for rinsing off contact solution. I appreciate that it comes with three cans.
I regret buying these bars. They’re essentially soy and sugar, not a healthy alternative to other sweets, despite the marketing. Don’t waste your money.
I have very dry skin, and this cream works wonders. It lasts 24 hours on my body, though I need to reapply several times a day to my hands. It’s worth the price.
Doesn’t always provide accurate readings.
This works well as a thickening agent, whether for pudding or finger jello.
Nice bath wrap.
These cushions are very comfortable, especially for long car rides. They’ve made a significant difference for my hips and sacroiliac joints. My husband tried it and loved it, too.
I love that these won’t slide off my glasses.
This white noise machine offers six sounds and is battery-operated. It’s easy to use, but the sounds are limited, and the nightlight feature isn’t as useful as I had hoped. While it looks nice, I’m not completely satisfied with the performance.
These bars taste more like a snack than an energy source, but they work great. The variety pack is a perfect way to try new flavors.
One pair of these went too far into my ear, but I was able to remove it with tweezers. The larger set doesn’t block much noise.
This curling tool works perfectly, but it doesn’t hold a charge long enough to style my whole head. It died after just 20 minutes, which is frustrating.
This spray smells wonderful and gets the job done. It also comes with a nice microfiber towel, making it perfect for cleaning yoga mats.
Works well for my yard waste.
Excellent bee pollen! It’s satisfying and tasty, though it’s quite expensive. I’d buy more if it were half the price.
This TENS unit is a great purchase for relieving shoulder and neck pain. It’s easy to read, even for someone like me with poor eyesight. The pads remain sticky after multiple uses, and I’ve found it to be much more cost-effective than seeing a chiropractor regularly.
The low pressure from this replacement makes the machine useless. Update: After three months, the larger button sticks, making it completely unusable.
This eucalyptus oil doesn’t have a strong scent, but it’s a good quantity for the price.
Living in Savannah, Georgia, this product is the only thing that keeps the bugs away. It’s a bit oily but works well.
Great price, and it works as expected.
The opening is narrower than anticipated. If you're seeking a toenail cutter for thick nails, you might want to explore other options. I'll continue searching for a better fit.
A great product! I initially thought the bottle was glass, but it's actually plastic. I appreciate that it's not easily breakable and has an expensive look. It's also easy to swallow.
These don’t seem as effective as I remember from childhood, but they still get the job done. Even 12 or 14 tablets work as well as a full dose. Fun for kids, though I likely won't purchase again due to the price.
I tried this out with something I'm not very familiar with. It's not a product for me, but I’ve seen my mom use it before.
I used them when I had to stand for extended periods. They helped alleviate my foot discomfort.
The vitamin C in these gummies is ascorbic acid, which scientific research suggests isn't the ideal form of vitamin C. However, the zinc is beneficial for supporting the immune system against cold viruses. These gummies taste great, and I could easily finish the entire bottle if not for my self-control, but I'm not fully sold on the vitamin C source.
Excellent product at a reasonable price for its quality.
I love that this is compostable! It removes much more debris from my teeth compared to Glide floss.
They may contain more Omega-3s, but I haven’t noticed a significant effect compared to other pills. They’re not as large as some but still larger than others.
Perfect for icing my lower back during arthritis flare-ups!
Very thin and don’t fit well.
These are undoubtedly the most comfortable panties I've ever worn. The fit is perfect, and they never ride up or down. They feel durable yet incredibly soft, and I’m confident they'll last. Plus, they don't show panty lines, even under tight clothing. I bought them for $39.90 (now $36.90), and I'll definitely be purchasing more soon.
What a fantastic foot-care product! The metallic turquoise coating is visually appealing, and its ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold. The nano-blades easily file away rough skin, and the powdered skin particles rinse off effortlessly. The product comes with a convenient storage pouch. I’m really impressed with this affordable item!
I bought this as a gift for my 12-year-old grandson, who plays hockey. Since we have the Blue Orange version, I’m sure he’ll love playing it with his teammates on their trips.
These are delicious and really help.
Can't use smokeless tobacco at work? No problem! Try these Teaza pouches—they taste great and help satisfy cravings temporarily.
For women, going to the bathroom outdoors can be tricky. We bought this product for use with our Luggable Loo, and it did a great job controlling odor.
These clippers, available under different brand names, get the job done. They’re well-built, with precisely machined cutting edges that stay sharp after years of use. I recommend opting for the larger size regardless of your finger size. The small size is harder to grip.
I had trouble finding this in stores, but I’m glad I found it online. It’s a great product, easy to use, with no harsh chemical smell, and it rinses off without leaving any residue.
Not worth it. It didn’t seem to do anything. Despite being tight, it allowed water in and soaked the gauze I needed to keep dry.
Product as described. I have long, fine, straight hair, and though this brush doesn’t detangle it in a miracle fashion, it’s still better than using a regular brush that pulls too much.
I was disappointed. After using the Herbal Body Wrap Gel for a week, I didn’t notice any significant results. I was hoping for more as I used it to complement my new yoga routine. 
Great product. I’ve ordered this multiple times for my great uncle, who tends to brush his teeth too aggressively.
I liked this bottle, but after using it on my glasses, it stopped working. I thought it was a glass cleaner, but it only lasted a few hours after I cleaned my glasses.
I absolutely love this product.
I enjoy my hot heart massager. It’s reusable and remains ready to use until I flex the internal metal button. The solution crystallizes and generates heat, and the heart stays flexible even after the crystals form, making it great for hot massages.
Fits true to size, great quality, comfortable, non-fading, and reasonably priced. However, after wearing them four times, I noticed holes in the leg area, which was disappointing.
This glove set is well-made, comfortable, and durable. The blue pair has a soft flocked lining, and the unlined gloves are sturdy. Despite being thick, they remain flexible and tactile. The size medium fits perfectly, and they’re long enough to reach a 5-gallon bucket.
This set of 30 shiny gold boxes is ideal for Christmas gifts or lightweight treats. They are easy to assemble and sturdy enough to hold cookies or small cakes. However, they’re thinner than expected, so I recommend adding tissue paper or foil at the bottom for extra support.
My dad’s glasses caused friction that left his nose looking like Rudolph’s. Luckily, I found these, and now he’s back to his usual self without the red nose.
This shake tasted awful. I tried mixing it with different things to mask the flavor, but nothing worked.
The stool is easy to assemble and rolls smoothly over both floors and carpets. The cushion is comfortable. I’ve read some reviews about its durability, but I’m hopeful mine will last a long time.
A convenient way to protect credit cards from fraud. The push-button opener works smoothly, and the case fits all my cards. It slides easily into my pocket or purse, giving me peace of mind.
I love this product!
I’ve been using Swanson products for years, and this one remains a staple in our home for various uses, including poison ivy prevention and pain relief (research Rhus Tox for its many benefits).
After a few days of dealing with a runny nose, regular tissues can leave the skin around your nose feeling sore and irritated. While sniffles are manageable, the raw skin is not. These tissues are a lifesaver—they're the best option I've found so far. Treat yourself to these!
This brand continues to impress with their beautiful designs and great pricing. The quality is top-notch as well. This is my third pair, and I'm still very happy with them.
As someone who uses tissues every morning, I have a box in every room. I can't imagine going without them—they're a must-have in my daily routine.
While the fit is perfect for slimmer bodies, it may not accommodate plus-size or curvy figures. However, they’re well-made with a wide, textured waistband. The interior is soft fleece, and the exterior is smooth. They stretch, but not extensively. They're form-fitting yet comfortable. The care instructions suggest hand washing, but I washed mine in a lingerie bag on the gentle cycle with cold water, and they turned out fine.
These blocks out all light effectively, but they don't completely block sound.
We've been using Happy Bowls for years, and they’re a camping essential for us. They're such a great innovation!
I bought a large container of berry lemonade, and while I like it, I’m curious about the source of its blue color. I would have preferred a more natural hue.
At first, the taste of this liquid vitamin was hard to get used to, but after a few days, it became tolerable. I've already noticed an increase in my energy levels!
The taste was unpleasant, and my three kids, who usually enjoy this type of product, hated it. We’ll stick to the lemon-flavored fish oil for now. The citrus flavor doesn’t improve the taste, and it has an unpleasant algae-like scent.
These gloves are incredibly soft and comfortable. With my wide hands, I felt no restriction while wearing them, and I kept them on all night. Combined with Ancient Greek Remedy Oil, they healed my dry, cracked hands overnight, something no daytime hand cream has ever done.
It’s easy to use and clean, but it does require a lot of water to create the vacuum. While I could siphon the water to change it, the 30-foot distance to the sink makes it a bit challenging. I may try this method in the future due to the water usage.
I love this soaker so much that I’ve purchased more for family members!
I’m older and suffer from recurring shoulder pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome. Some days, my shoulder feels stiff and heavy. After placing the pads on the front and back of my shoulder, the TENS unit helps ease the pain and stiffness. It doesn’t eliminate the issue, but it definitely provides relief without medication.
The product was great, but some of the letters didn’t have valves for air, so we couldn’t blow them up.
Perfect weight and excellent quality!
After struggling with making fermented vegetables using just sea salt, I tried this culture and it worked wonders! My vegetables turned out great, and I’ll be making more soon.
It’s okay, but my hair dye was too thick, and I couldn’t use the bottle properly. It’s also a bit expensive.
While it scrubs well, the 360-degree swivel action doesn’t stay in place.
This blended well into my smoothies, and I didn’t notice much of a taste difference compared to the other ingredients.
The color is more of a dull gold rather than a bright, shiny gold.
This Japanese-style bench is a fantastic addition to my bathroom. It’s perfect for sitting under the shower to wash my legs and feet without worrying about balance. I highly recommend it!
I love this dental floss and can’t find it locally. I hope it’s still being made. It’s the same kind my dentist gives me, and it’s the only floss that fits comfortably between my teeth.
This product contains a natural formula with 40 billion CFU per serving (2 capsules). The probiotic strains include Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, among others. The "Macktrek bi-pass technology" ensures the probiotics survive the digestive process. The capsules are easy to swallow, shelf-stable, and have a five-month expiration date from when I received them.
Our carafe was a mess inside, but this product is easy to use and works effectively to clean it.
I used this to make my vanilla, and it’s amazing! It’s the best vanilla I’ve ever had. I’ll definitely buy again.
I like this product—it works well.
As expected, but it’s too long to hang on the side of a wheelchair because it rubs against the wheel.
The product description was inaccurate about the size—it didn’t fit as expected.
If you’re serious about health issues, this product is excellent. It works well and comes with clear brewing instructions. Don’t waste money on others with incorrect ingredients.
These little cord locks improve the fit and comfort of masks. I use a small crochet hook to add them to the cords, and people really like this option on my homemade masks.
A close friend of mine recently lost a few of her beloved cats and is heartbroken. Since she does cat rescue, she’s very attached to her pets. I’ve been making her a bracelet with charms representing her animals and her late father. This wing charm is a perfect addition. It’s made of hypoallergenic, eco-friendly stainless steel and fits Pandora bracelets. I received this item for free to test, and I’m sharing my honest opinion.
The product I received didn’t match the photo. I got the short ones with the pointed ends, which are much lower quality than the squared-end ones shown.
I bought these for cleaning hard-to-reach spots around the house, and they’ve been very useful.
The product is great, but sometimes the fabric is cut into small pieces, giving you less cloth to work with. Be cautious when buying.
I ordered the wrong size, so I can’t yet assess how well they work. I’ll update the review once I’ve tested them.
Well-made, sturdy, and easy to use. The large compartments make it easy to access the pills, though sometimes they can get stuck in the grooves between the am/pm sections. Overall, it's a great design.
This ear and nose trimmer is solidly built and effective. It trims without pulling or causing injury, and it’s quieter than others. I recommend it.
I bought this to help control the smell in our cat’s litter boxes. It works okay, but I’m not sure it’s helped with the odor as much as I’d hoped. Also, the coupon inside the box was misleading—it only applied to one purchase, not all.
I didn’t notice much of a change after using this product.
I heard these are the best, so I bought three packs.
I hoped this would help with leg cramps, but I didn’t experience any noticeable relief.
Great value! Good price and quality—I’ll definitely buy again.
This dressing is excellent, though admittedly pricey. It doesn’t have an adhesive border, so you can use your own adhesive, which is great for sensitive skin. I wish it lasted longer, but it’s still a good product for wound care.
These makeup remover pads are great—one side for makeup removal and the other for applying toner. They’re made of bamboo and cotton, and they come with a bag for washing. Be sure to secure the bag tightly before washing to avoid spilling the pads.
This product works well, as it does exactly what it promises, helping you stay dry and clean.
I required a solution to organize my medical supplies at home, and this product has been ideal. It comfortably holds two blood pressure monitors, an oxygen meter, a glucometer, and additional small items in its outer pockets. I appreciate keeping all my medical equipment in one place, ensuring everything is neatly organized.
These are fantastic! They remain intact even in hot weather, making them easy to transport. I carry one with me regularly for a quick and healthy snack.
If you're looking for true noise cancellation, this product isn't the right choice. The silicone plugs don't seem to block sound at all, even though they fit in your ears. They feel no different from the usual foam plugs, so the noise cancellation is ineffective. I'll keep searching for a better option.
I have a lot of dark clothing, and with a shedding pet at home, lint is an issue. After trying several methods, this product has worked the best for removing lint and fuzz from heavy fabrics like hoodies and sweatshirts. Just remember to hold the fabric taut for the best results.
I was skeptical about this epilator after recent laser treatment, but it exceeded my expectations. It removed even the smallest hairs, which I didn’t think an epilator could do. The lightweight design makes it perfect for travel. I’m impressed!
This cling wrap is incredibly clingy, sticking well to food and surfaces. The material is thinner than others I’ve used, but it still seals food effectively. Dispensing it can be tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works great. I’ll continue using this compostable option.
The product is okay, but don’t expect much power. The description was misleading.
These insoles are great for my narrow feet and fit well in my flats after I trimmed them. They provide the right amount of cushion, reducing heel pain without changing how the shoes feel. A little tricky to cut, but ultimately, they worked perfectly.
I bought this primarily for its scent, which is very pleasant. It’s safe to use around pets when directed, so I’m happy with the results. Just make sure to follow the directions carefully, especially the time needed for pets to stay off the treated carpet.
It’s hard to tell if this product is effective yet. I haven’t noticed much of a change so far.
This product seems to help with my sleep and cools my body temperature down.
It’s showing positive effects so far.
I use this exclusively on my face and it works well.
I used to love these energy drinks, but since the formula change, they haven’t worked as well for me. The new version doesn’t have the same effect as the original, and I’m not sure I’ll repurchase.
The consistency is too thick for my preference. It’s not comparable to Muro 128.
I’m very pleased with the lavender-scented spray. It cleaned my mat effectively, leaving a fresh scent that lasted for weeks. If you're sensitive to smells, go for the unscented version, but I highly recommend this one.
I purchased the new model because of the added features, and it’s lived up to my expectations. Great service and a solid product.
I couldn’t get these earplugs to stay in place, as they collapse with the slightest pressure. After struggling for a while, I ended up discarding them. I’ll stick to the putty-style earplugs that always stay put and block noise effectively.
The product arrived with a crushed box and damaged tissue boxes inside, but everything is still usable. I’m disappointed by the poor packaging.
These pills work well for my inflammation, though I did have an issue when some spilled on my countertop. Thankfully, I could clean it up without permanent damage. The pills are easy to swallow and don’t leave an aftertaste.
Sometimes these rollers work, and sometimes they don’t. It’s hit or miss.
The foot spa is good, but it’s a bit small for me. If you tend to sit with your legs apart, it might not be the most comfortable.
This scale is of very high quality, and I’m satisfied with its performance.
I didn’t notice any difference after finishing the bottle. Despite trying different dosing methods, this product didn’t seem to have any noticeable effects on me.
This slip-resistant tray was a lifesaver while my boyfriend recovered from knee surgery. Now my dad uses it as a lap tray, and it works great.
Excellent samples from great companies! I absolutely love it!
These small capsules have been a great addition to my daily routine, offering a simple way to add more fruits and veggies without any issues. I was initially concerned about the size, but they are easy to swallow.
The product works great and is very easy to set up. Perfect for my needs.
This product provides excellent screen clarity, with a bright LED display. I love the USB-C compatibility and the fact that it comes with a carrying bag.
Unfortunately, the o-rings don’t stay on my glasses, rendering them useless. I ended up tossing them out.
I love the color and beads at the end of these bags. They’re durable and perfect for storing my jewelry.
This supplement is great for lowering blood sugar and aiding digestion. It’s not the most pleasant tasting, but if you’re used to herbal remedies, it’s easy to handle.
These are incredibly tasty!
I used these to make stacked cakes, and they worked perfectly.
I’ve been wearing this non-stop and absolutely love it!
This hot water bottle is fantastic—well-made and includes two stoppers for different applications. It stays warm for a long time, and the size is perfect for many uses. I’m very happy with my purchase.

The freshness is there, but the balls need to be charged after each wash. They don’t kill odors as strongly as I would like, but they’re gentle on sensitive skin.
I’m not sure what it is, but this product doesn’t feel real to me. I don’t like it.

This product works as advertised, helping with bunions and keeping zippers functioning smoothly.
These earplugs are a big improvement over the usual foam ones. They reduce noise to a manageable level, allowing you to still hear enough for conversations, which is a huge plus for me.
I find this dog brush to be quite effective. The handle is ergonomic and easy to grip, making it much easier to clean my dog's teeth compared to the toddler toothbrush I used before. It provides a more comfortable experience overall.
This product works well for keeping my contacts comfortable and clean. However, the price is quite high. I feel like the cost is inflated due to the brand's market dominance, considering how quickly it runs out. The amount you get doesn't last long, which makes the price feel excessive for a few weeks' supply.
This cleaner doesn’t perform as well as alcohol-based alternatives. 420 cleaner is far superior.
The product does not stay in place when placed on the back of the chair.
This is an excellent product—exactly what I needed. Perfect for my use.
It works, but not for long—loses effectiveness too quickly.
It works very well overall, meeting my expectations.
I’ve had this mop since its early release, and it’s by far the best one I’ve used. It picks up every speck of dust and debris, including pet hair. If you’re dealing with pets or live in a dusty area, this is the mop to get.
Installing this involves finding the right spot in your ductwork, which can be a bit tricky. You might need additional tools like a drill or Dremel, and the video instructions may not be as clear as they seem. While it was more manageable than installing a home humidifier, it’s still a bit more complex than a typical DIY project.
These are helping me, especially with foot cramps.
After being diagnosed with Gastritis and Colitis, I used this product and saw improvement in just a week. It worked better for me than a year of using Famotidine. I take 5 pellets daily and it’s making a significant difference.
The cane is perfect! Sturdy, reliable, and looks great. I previously bought a cheap folding cane, and this one is a significant upgrade.
These pads are helpful for shoes that are a bit too loose, especially if you’re between shoe sizes. They add comfort and make long periods of wear much more manageable.
I’ve been using this sensitive toothpaste for a week now and it’s really keeping my teeth comfortable. The flavor is subtle—pleasant, not overpowering like other sensitive toothpastes. It foams just right and I haven’t experienced any pain since switching.
The US Organic 100% Pure Frankincense Essential Oil is a great choice for anyone looking for high-quality essential oils at a reasonable price. It’s versatile with numerous health benefits, and I appreciate the larger size for better value. Highly recommended!
These are amazing! My heavy wetter now sleeps through the night without any issues.
Unfortunately, this product fell apart after just a week of use.
The boot was shipped on time, and it’s much more comfortable than other expensive models. I’m recovering from an injury and this is really helping.
Keeping teeth dry for whitening applications can be challenging with this product.
The velcro on this item is very itchy and irritating for clients. I recommend going with the drawstring type for better comfort.
This shake powder is delicious and a nice change from the typical chocolate, vanilla, or berry flavors. It tastes like oatmeal, which I love. Although the carbs are a bit high, I balance it out by using unsweetened almond milk or a green juice.
These were perfect for our ice cream party! I scooped ice cream into each one, added a straw and spoon, and placed them in the freezer. When it was time, everyone could pour their own soda over the ice cream. It was a no-mess, fun experience. Only issue was separating the lids—they stuck together quite badly.
I’ve found better nail files at Sally’s; these are just mediocre in comparison.
I used this powder on my dog’s wound, and it helped with healing. However, my vet warned me about its toxicity to dogs if ingested, so I stopped using it once my dog started licking the area.
This dental floss has a subtle mint flavor and lasts a long time. At 55 yards, one container will last about two months, so I won’t need to order more soon. It’s perfect for tight spaces between teeth.
This B-12 supplement is an easy way to get my daily dose, but it contains a massive amount—50,000% of the daily recommended intake. Be careful as this may lead to issues.
I’m pregnant with an indoor cat, and this device has been helpful in cleaning the air around the litter box. After using it for a couple of days, the air in the bathroom smells fresher, though I still use bleach for cleaning.
These glasses holders are lightweight and comfortable to wear. They keep my glasses right at chest level, which I find quite convenient. I also bought a pair with hearts, which I haven’t used yet.
I love this oil! I use it daily on my face, mixing it with essential oils. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin soft and smooth. No need for expensive creams anymore, and I’ve even received compliments on my skin.
This is a great superfood supplement to add to smoothies. It doesn’t overpower the taste, allowing the fruits and vegetables to shine. It’s perfect for anyone working out frequently as it provides nutrients without adding extra calories. I love the freshness and airtight packaging.
I’ve been a fan of Vital Proteins for a while, so when they released a Collagen Whey, I had to try it. Unfortunately, the taste and texture were disappointing. It felt watered down and gritty, so I’ll stick to the original collagen protein in the future.
Why not enjoy the actual superfruit instead of a supplement?
The double compartments are great, though the depth is a bit too much for my needs. It makes it difficult to organize tiny pills in the grooves.
This hot water bottle is a cute, fun novelty. While my cat was initially frightened by it, it turned out to be harmless and quite adorable.
I have sensitive skin, so I’m always cautious about trying new products. This toner, however, didn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s moisturizing and balancing, leaving my skin feeling soft and clear. It’s a great addition to my routine, and I plan to buy more.
These inserts have been a game-changer for my plantar fasciitis. After years of discomfort, they helped accelerate my healing. If I skip wearing them, the pain returns, but with them, I’m pain-free.
The nipple suckers didn’t work well for me. The syringe didn’t have enough suction, and the nipple correctors are too large for smaller nipples. I wouldn’t recommend these.
I bought these for my sister, and she was so impressed. They’re well-made, optically superior to her previous ones, and even received a few compliments on their design.
I bought this elderberry syrup for my grandkids, and they take it year-round. It helps keep them healthy.

I consulted with my doctors before adding this supplement to my daily routine, and they both approved. It’s a well-balanced mix of essential vitamins and minerals that has improved my overall health. I’m in my mid-thirties and have several ongoing health issues, but this supplement has helped me feel better. I’ll keep using it and recommend it to others.
I plan to mix this powder with Manuka honey to mask its bitterness. It’s supposed to be beneficial, and I’ll continue using it for its health properties.
I haven’t used this much yet, but when I did try it, I found that...
I’ve used this product twice so far, and while I can’t speak to its whitening effects just yet, I do appreciate its strong minty scent. It’s a nice bonus that it comes with two, so my husband and I are both giving it a go. After a month, I haven’t used it consistently, but even after one use, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.
I got this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves it. It’s now tracking me, her, and her son, and we’ve synced it with our Fitbit accounts. I even convinced my mother and sister to buy one for each other as a gift. Hopefully, it motivates them to stay on top of their fitness goals.
I mainly use baby oil to remove eye makeup, and it works much better than makeup wipes at a lower cost. It also doubles as a great body moisturizer when applied after bathing. I’ll definitely repurchase.
This product works well and is priced reasonably. As a nurse practitioner, I find it easy to use and reliable for monitoring blood pressure. I’d recommend it to anyone needing to track BP.
This product absorbs wonderfully and is gentle on painful wounds.
These pads are fantastic for alleviating pain in my knees and hips.
It works fine when your banana fits the shape. However, be aware that the ribs limit its flexibility to just a few degrees. If your banana doesn’t match the narrow molded shape, it might not fit. Also, very long bananas won’t fit. The open ends, however, allow for airflow and space for the stem.
I had hoped these caps would be soft silicone to stretch over my heels, but they are hard plastic and were too big for my stiletto on my wedding day. My bridesmaids had to improvise with toilet paper to wedge them onto my heels. They might fit thicker pumps, but they’re far from universal.
I’ve always made an effort to clean my dog’s teeth because it’s better than paying for dental cleanings. I’ve used dog toothbrushes before, but this dual silicone finger brush makes it much easier to clean the inside of my dog’s teeth. It works well for me, but it might not suit everyone.
I’ve been using this for a week, and while I think it’ll take more time to see full results, I do feel less tired. It’s part of a regimen recommended by my doctor.
These replacement toothbrush heads are a great deal for the Oral-B battery-operated toothbrush. I’m happy with them for the price.
While this product may work for some, I personally find it unappealing. I often have to mix it with juice to make it more palatable.
It works when you’re in a pinch.
This is a great way to store multiple brushes. I’m curious if they have something similar for razors.
The included glove is great for protecting your hand from burns. It heats up fairly quickly. My daughter’s long, thick hair requires small sections to avoid overheating, but the swivel cord helps with positioning. Overall, it works well.
These are an okay replacement in an emergency.
I’ve had this for almost a month, and it’s holding up great. It stays in place and has ridges to prevent slipping. This would be ideal for elderly users and it looks spa-like.
I just started using Benecol, and I’ll update my review in a few weeks. The packaging was excellent—arrived well-packed with cold packs despite the mild weather.
This product didn’t work for me and made my heart race unexpectedly. I’ve taken diet pills before, including ephedra, and never had this issue. Once I stopped using it, my heart rate returned to normal.
I really liked this set, although I ran out of helium, so I couldn’t use all the balloons. The confetti-filled ones didn’t float as expected, but the banner was still worth it. It was easy to thread the letters with the included needle tool.
These detergent sheets are convenient for kids in dorms or for long trips, but for home use, I prefer liquid detergent. They clean well and don’t leave a strong scent, but I need to use three sheets per load, which makes it less economical. They're great for limited storage spaces though.
It didn’t remove black marks or bring back the shine as well as I expected.
This cushion is helpful for sitting on hard surfaces for long periods. It’s not super soft, but it distributes pressure well, especially when paired with a regular chair cushion. My wife finds it helps alleviate her lumbar pain when sitting on a soft sofa.
The setup was a bit tricky, but after I figured it out, I’ve loved this scale. It syncs reliably (even better than my Fitbit) and has withstood being knocked over a few times. Not sure about the body fat reading, but the weight seems accurate. It syncs automatically with MyFitnessPal, which is a nice bonus.
These are absolutely amazing! After using them in the shower, I can breathe so much better. My allergies are relieved, and I can really breathe now!
After a while, it tangles.
I use this cod liver for its vitamins A and D, as well as omega-3. It wasn’t as smelly as the first batch, or maybe I’m just getting used to it! I season it with lemon juice or vinegar to reduce the odor. It’s a nutritious option without the bones.
Very fast delivery! These bags are strong and durable. At 4 mil thickness, they’re perfect for organizing my jewelry beads and stones. I expect them to help reduce storage space significantly.
Great product, and fast delivery.
These silicone face mask brackets are the best I’ve used. The silicone strap helps prevent glasses fogging, and they’re made from soft, non-irritating material. The storage cases are a nice bonus. Highly recommend!
It works okay, but it doesn’t leave a mark as cleanly as a cryptic pencil.
It does the job, but it requires cleaning after every use, which can get tedious.
I’ve used this brand for a long time, and this purchase was because I couldn’t find large refills locally.
The lemon mint flavor of this toothpaste is unique. I’m not sure about the silica in it, but I’ve read it could potentially wear down enamel. I like the toothpaste overall and it makes my teeth feel clean, but I’ll probably use it less frequently.
This cushion is very comfortable and makes long drives much more tolerable. It arrived quickly, and it definitely works as promised.
I prefer fluoride-free products, and this one is the best I’ve found so far. It whitens my teeth well, and though it’s travel-sized, a little goes a long way.
This product is colorful and lightweight, providing great sun protection for my face. I used iron-on hem tape to make it smaller to fit better.
My wife loves this product.
I’m a tall and heavy guy, and this stool works fine for my needs. However, after two months of use, a wheel broke and I found the design to be poorly constructed. The wheel socket is made of plastic and cracked, so I had to glue it as a temporary fix.
The scale works okay but seems to have a strange memory function. It jumps around when you first step on it, and even when I tested it by adding weight, it still showed the same number. I’m not sure I trust the readings.
This product is affordable and great for combination, acne-prone skin. I use it twice a day, and it’s really helped clear up my skin. The sponge lasts a long time, too. I highly recommend it.
The bags are cute, but the size was misleading. The instructions were also missing.
These bags were a hit at my med school friend's graduation party. They’re cute, not cheap-looking, and the perfect size for small gifts like candies and pens.
I feel a bit more energized and better overall, and I’ve managed to maintain my weight during Christmas.
Perfect for the barbershop!
I’ve used this product for years, and while it’s hard to find in stores now, Amazon carries it. The packaging was a bit crushed, but the tubes inside were fine.
These scouring pads are as good as any I’ve used. They scrub well and leave surfaces clean. I wash dishes often, and they last for a couple of months.
This 5-piece eye makeup kit is quite nice. The container is plain, but the brushes are durable and work well. None of the bristles fell out, and the quality is good. They’d make a great gift for a wedding party.
After using the sponge for a few weeks, I can confidently say it's one of those products I didn’t realize I needed. It’s incredibly gentle on my skin, and I love pairing it with my gentle cleanser. Initially, I was surprised by how it arrived – with a texture that felt like a rock – but after wetting it, it became soft and luxurious.
I received an unexpected email after placing my order, which made me question the product’s quality and security. However, considering the price, if the ingredients are as advertised, $90 is a fair deal.
This is a great value for a 3-pack, and the color is vibrant, which can be credited to BabyLips.
I’ve tried several homeopathic nasal sprays for sinus relief, and this one is probably my second favorite. It works well, but for me, the best option is “Seagate Olive Relief.”
This is exactly what I needed for my bottles with squeeze tops! I watched videos of a lady rearranging the slots to customize them, which was impressive! I got the completed box, but now I kind of wish I had bought the unfinished one. The smell was a bit off, and I’m concerned it may mix poorly with my oils, so I’ll leave it open for a week to air out.
Unfortunately, this just pushes dust around, and very little actually clings to the brush. I hoped it would improve after washing, but it didn’t. I should have returned it when I had the chance. I wouldn’t recommend it.
While the peanut butter flavor isn’t very strong, they are still quite tasty. Considering the low carb count and high protein, I’d definitely buy them again, maybe in the lemon bar flavor, which has a nice lemony taste.
This is a good selection of balloons for a graduation party. The confetti-filled ones were a highlight! The numbers were large, but one of them leaked right away. We taped it, but it never quite stayed as full as the others.
After trying a few ice bags and cold packs for a relative’s knee replacement, she prefers this ice bag at night because it gets colder and conforms well to her knee. Make sure to use the 11-inch size for knees as it provides the extra width needed. The wide opening allows you to fit larger ice chunks, avoiding the hassle of breaking ice into smaller pieces. Just make sure to dry the threads to avoid leaks. This bag has worked great so far!
I bought this for traveling since it’s easy to pack and doesn’t take up much space. After using it for a while, I continue to use it regularly because it works great. It’s much more space-efficient than bulky detergent tubs and never makes a mess.
The colors are unattractive.
I purchased the wrong size, but the item itself is good.
This product works exactly as promised! I was initially skeptical, but now I’m a believer. It’s cool to the touch, and you can adjust the heat level for your hair. It works on all hair types and is much easier to use than a flat iron, straightening hair without losing volume.
I’ve been using these wraps as a barrier between my skin and ace bandages due to extreme lymphedema. They’ve worked wonderfully! They not only stopped the sweating sensation but also allowed the small breaks in my skin to heal. Using lotion before applying the wraps made my skin smoother and healthier. I highly recommend these.
I don’t know why I keep selecting these strange powders to review. I can’t really tell if they have any effects on me, but I add a scoop or two of Astragalus powder to my smoothies each day. It blends well and doesn’t alter the taste, so if you're already interested in Astragalus, it should work well for you.
We liked how easy it was to scrape off the plates.
I use ziplock bags often, and I really like these because they have Texans on them.
Not sure about the warmth factor, but I love this flosser! It has different settings, and I use the soft one, which is still pretty strong. It works well, but be careful with how wide your mouth is open as the water can spray everywhere. The water tank lasts for two uses, and the charger lasts a long time.
I bought this kinesiology tape for my wife and me after our injuries, and it has been really helpful. My wife had a severe foot break, and the tape provided great support when she was cleared to start exercising again. It came in pre-cut strips, which was convenient, and it provided excellent support while she jumped rope. We’re both happy with this purchase.
Great for holding up four or five cigars, or two with a lighter.
These are terrible for my long, thick hair. They’re stiff plastic with no flexibility, and I couldn’t get them to work at all. A total waste of money.
I ordered this amethyst stone after hearing it could bring luck, especially since I’m an Aquarius. I was amazed by the beauty of the packaging and the positive energy it radiates. Holding it makes me feel calm and more in tune with my intuition. I even won a lottery prize after having it! It’s definitely a lucky stone for me.
My family loves this game! My kids, aged 8 and 5, think it’s a blast, and we always find time to play a game or two after dinner. It’s fun for both kids and adults.
These meals are delicious and filling.
We wish it were cheaper per bottle to buy three instead of two. But it’s our own fault for not reading the prices more carefully. Otherwise, the product is great, and we buy it regularly.
This is a great multivitamin that contains ingredients like Vitamin C, Elderberry, and Turmeric, which are known to support the immune system. Although it’s not clear how well these will protect against viruses like COVID-19, taking them certainly can’t hurt. I usually prefer gummies, but these are easy to swallow and effective.
I’ve been in ketosis for a while, but when I cheat with sugar and carbs, I get terrible calf cramps. This magnesium has been the only thing that alleviates the pain. Now, the pain from cheating is limited to weight gain, guilt, and the hunger pangs of fasting.
Don’t waste your time or money on other products! This one is effective and pet-friendly. I used it on carpets under two king-sized beds and still have plenty left. I’ll definitely be buying more to keep on hand.
It’s just a shoehorn, but let me tell you, it’s amazing! I’ve used shoehorns for years, but this one is the best. The handle extends, so I don’t have to bend over, and the heel section makes it so easy to slip my feet into my shoes. I love it so much, I’m buying more for my friends and family.
I’m not sure if this product actually does anything, but it’s not unpleasant. You can hear it within a 10-foot radius.
This works great for toenails.
I have three sets of these travel brushes in different colors, and they’re fantastic. They perform well, don’t shed, and are well-protected in their tubes. They’re perfect for keeping in your travel bag and still work just as well after years of use.
I can't believe how much better this Liposomal Vitamin C is compared to others I’ve tried. I had an infection in my gums, and after a week of taking this, the infection is gone. I’m so grateful for this product!
Exactly what I expected.
Let’s be honest, it doesn’t taste great, but it seems to work. It balances the system, boosts energy, and helps with regularity. As for claims about increased sexual appetite, I’m not sure yet. I mix it with sweetened tea to make it more bearable.
I've been using magnesium capsules for a while, but this topical form works wonders. I can feel the relaxing effects just minutes after applying it.
This “kit” has a strange number of items. The 3D face bracket is very small, maybe better for kids, and the extenders are made of hard plastic. It depends on the mask you use and the size of your face if you’ll find these useful.
The current price of $33.24 ($34.99 minus 5%) seems excessive for a product that primarily functions as a nightlight. Despite attempts to pair it with multiple Bluetooth devices, it failed to connect. The touch controls are unreliable, with the timer activating unexpectedly with any button press, the light turning on randomly, and the pause/move button seemingly non-functional. Additionally, the buttons on the bottom are illegible. While it serves as a nightlight, its role as a sound machine is limited by only offering five sounds. Overall, it’s overpriced for a quirky, partially functioning device.
These bags are incredibly flimsy and practically unusable. I tried opening one, and all five bags ripped apart immediately.
This KT tape is impressive, sticking well even after a couple of showers. It offers great value for the price, and I would definitely recommend it.
This foot scrubber has worked wonders for me. After years of struggling with sweaty, rough feet, I’ve found success with this product. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now, and my feet feel smoother than ever. The combination of this scraper and foot cream has transformed my feet, leaving them soft and healthy-looking.
These nail clippers perform well and are sturdy. They come with a protective foam in a convenient tin case.
I was hesitant to try Wen due to concerns about automatic shipments, but I eventually purchased it at Sephora. Initially, I wasn’t impressed, but after a significant haircut, I gave it another shot. I found that 5-7 pumps worked best for my medium-fine hair. The product has restored my hair’s health, adding shine, bounce, and smoothness. The scent of the orange blossom version is pleasant, though not exactly like the flower. I’m now a dedicated user of Wen and won’t use anything else.
This product has really helped with my joints and has contributed to a more positive mood. The quality is excellent.
Just as described, very satisfied.
Always dependable and helpful.
I bought two packs of these for travel. While they work well for sleep, I didn’t enjoy the overly sweet watermelon flavor. If you don’t like watermelon or overly sweet flavors, I wouldn’t recommend them.
I’m so glad I found this! The price was great, and I’m extremely happy with my purchase.
Taking this for cancer treatment.
It works perfectly; we can’t sleep without it!
The lid arrived cracked, causing the liquid to leak out. The packaging was poor, and I had to discard the product. Not satisfied and wouldn't recommend.
I love this product! It makes carrying my oils so convenient.
This is effective for pain relief.
The product took a few weeks to arrive, but they are great glasses.
I found this product in a health food store, and it’s been a lifesaver for my sensitive scalp. It immediately calms irritated areas and relieves itching. I plan to buy it again soon.
While the bristles are softer than expected, these brushes work really well and do a great job.
Be cautious if you wear jewelry, as it may get caught on this and potentially get damaged when you try to remove it.
These headphones don’t work as intended. Instead of reducing sound, they actually seem to amplify bass and low frequencies. Though comfortable, the lack of functionality renders them useless for their intended purpose.
The peppermint scent is refreshing, and the product works as expected. This company seems to offer quality natural products.
I couldn’t get past the taste. Even mixing it into smoothies didn’t hide the grassy flavor.
The product seemed fine, but the gift box packaging arrived scratched, so I had to return it. It’s an affordable option, but I’ll consider reordering in the future if I get a better package.
While it’s not the fastest product, it’s still good, and I can manage with it.
This insect repellent is easy to apply, non-greasy, and effective at keeping insects away from the treated skin.
This is a game-changer. No more dryer sheets or paper towel rolls. Plus, it doesn’t emit smoke, which is a bonus.
I’d prefer smaller tablets or two smaller ones for the same dose, as these are quite large and difficult to swallow.
I wasn’t able to continue with this supplement. While Myo-Inositol is beneficial for Hashimoto’s, I missed the addition of D-Chiro, which is useful for PCOS but lowers cortisol, and my cortisol levels are already low. As a result, I couldn’t continue taking it.
This powder is an herb that promotes liver detox and contains antioxidants. It has a slight earthy taste, which I tried to mix with iced tea, but it clumped. It might work better when sprinkled on a salad or blended into a smoothie.
This product is a great concept, but it tips over easily, which can be frustrating.
I didn't get the chance to try this, so I ended up returning it. Unfortunately, I can't recall the exact reason.
This is a reliable product containing well-known calming ingredients, some of which are commonly found in sleep aids. It can make you feel drowsy, so it's ideal for use in the evening, preferably before bed. If you're looking for focus or an alternative to ADHD medication, this is not designed for that purpose. For better focus, consider trying 200-400mg of L-theanine on its own. L-theanine is an affordable, pleasant-tasting powder that can calm you without making you sleepy. The cost per serving is about $1, which is reasonable considering the high-quality ingredients like KSM-66 Ashwagandha. You're paying for the convenience of a pre-blended capsule, which makes this product accessible to its target market. Made in the USA in a GMP-certified facility.
I've been purchasing these for quite a while because they are unscented and the right size. However, this time the packaging changed. The wipes no longer come in layers, making it harder to pull them out one at a time. It's frustrating as little hands can't get the next wipe easily, resulting in multiple wipes coming out at once. I hope the manufacturer reverts to the previous design, as this new one is not as convenient.
These shoes provide great relief for my foot pain. They're incredibly comfortable and stay in place, almost like walking on clouds!
I really enjoy the flavor of the Nectar brand, and this specific one was delicious. I mix it with fat-free milk for a smooth taste.
This facial skin scrubber is a decent little device. It has a stainless steel spatula that's easy to clean, and three different settings—cleaning, moisturizing, and uplifting. The cleaning and moisturizing settings are similar and require a solution to enhance their effect. The uplifting setting provides a unique vibrational sensation on your skin. It’s gentle, effective, and much kinder to blackheads than squeezing with your fingers or using harsh tools. Overall, it’s an affordable and worthwhile investment for your skincare routine.
This product was ineffective for me. I wouldn't recommend it.
I bought this shoehorn for my car. It’s particularly helpful for people with limited mobility, like myself. I can't feel my feet due to a medical condition, and this compact shoehorn (which folds down to 14 inches) makes it easy to put on shoes. It’s sturdy, affordable, and portable, and it works well. I would highly recommend it.
I’m really impressed with this shaver! It effectively removes my quarantine hair, and it was easy to use right out of the box. Fully charged and ready to go! I would recommend it to anyone.
I love baths, so I was excited to try this product. Watching it dissolve and create bubbles is fun, and the scent is refreshing and clean, thanks to the essential oils.
Solid purchase.
This product works perfectly and was easy to assemble. Exactly what I needed!
Unlike other filters, this one reduces fog on my glasses, which is essential when wearing a mask. I can now see more clearly through my glasses.
The material provides firm support and a comfortable cotton feel.
I got these for my wife, and while they’re easy to take, she’s not sure if they make a noticeable difference. Unfortunately, I can't say for certain if they’re effective.
I've been using these for homemade e-juice for years without any issues.
I never thought of using a pill box before, but it makes so much sense now. Lizimandu's pill boxes, inspired by Van Gogh, are great for traveling or daily use. They fit perfectly in purses or small bags. The only downside is the compartments are a bit small for larger pills, but a removable option would fix this. Overall, a well-designed product that's also a great gift idea.
I wasn't a fan of the original Soylent flavor, but adding fruits like pineapple, blueberries, or bananas made it taste much better. This chocolate flavor is great on its own, though. It’s convenient and satisfying but goes by quickly if you drink it regularly. I prefer buying it in bottles instead of individual servings.
This product does an excellent job of cleaning and removing dirt you didn’t even know was there. I love it!
This product is excellent for viewing photographic contact prints.
This basket fits perfectly on my dad’s walker, but it might not fit on walkers with straight supports. It’s ideal for curved ones.
This product didn't meet my expectations and I found it to be a waste of money.
I have low thyroid and rely on this regularly to maintain a healthy routine. It does have a chalky taste, but when mixed into my morning smoothie, it works perfectly.
I bought this at the recommendation of my physical therapist, and it’s been incredibly helpful for relieving joint pain in my knees, feet, and back while supporting my muscles.
I waited a full month before reviewing this magnesium supplement, and I’m glad I did. As a wheelchair user, I struggle with muscle spasms, and this supplement has worked better than muscle relaxants without the negative side effects. It's also more easily absorbed, and it’s a good option for beginners since the dosage isn’t too high.
I love the variety of colors and appreciate that these are hypoallergenic. They are just perfect!
I don’t use this product much and didn’t find it very impressive.
The material quality is good.
My immunocompromised child loves this chest rub, especially since it smells better than traditional Vicks. It’s soothing, leaves her skin soft, and helps with her recovery. We will definitely buy this again.
This product works well for me because it’s a 24-hour solution, so I don’t have to worry about reapplying throughout the day.
The brush is too soft for my liking. It’s more suitable for children and needs to be replaced every month. The instructions were hard to read, and I ended up returning the product.
To keep whites bright, I use Oxy and bleach together. Just don’t mix them in the same compartment! Oxy goes with detergent, and bleach should have its own dispenser.
I use these bags frequently, but after a few uses, they don’t perform as well. They are good for strawberries, though.
This product is excellent for reducing coughing.
This set is wonderful! It’s sturdy and well-crafted.
This is my go-to remedy when I feel awful. It’s a hot liquid, not syrupy, which I prefer. It helps me feel better and relax enough to sleep. The honey-lemon taste is perfect for soothing a sore throat. I love TheraFlu!
I use this product every day, and it works wonders!
It does a great job of stopping itching without leaving an unpleasant odor.
My son loves this! It’s fun, exciting, and doesn’t leave a mess.
These lip balms contain essential oils, but that’s not mentioned in the product description. As someone with allergies, this is important information. Now I have to return the product because it was misrepresented.
This product works exactly as advertised, relieving pain and making me feel better. I'm happy with my purchase!
These work wonderfully to keep my baby happy and regular, especially as we start feeding solids!
I bought this to reduce fog on my glasses during Covid. It helps, but the application process is different from regular eyeglass cleaner. While it doesn’t completely prevent fogging, it does reduce it.
This product comes with a rollerball, making it easy to apply. The scent is fine, though not extraordinary, and fades quickly. Unfortunately, it didn't provide me with the relief I was hoping for. I won’t be purchasing it again.
The concept of cleaning walls has evolved significantly with these products. The "magic" in their name is truly more fitting than I anticipated.
These gift boxes are both stylish and versatile, perfect for any occasion. They’re easy to assemble, and the kids' gold design adds a charming touch. A bit of tissue paper, and you're all set for gift-giving. The shiny finish is just right for various celebrations.
I've been using turkey tail mushrooms since 2014 for autoimmune hepatitis, and this brand has proven to be very effective. Taking just one a day for the past couple of weeks has made me feel more energetic, and I believe it's supporting my liver health.
So far, these have cut well. The real test will be how long they last.
The Innate Vitality Krill Oil has turned out to be a more affordable alternative to another brand I was using, which was nearly twice the price. I’ve been taking it for about three weeks, two capsules daily, and so far, I haven’t noticed any unpleasant aftertaste, only a very slight scent, typical for health supplements. While it's too early to tell if it will help with my blood pressure, I trust the research suggesting that Krill Oil is beneficial for cardiovascular health. I’ll be reordering once it’s back in stock and might consider subscribing for future orders.
Simple yet visually appealing. Adding tissue paper enhances the color, giving it a nice extra pop.
I enjoy these reading glasses for general reading in well-lit spaces. In dim lighting, I need stronger magnification, but these work great for most situations. They're attractive, come with cases (though a bit snug), and at this price, I can afford multiple pairs to keep around the house. Definitely a highly recommended option.
These are compact and lightweight, though if you’re traveling with free shampoo available, you might want to use that for washing clothes instead. Regular shampoo works quite well as a laundry detergent, though I’m uncertain about the kind with conditioner. I found the shampoo cleaner for some dirty hiking clothes than this soap.
I’ve used two so far, and they left me feeling quite fatigued the following day.
The texture is too grainy for my liking, requiring constant stirring to prevent settling, making it difficult to drink.
Just as expected. After use, I toss it in the washer. Works perfectly on my floors; I highly recommend them.
Perfect portion sizes for brushing teeth, mouthwash, and using the handy spray container for refreshing your breath as needed.
It works just as intended with no issues.
It smells as though a new unit has been installed.
A great product, though on the pricier side, it performs well.
These are fantastic gift options! The lavender scent is delightful, and the bath bombs are a good size. They last a while and transform your bath into a calming spa experience. The little lavender buds on top are a lovely touch.
I bought this to support my weaker knee with the added benefit of compression. It’s snug, but comfortable, and provides the support I need. I wish it came in a two-pack to keep my legs balanced, but I’m still happy with the support it provides for my one weaker knee.
Very easy to mix into a shake or water. I usually add mine to my morning water and have noticed better hydration.
This is excellent! I’m a light sleeper and need white noise to fall asleep. It’s loud enough for me! Although a bit pricey for a white noise machine, I’m happy with my purchase. I’ve been using it for six months now, and it’s been working perfectly.
I used this to clean marker stains off walls and some kitchen furniture. It required a bit of elbow grease, but it did the job. The walls and side table look great again, and it doesn’t irritate my sinuses. I highly recommend this for cleaning and even removing water mineral buildup from stainless steel sinks.
I used this after the cake foaming cleanser. The powder didn’t come out as easily as expected, but once I rubbed it in, it left my toy clean and soft. The ingredients are simple (cornstarch), but considering the price, it feels a bit overpriced. Still, it works well.
This product feels a bit awkward to use, especially with my larger shower head. It’s helpful for my shower bench, but positioning the shower head in the holder can be challenging. It would work better with a smaller or medium-sized shower head.
It’s everything I needed.
Exactly as described. I recommend this seller.
These little bundles are adorable and smell amazing!
Love these and will definitely purchase again!
While they have a slight fishy odor, I’m happy with these vegetarian-friendly, organic, and non-GMO spirulina tablets. I take them daily for their health benefits. They’re easy on the stomach and don’t cause nausea or aftertaste, even when taken on an empty stomach.
I’m so glad I bought this! We make our own bubble solution, and this ingredient has saved us a lot of money compared to the store-bought versions. It works better too, and I even found a recipe for bubble bath to try. Highly recommend!
Make sure to check with your vet on how to properly use this product. I use it after a special shampoo once my dog dries. It helps with itching, and my vet recommends it. Don’t fault the product if you’re not using it correctly.
These are great for kids. The color stays vibrant, and the design is adorable.
These are beautiful and wash well by hand. Definitely recommend!
I found these CorneaCare Rescue Eye Cooling Pads very effective for dry and puffy eyes caused by allergies. I prefer cooling them in the fridge before use, and they provide great relief.
I bought these contact cases because of the design and the tools included, allowing me to see my contacts through the lid. However, to my surprise, they are not leak-proof!
These tennis shoes caused pain in my toes after long walks, especially my second toe. I’m overweight and initially thought it was due to that. However, I noticed the pain didn’t occur with other shoes. These insoles have worked well to alleviate the discomfort, and I’ll be more careful when purchasing my next pair of walking shoes.
I keep these in each room so I can turn off the lights without having to get up. It’s so convenient, especially when my hands are full.
This is exactly what I needed to compensate for my slight leg length discrepancy, as recommended by my doctor. It's perfect, and the shipping was incredibly fast. Very pleased with my purchase.
These gel inserts are a lifesaver for my foot problems, including heel spurs and plantar fasciitis. I avoid heels due to back issues, so flats are my go-to. I swap these inserts between different shoes, and they make a huge difference. At $5.99 for two pairs, it's a great deal.
I thought it would be like the one I had years ago, but it didn’t meet my expectations. While it worked to some extent, it wasn’t sticky and wasn't quite what I was hoping for, so I returned it.
I used this to clean outdoor furniture cushions, and it worked wonderfully. I plan to purchase it again.
The flavor is chocolatey but not like chocolate milk (which I dislike). It reminds me of the inside of a 3 Musketeers bar – thick, chocolatey, and satisfying. It's filling and can be thinned with water or milk, or blended with ice for a milkshake-like treat. It’s not low-calorie but offers a balanced nutritional profile, including vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It’s a great choice for a meal replacement, especially on days when I don’t feel like eating. Sweetened with allulose and sucralose, it’s very sweet without an aftertaste. It’s a versatile drink that’s easy to add to smoothies. I’m impressed and would definitely recommend it.
My kids are usually very picky, but they love these. They’re not overpowering in flavor, but they’re just tasty enough. The sugar-free aspect is a huge plus, and with health being so important, I’m happy with these probiotics.
Good product but the price is wrong – I found it for just 95 cents at Walmart.
These are of great quality and come with reinforcement rings to hold them securely against the brick pillars on our porch.
I really like the healthy delights chews. They’re a tasty alternative to pills, and they even seem to suppress my appetite a bit. I’ll definitely continue purchasing these.
My 7-year-old loves this! It has multiple settings and helps him brush his teeth for a full two minutes.
I believe this product is helping with the pressure in my eyes. I’ll continue using it.
The urn is of very good quality, with an easy-to-remove lid that stays secure. The map design is beautiful, though I’m confused about the alphabet across the top of the lid. I had hoped it would be perfect for my brother, a world traveler, but I’m not sure about the alphabet. Everything else is as described, though.
Excellent value for the price. I even gave some away to fellow travelers during a recent cruise.
These are not the 2.50 power reading glasses I expected. They’re missing the size on the arm and seem defective, with scratches and late delivery. Very disappointed with the quality control this time.
I didn’t realize this product would alter the structure of my soup, turning it into something like jello, which I didn’t like. At least the flavor remained unchanged!
I love this loofah! It’s especially great for getting rid of dry skin in the winter, and the length works well for me (I’m 5’8”). It would fit a shorter person too.
Not sure how well it cleans my teeth, but I love the taste of the Splashin’ Citrus. It’s very flavorful, and the natural ingredients like Bentonite and citrus make it enjoyable. The only downside is the frustration of trying to get the last bit of paste out of the plastic tube.
A lot of ribbon!
Very cooling and soothing, though almost too intense. It provides instant relief.
It does what it’s supposed to do.
It provides a good boost of energy without the jitters, lasting about 90 minutes.
I absolutely love them! I’ve ordered more and even gave some away. They arrived just as ordered, well-packaged, and have become an essential part of my daily routine due to my diabetes and upcoming gastric bypass surgery.
I wanted to like this, but it didn’t work for me. The elastic was heavy, and the Velcro closure was stiff and uncomfortable. It also snagged the fabric. The material was thin and not very absorbent. I wouldn’t recommend it, especially for post-shower warmth.
I keep these in my toolbox, around the shop, and in my truck. They’re handy for a variety of uses, hold a good edge, and can cut through materials like webbing, fabric, thin metal, and even wire.
I’m thrilled with the results from Jigsaw Health Magnesium wSRT. It’s lowered my blood pressure by 40 points and normalized my blood sugar levels. My doctor may take me off my prescription if these results continue.
Just what I was looking for. The extras are a nice touch, and the box appears to be well-made.
The product didn’t meet my expectations.
These are great for keeping pairs of socks together and reducing sorting time. They’ve held up well for about six months, so I’m happy with my purchase and even bought more.
It creates a foamy lather quickly, and the bristles are holding up well. The only issue is that the handle is a bit wide for my hands, but overall, I’m satisfied with the product.
The scent is perfect – better than Axe, and the reviews were spot on. It’s hard to go wrong with a brand that’s been around forever.
I’ve had trouble with various shoes in the past, but these inserts didn’t meet my needs. There were no guidelines for cutting them, and they felt stiff and rough. I wouldn’t purchase these again.
I got this for my 13-year-old grandson, and he carries it with him all the time.
Delicious and nutritious, these help me feel better while tasting great. The pineapple flavor is just the right balance – not too overpowering.
This is my fourth or fifth pair of sleep headphones, and these are by far the most comfortable. The eye padding and adjustable band are great. The sound quality is fine, though the speakers could be smaller. Overall, I love them, and the battery life is good too.
I didn’t notice any difference in stress relief with this product. I even tried it on my dog, but there was no effect. Maybe it’s just not strong enough for me, or perhaps I couldn’t feel a change due to my medications.
These arrived in fine condition, but the Tegaderm boxes were damaged, and they had a chemical smell. I was told that returns weren’t accepted, which was disappointing, especially since I needed them for medication patches.
These are great! The quality of the glass files is apparent, and I’m so glad I found them after trying several other brands.
This didn’t stay in place and was too large for me.
A great way to add antioxidants to your food. I prefer fresh, but since Acai berries aren’t easy to find, this is the next best thing. It’s versatile and easy to use in smoothies or yogurt.
Unfortunately, this flavor contains milk, which was disappointing. However, I will continue buying the COLD BREW COFFEE flavor, which tastes great and is dairy-free.
I couldn’t wait to write this review. I bought these gloves for my boyfriend, who needed them for psoriasis treatment at night. They fit perfectly and were very comfortable. The ointment stayed on his fingers and knuckles, providing relief. I’ll be buying more for sure!
Perfect for packing light.
This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used! My husband has severe psoriasis, and this product brings him relief. It’s thick but absorbs smoothly, leaving my skin soft all day.
These were too tight for me.
Best sleep aid I’ve tried.
I received this product around 4-5 days ago. The setup process was smooth, and connecting it to the network and tracker was easy. However, I am experiencing inconsistent results. Despite following all the steps correctly, such as placing it on a hard surface, keeping the location unchanged, and weighing myself with dry, bare feet, I still get varying results when I weigh myself multiple times in intervals of one minute. My weight fluctuates by 0.5 to 1 pound, and body fat percentages vary by 1%. Has anyone else encountered similar issues?
I enjoy trying different protein flavors to break away from the usual vanilla. The piña colada flavor has quickly become a new favorite. It strikes the perfect balance, not being too sweet or artificial. My preferred way to enjoy it is mixed with plain Greek yogurt. I blend in half to a full scoop and let it chill for a bit before eating. This way, it completely masks the taste of the whey powder, leaving a sweet and high-protein, low-sugar treat. It dissolves easily in both yogurt and milk for shakes. I didn’t experience any bloating or digestive discomfort. Highly recommended for anyone looking to try a new flavor!
It seems to be working well for my dry, brittle hair.
This product is fantastic! It’s very durable, and the blades are sharp enough to cut through effortlessly. A definite upgrade from the cheap, flimsy clippers I’ve used in the past.
A great aid post-foot surgery. Definitely makes a noticeable difference.
This first aid kit is excellent. It includes 250 items, which is more than enough to care for my family in the event of an accident. While I hope we never need it, it’s reassuring to know that it has everything, and then some. The kit is compact, well-organized, and easy to carry. It has a variety of supplies, making it suitable for many different scenarios. I’m glad I found and purchased this kit for my family. I bought it at a discounted price and am providing an honest review.
Works perfectly and is more affordable than similar products at Walmart.
Amazing product! Very satisfied with my purchase
Good quality product, but the mattress is a bit firmer than I prefer, so I’ll be returning it.
Adheres well even on greasy surfaces.
Part of my daily routine for knee pain relief, just as expected.
Fits perfectly, and it’s heat-resistant—no issues handling hot items.
This case is a clever design. It includes dividers to keep items separated, which prevents jewelry like chains and earrings from tangling. However, the thickness from the dividers is noticeable. It’s well-made, but I think someone will soon create a more compact organizer that still keeps items separate. I also wish it came in more vibrant colors—something like neon green would make it easier to spot in a hotel safe or on a dresser. I rely on reviews for smart purchases and aim to help others with my feedback. If this was helpful, let me know by voting. Thanks!
All formulas are easy to use. Unlike other pens, these aren’t overnight ones, so you’ll need to time and remember when you start. While the results aren’t dramatic, they are noticeable, which is still great.
Very soft and holds up well through multiple washes.
This product is a lifesaver. I used to spend $100 on acupressure spa visits for neck pain relief. After using this for the first time, I was nearly brought to tears because it felt so effective. It targets sore spots precisely, and the heat feature adds extra comfort. My only minor suggestion would be for the handles to be loops for easier adjustment between neck and back areas. The construction is excellent, with solid stitching and a pleasant red glow. For the price, it’s an incredible value and has significantly reduced my neck pain. I use it before bed, and my neck feels much better in the morning. I just wish I had purchased this sooner.
This product is large but stands well on its own. It has colorful lights that you can turn off while sleeping, and it offers multiple air cleaning levels. It seems to work well and is easy to clean.
This stain remover is unique, with a deodorant-stick style applicator. I’ve used it on paint and fruit stains with great results. It’s easy to apply, just rub it on, let it sit for 15 minutes, and then wash. The scent is fresh but not overpowering, and it’s great for sensitive skin. I appreciate that it’s biodegradable and chemical-free.
I use this product after removing my makeup, with a rechargeable facial tool. It’s gentle, has a clean scent, and doesn’t strip my skin of natural oils. Great value for the price.
I use this product daily.
It has a lovely scent and is safe for my son, who suffers from severe eczema. People often compliment the smell of our clothes, thanks to this product and the dryer spray from Method.
This is a fantastic product!
Perfect for the baby!
Other brands, especially the menthol ones, are harsh and have a burning effect. 4-Way, however, works much better, acting quickly and with minimal rebound. It’s superior to other brands, like the popular one with oxymetazoline HCL. Always check your labels!
This product includes numerous tiny brushes.
