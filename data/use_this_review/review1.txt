I really can't tell any difference and it is noisy. I bought it for litter box smell. I really cannot tell any difference.
I use this along with two other ways to help naturally treat my sons {11} ADHD. 10 drops in the OJ in the morning mixed with two other things brings my kid way down. Enough to focus at school without Adderal. I have tried many things for years and finally have the combo he needs. This was recommended to us by my sons new holistic DR.
I bought this product but it did not fit my massage table. The return policy said it could be returned or replaced. However, I tried returning and it says not returnable. I am now stuck with pricey, unusable pad.
Arrived crammed into a box about the size containing 20 bags of tea. To cram it in there the tubing is bent and kinked. Bent rubber cracked and will not hold air. Returned.
I have nasal issues, and like my mother, boxes of tissue in every room and car.  I don’t have cup holders in my car, but these would work perfectly there.  They are not super soft and thick but not thin and rough either, so they’re fine.  My only recommendation is to look at the diagram on Amazon on how to open it up, I didn’t and ripped off the top, I taped it back together tougher and the canister works great, one coming out after one is pulled up and out very easily.
Works great. Since they do you might ask yourself why do you need five. Case is great
Did not have nearly the amount of shoulder correction I was looking for. Provides basic lower back support, same as a wrap support would, and a slight pull-back for the shoulders, but not that much.
ok but not all that powerfull like the old wahl i had
The bath bombs all look and smell the same. They are fairly large--about the size of medium oranges. Not gift quality IMO as the box doesn't scream luxury--rather it says utility. Plus it has a wide plastic wrap around it. There's a bar code label firmly stuck on the box which says 'made in china.' I was unable to remove it without tearing the box. So again, an argument against gifting.The bombs are individually wrapped and are strong smelling. Just all the same which is a great pity. There is a tiny variation in colour due to to the swirls, but that's it.Bath bombs have become fancy these days and so these don't compare well. They fizzed and floated for a while and kids love that, but other than that, nothing special. Overall the smell was too strong.
This is an amazing keto supplement. Helps burn fat fast. Great price
I purchased based on Serios Keto review on U-tube.  Ugg! They taste horrible.  I love the carmel collagen powder, so I’m disappointed these are so bad.
Love this product! Works just like it says it will, awesome.
Works better than anything
I’d been using Burt’s Bees drops, saw these, and thought to try them.Bad idea.Bad taste.Bad texture.In addition – they’re far too pricey.Not something I’d get again or recommend.
These are very cute and very well made socks!
Wouldn’t Spend more the. $10 on this. Malfunctions after first use.
Nothing but love
~BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER.HARD TO FIND WHITENING AS WELL AS CLEAN MINT.FAST DELIVERY~
Just okay. For dusting, probably good. For actually cleaning the floor, not so much.
I just received my first order of JUNP and I'm so excited to have found it!  My uncle, who works in the medical field, recommended it to me.  After being a long-time Liquid IV user, I  was looking for something less expensive but just as good.  I'm really pleased to see that JUNP contains even more variety and quantity of necessary electrolytes than the Liquid IV product.  I also like the "texture" of the JUNP in my water better.  JUMP is less sweet, but just as delicious, and I love that it comes in a small canister that is easy to store...it doesn't crowd my pantry.We go through a LOT of electrolyte mix around here with 2 high school athletes!  My husband and I are also in our 40s and have to be more conscious of our nutrition, and the JUNP will help us with natural hydration and energy so we can avoid caffeinated sodas.
One tabet is supposed to last 30 days not true 1 tab lasts 2 weeks I live alone and have marked the calendar to make sure I was correct, disappointing.
They smell amazing however you would probably need 20 of them to be able to consistently smell them. Here and there it will be noticeable, but it’s amazing when it is.
This product is amazing And I wouldn’t be without it now.
I prefer my battery operated warming socks in frigid WI.  Sorry : (
Now I can get the whole first floor windows done. The building is very tall so the second and third are out of the question but the main floor looks good :)
SelectSocial CBD products are great. They are third party tested for accuracy. And the little extras like the herbals in their capsules are a nice added bonus.
Great product. They really help relieve pain in heels. However placement is everything. If not done correctly it will be a mess.
My Air filter systems UV light system burned out...bought this, and plugged in right next to my air filter.  Working Great!
This is a great comparison to Johnson and Johnson brand
Helping with tummy issues. Using with Oregano oil, too.
DMSO is good stuff. It helped to defeat carpal tunnel syndrome in my wrists, and arthritic shoulders and knees. absolutely amazing.
Great for long flights. Worked great. I would suggest wearing another pair of normal sock over because these are thin and have no cushion.
only 90 minutes run time...needed hours
I have Endometriosis and have terrible cramps and vaginal pain during my cycle. A friend in my support group recommended to give these a try so I bought them. They are wonderful! They don’t fully make cramps go away but they do ease them especially the vaginal pain. They smell very nice but are lightly dented. I’m very sensitive and they have not given me any issues. The cooling feeling was a bit more than I expected when I first used them but it is very refreshing and great for pain. I also have a few of their cleansing products and I love everything I have tried from honey pot!
I have been taking Carnitine capsules to help with Fibro pain.  Let's see how these worked.HOW THESE COMEThese come in an orange plastic bottle with an orange childproof cap.  The pills inside are pressed white powder.ARE THEY HARD TO SWALLOW?These tablets are a bit on the long side, but they are not too big to swallow, if you are sure to have a lot of water in your mouth.ANY BAD REACTIONS?I have not had any burping, or bad digestive reactions to these.DO THEY HELP?I find that taking these does help with fibro pain and energy about as well as the powder in gel caps that I normally take.  They do help take a bit of the edge off of the pain.THE BOTTOM LINEThese tablets are not the same as the powder in capsules I usually take but they seem to work as well to help with fibro pain and energy levels.  The orange bottle is great to help me find it quickly.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  I am glad that I got these.  I was not sure when I first saw them, but after taking them, I think they work pretty well.
Great bag for the money durable. I highly reccomend
Very good product. The handle is good quality and makes using the pumice stone very easy.
It works well, glad I got it. The jets work nicely. I like the option of high jets or lower yet. Easy to instal. The suction cups hod the jets we'll
Love these for making candies mainly I just make organic gummy candy's for a treat they work well and the shapes are awesome. Also can use for jello
This brush is probably the easiest way to straighten your hair....I have very long, very thick hair, and anything else has been a pain in the butt to use.  This has made it very, very easy! I highly recommend it!
Hate, hate, hate. These are impossibly thin. And for someone like me, with large calves, it is a real pain to try to get them on. I returned for a full refund.
Absolutely love the PowerDot and the wireless, Bluetooth capabilities. As an athlete I can take this anywhere and use it at any time without worrying about having to hold the main component. Its easy to pack, transport and use anywhere. It’s a high quality product that I would recommend to anyone of any level for any reason.
Discourages mosquitoes and can be safely used every day.  I use the original spray Skin So Soft if I'm going to be outside working.
Works like Comet should!
But it's actually a good mixture of soft, but not linty, and no chemicals to irritate my bum. The price from some vendors varies greatly so watch out for that.
I've been taking Lion's Mane Mushroom powder for about 2 months solid and find that it has basically no flavor at all. I put it in my coffee or a turmeric tea, it mixes in well and it's easy to drink. I've done a some research on it and it seems to be a very good supplement and highly beneficial for good health. Here are some the benefits it has:- Enhanced brain functioning- Ability to prevent or slow the growth of cancer- Supports heart health- Helps with depression and anxiety- Potent antioxidant- Reduces inflammation- Boosts immune system- Supports digestive healthThe only side effect I've been able to find is that it might cause a slight skin rash with some minor itching but is very rare and not considered serious, just irritating. I think this is a very good lion's mane supplement.
I love this scale very much. it syncs right away with my phone and fitbit app. The only funny thing is i have to weigh 3 times to get a very accurate reading. Well worth it to me. My daughter uses it also and I love how you can choose the initials of the person so it syncs to the right person. I love it... The batteries that came with it had a very short shelf life so be prepared to replace them right away. the new batteries are going strong. I also noticed it doesn't like really cold floors. not sure why, but that is what it seems like to me.
Healthy, soy-free, dairy-free protein? Awesome. I use it in meal-replacement shakes with cocoa powder, a little sugar, and sometimes peanut butter powder or powdered heavy cream. And the price is better than I expected.
Worked ok for 3 months and stopped working. I try to contact the seller. Will update soon.UPDATE. 4TH NOVEMBER. SELLER STILL NOT RESPONDING!!!!!
I did not expect them to be of such nice quality. I bought about 40 of them in total to give as gifts to those who take my Face Fitness class.
As you would expect. Works great for stirring
These are listed as one size fits most. My thoughts on that were that that meant fits a lot of different sizes. Not. I wear a 14 and there way no way these were going on. I gave them to my oldest daughter, who wears an 8, and they barely fit. Not only were they difficult for her to get on in the first place, they kept sliding down, over time. The waistband doesn't hold them up very good and, with the thighs being so extremely tight, they kept wanting to work their way down. To be fair, they seem nice and warm. However, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone over a size 8 (AT MAX!) or, probably, under a size 6(?) maybe a 4 (?). Not my idea of "one size fits most".1 star - Awful! Want my money back!2 stars - Bad but not horrendous.3 stars - DecentGood4 stars - Really good!5 stars - Excellent! Definitely recommend!
I really like the quality of these gua sha pink stones from this particular company. It's polished and smooth, and I haven't received a nicked or damaged one yet. It feels great after you've left it overnight in the fridge. Overall I like the presentation and quality very much. Recommended.
After only one night of two doses, this product has helped me with my asthma, coughing and excess mucus.  I was also able to fall back to sleep immediately. I will be ordering another one very soon! I am shocked  and thrilled that I found something that actually works,  has no flavor and no horrible side effects!Ingredients: Active Ingredients HPUS:Eriodictyon californicum 8X (Yerba santa)Ipecacuanha 8X (Ipecac)Lobelia inflata 8X (Indian tobacco)Chamomilla 8X (German chamomile)Belladonna 8X (Deadly nightshade)Coffea cruda 8X (Coffee)Solidago virgaurea 8X (Goldenrod)Sambucus nigra 8X (European elder)Crataegus 8X (Hawthorn)
very comfortable.. and for the ridiculously LOW price, not falling apart after a month or two.i will easily by more of these when i DO break ones i have, or wife takes them.come with slim cases and glass retainer cords.almost 5 star, really, for the price and quality so far.. but, i reserve 5 star for "perfect" items.. ;-)
This is a nice basket of bath bombs. The basket itself is a decent quality. The bath bombs are a little smaller than I expected, but they seem to "explode" slowly so you can relish the experience for a moment or two. The bombs are individually wrapped in plastic which has been a little difficult to open. The first bomb that I used, said it was grapefruit, but didn't smell anything like the fruit. It had more of a flowery perfume scent. The next one that I used was the peppermint one and it did smell like peppermint so I don't know if the grapefruit one was mislabeled or not. The bombs haven't left any noticeable rings in the tub. This would make a great gift!
Excellent. These are lasting well over a year. The battery life is phenomenal. 7-heads is the best configuration for in-shower, bald facepate shaving.7-heads are excellent. Every bit the equal of my >5x more expensive foil shaver.As a note, I used a shaving creamconditioner provided by the hotel on the road some months ago and not this shaver. The hotel cream was too thick and stalled the razor. It was a bear to cleanout. It was the first time I ever had to pop the individual shaving heads ... I'd suggest you avoid this if you have big hands. Since then, I've stuck to my tried and true shaving cream that enables a close shave and easy flush cream.
This is a nice idea and concept, but the execution doesn’t work for many faces. This ended up putting a lot of pressure on the bridge of my nose, which isn’t particularly huge or anything, but this definitely is made for people with tiny noses with a very small or low bridge. If that’s not you, you’re not gonna like this. Very uncomfortable, and the little hook bracket things don’t connect to anything, so they don’t stay in place.
Love this shoe horn.  I'm short with a bad spine.  The reach is totally adjustable.. works great
This was my first time trying chlorella powder and it will likely be my last. The smell alone turned my stomach. I tried to drink it, but the flavor is strong. I felt like I was drinking dirty water frogs had been splashing around in. (I'm sure the green color added to that mental picture.) The powder is super powdery, so be careful opening the package. I used an immersion blender to get it mixed up. It seems like a nice product IF you like the taste and scent. I'm unable to bear it, though.
This is a FANTASTIC set of blends for essential oil newbies. I have been dabbling in essential oils for aromatherapy, application, and cleaning purposes for a almost a year now and I've been pleasantly surprised with how much I like them. I'm a big fan of diffusing them to help with &quot;ailments&quot; and I think this set of blends is an amazing deal for a great set.What I like:1) This includes all of the most common oil blends that you can make if you have all of the individual oils. Stress Relief, Sleepytime, Headache remedy, breathe better, health shield (immune booster), and muscle relief. There are lots of mixtures you can do depending on the issue you are addressing, but these have been the most common (other than muscle relief) that we have used in our house.2) The sizes of the bottles are great. Its more than enough to last you a while, as you only need a few drops in your diffuser.3) They are already pre-mixed in the correct amounts. No guesswork, no worrying if you have enough of one oil or not enough of another, and you can always add a couple more drops of whatever you want to make this more customizable ( if you want to add slightly more eucalyptus or peppermint to the diffuser when you use &quot;Breathe,&quot; for instance)4) Dark amber glass bottles and heavy duty caps to keep the oils safe.5) Comes in a really nice box, so this would be perfect to give as a gift.What I don't like:I honestly haven't come across anything yet. All of the ones I've tried have been helpful and they smell exactly like the blends I had been doing.Overall, I'm glad I gave this set a try and I will definitely be buying my mother a set since shes just starting out with essential oils. I think this set is super convenient and well priced for what you get. I'm very happy with it!**I did receive this item for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing it, but my cost has no bearing on how I rate a product.**
Started using March 25, 2015 so don't know how it is working yet.
I love these aromatic steamer shower bombs! They are vividly colored, appropriately sized, delightfully scented, and affordably priced, and they always provide an invigorating shower experience! Each disk comes individually wrapped, and the entire set is attractively packaged, but I will say that any other scented products I use at the same time as these overpower the fragrant scent of these bombs (simply because body washes and shampoos are closer to my nose). The air is scented strongly for up to about 3 feet above each bomb, and they dissolve cleanly without staining surfaces, so I’d still recommend this boxed dozen to others!
My husband is very pleased with this trimmer. The price was what helped him decide to give this a try. He loves a good deal. He recommends this beard trimmer.
Arrived on time, item as described.
Great trimmer that worked well in shower. I still prefer a razor blade for a much closer shave.
Comfortable fit but not much help with sweating under the mask
I was pleased at first but now I am not.  NO matter how long I leave my contacts in, my eyes burn from this solution..  Even after I rinsed my lenses with saline solution they still burned my eyes.  SO I stopped using this and went back to Bausch and Lomb Bio True lens solution!
First floss I've found that glides easily between my tightly-spaced teeth.  I'm very happy with this product.
Works great as advertised.
Very nice, can't wait to finish my current journal to get to use this one!
If you have a husband who snores and keeps you awake at night I would suggest you buy these. I don’t know how I have lived so long without these.
I can't take a lot of supplements due to the ingredients which end up doing more harm than good. I took these (and taking these) and have had zero problems. As for benefits, I can't say that I've noted any (unlike PQQ).Resveratrol has many health benefits and I was happy to give it a try. We are all different, perhaps others noticed a difference.This is made in the USA and GMP certified (I always look for that). This is a vegan capsule which is great. I don't get the addition of lemongrass but perhaps I'm missing something...There are 60 capsules here but the recommended dose is 2 per day so in reality this is a 30 days supply.
Decent for the price
I've been battling Vitamin D deficiency ever since I can remember and this supplement has been helping me a lot. This deficiency greatly affects my blood sugar levels, so I make it a point to religiously take this supplement. I have been getting decent numbers when my doctor orders complete blood panel tests - which goes to show that this supplement is doing its job!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customerend user’s standpoint.
I was skeptical when I bought this razor due to the price...BUT, after using it for a couple of weeks, I can say that I really like this razor. Don't let the price fool you. The battery life is also very good. My last razor would have to be recharged weekly. Not this one. It arrived with 100% battery and I've yet to charge it and I still have plenty of battery left. I'd buy it again in a heart-beat.
No complaints at all about these generic replacement heads for a Sonicare. They fit well on my Sonicare -- not so tight that they are difficult to get on or off, and not so loose that they come off too easily. The fit is pretty much the same as the authentic Sonicare brushes.Although these are described as being soft, I would rate the bristles as medium (or perhaps mediumsoft). The bristles are definitely harder than the Sonicare Ultra Soft version, but are not as hard as the Sonicare regular brushes. I would have preferred that they be just a tad softer than they are, but they are not so hard as to cause any notable gum irritation. The oblong head shape is good for getting at the gum line and reaching molars.The set of 8 come in a single box, with each brush individually sealed in a plastic pouch. Plus, there's a cap over the end of each brush. I much prefer this type of packaging versus the blister pack method used by other generic replacement heads. It's easier to deal with and creates less packaging waste.No significant complaints about these -- good value for the price.
Woks great at lowering blood pressure and is reasonable priced!
Lovely, I ordered it because it reminds me of those Tibetan Temple wheels.
Nice unit but you can only set both leads to the same strength.  So if you have them in different locations they are still the same strength on both lines
Very portable and easy for on the go! This pump worked extremely well for me, easy to clean, put together, and charger! Great value for the price I used it while my little one was in the nicu and liked it better than the hospital pump. Definitely worth the buy!!!
This is a 7 oz bag of USDA Certified Organic maca root. It looks and smells like I expected. It smells and tastes pretty fresh to me.
This did not clean my teeth better than my electric toothbrush. I can feel it. Alas, I still gave it a few days and nights to see how my teeth feel.I will be sticking with the electric brush as the bristles can actually get in between my teeth. This is a dense brush and I can see why they call it the cloud toothbrush on instagramFB. It is really soft, so for those with very sensitive gums, try this. It's worth checking out to see if it helps you.I also felt kind of nasty thinking about how I'd get this completely clean if I continue using it for the full amount of time, as it seems food could easily get trapped in the dense bristles. It does have a textured back which I assume to be a tongue cleaner, however it's useless. Each brush is in it's own container with breathing holes, however those are also very flimsy so if you get this knowing you'll love it, I would grab a toothbrush case separately.Basically felt like I was brushing with a sponge.
Charge lasts forever! Fast Heating.Absolutely the best I have ever owned even comparing to others twice the cost.
this is made of plastic, and does not hold suction.  Bad product.
Great product and good price.
We have used this for all three of our children from birth to when they get out of diapers.. it’s so gentle, easy to apply and works fast!
I have a lot of low backhip pain, and after a day of sitting at the computer all day kills me. I can't afford a fancy ergonomic office chair, so I was ecstatic to see this show up. I've been using it for a couple weeks now, and I'm amazed that I feel as good or better at the end of the day as I do when I start working. It conforms easily to my back while still providing excellent support. It's not overly molded so that it only fits one body typeshape. The unique design of the rubber stays firm when and where needed but is soft and cushy where needed too.One thing to note is that the cover is a stretchy fabric like spandex which allows it to stretch over the cushion but fit closely to it. There are two loops on the back which allow you to run a belt or rope to tie it in place onto your chair. However, since the fabric is so stretchy and the cushion fairly heavy, it pulls down into the seat rather than staying against the chair back, so I still have to push it up and into place when I come back to the chair. I'm thinking of sewing a more structured cover that won't stretch so much to keep it in place better.I received a discount in exchange for an honest review.
It cleans
This is just the thing to have on hand. With the whole COVID outbreak this is the kind of supplement that you don’t need until you really need it. I like that it has elderberry, vitamins and b in addition to the standard vitamin c.
I love the massive amount of time turmeric in these capsules! Turmeric is a wonderful, all natural, anti-inflammatory, joint pain fighting machine! Most brands that I’ve looked at have under 1000 mg per serving. But I was looking for a product that packed a bit more of a punch and this product was the winner! Each serving of 3 veggie capsules contains over 2000 mg of turmeric as well as black pepper for maximum absorption. It’s organic and each bottle contains a months worth of capsules.
For the past 10 years, this is the easiest way I've found to give calcium to my 30 lb dog to supplement her home made diet. I use it with an "oral syringe": . I load it up every 10 days, squirt 1 ml into her dinner every night, that's it, no fuss no muss.  No refrigeration needed. Best of all, her bloodwork is always just about perfect. Being a product for humans, I can worry less about impurities that eggshells or pet-only products might have.I had a whole lot of trouble finding this for a while. My local pharmacy stopped carrying it because they couldn't get it. I couldn't find it anywhere online. In the meantime I tried a different calcium solution. It didn't have nearly the concentration and was very sticky. It meant giving my dog even more sorbate. That's not nearly as bad for them as xylitol, but it's always wise to keep artificial sweeteners to an absolute minimum for dogs. I ended up throwing it all out the minute I could restock on the Roxane version. Seems that Roxane had to recertify it or something? Anyway, it's still hard to find and I am very glad to have found it here.
It’s  best to have extra magnetic clips for your CPAP straps. Good buy!
Decent brush - I use diesel to clean and gear oil to lube.  I had plans of using one brush for the cleaning and one for the lubing.  Then when I went to lube chain, I found I was too lazy to get up and grab the second brush...so I use the same brush for cleaning and lubing.  Holding up so far.
This is the best product for cleaning the soap from our shower stall. With a wipe of a paper towel it it clean and shiny! I now have a never ending supply!
Fantastic-easy to use
These cod livers are sooo good.  I couldn't wait try them and they didn't disappoint.Next to lobster tails, I've never tasted anything so GOOD in my life!EDIT: 12282019I'm taking OFF 2 stars for the SMASHED UP CANS YOU KEEP SENDING ME!
This massager works great, digs in to those big knots on the shoulders.  I am enjoying sitting and relaxing while the massager and heat  works its magic!
This product worked great. I would highly recommend.
This is the first diffuser I've purchased and it does not disappoint.  The fragrance is powerful yet not overwhelming. It has a clean, soft scent and I can smell it throughout my room. This makes an excellent gift for men or women. I'll be buying more, this Soleil scent is hard to find.
These are the best. Removed mildew from golf cart seat! Scratch off basement wall. You name it!
You will find that as you get older, your eyesight needs help to maintain your vision. I have degenerative retinal disease and I take Vision Support to keep my eyes from getting worse. I have taken other brand names of the same formulation and so far, my disease has not gotten worse in the five or six years since being diagnosed. If you are diabetic, this is imperative to keep from getting diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and cataracts.
If you need to make an adapter of your own this will let you do it.  It's nice to have on hand, just in case.
Always have loved scrub buds.Better priced than other sellers.
They are thin. I have order pads before but these are not the ones.
good taste, no problems with it
It is nice to be able to get the supplies I need without making many phone calls or wait for representive to bring to me. Very nice product, thanks.
Helped me a great deal! Thank you!
I love this brand. They are able to source products that are tested And backed by clinical studies so I know what I’m getting. This product gave me the feeling of being alert and Focused without the jitters and I felt like o had control of my thoughts. Took about an hour for me to even realize because it’s just that subtle and smooth.
I have taken 1 to 2 grams of omega 3 every day for the past two decades.  My reasoning for taking the supplement varies with my ailments and the research.  It has been shown to be useful for mental health, inflammatory disease, muscle strength, and cancer prevention.  I used to take it for my heart and memory but I'm not sure the science supports that.  I take one pill a day to supplement the large quantities of fish oil I get from fresh caught fish that we eat every other day.I chose this brand because of Consumer Labs' recommendations based on formulation, concentration, quality and price.  Not only is it one of the most concentrated capsule form, but buying it in this two pack with an additional discount cut the price to $.14 a pill making it the cheapest omega 3 per 500 mg.
We use in our apartment bedroom, for great sleep
Great value and a lot of sounds to choose from. Doesn't seem to loop either
I thought this would be a great set, and I'm always looking for good clippers so I ordered this set.Straight out of the package the case was very sticky.  I used a lens wipe to clean it off and it worked admirably, but...I shouldn't have to.There is quite a lot in this set, but the nail clippers (the standard on how I judge a nail care set) both left my nails a little rough and frayed after using. The nail file was fine, but the other tools seemed a little rough. I wouldn't necessarily want them going under my nails or pushing back my cuticles...The "ear digging" tools (description made me laugh) are self contained in a little tube with a screw on top. That is nice that you can isolate them.The heavy duty toenail clippers was the best of the lot. They worked well and didn't leave my toenails jagged.So, this is a cheap quality, functional nail maintenance set. There are better ones out there for a better price (I know, I have a couple). I wouldn't choose this set again, and I wouldn't feel comfortable giving as a gift. I'd give it away but not as a gift if that makes sense.
This is a great interim product for in between chiropractic adjustments.
Perfect for my grandson’s 1st Birthday!
Works for sore muscles as well as face roller.
Works good but there's cheaper products that do the same.
As advertised
Saved me money by salvaging the waterpik that I currently have (over buying a new one). Seems to have similar design flaws as the original, like the water doesn’t all come out, which harbors a moist environment that mildew and mold love. The quality isn’t as high, though, the hinge to the door broke on one side and snapped off on the other side. The door can still seal the hole, but it’s now a separate piece. Still usable but not ideal as I almost lost the door down the drain.
Really helped with tension in my shoulders!
I blend with plain yogurt, works well
Looks like a 2nd hand item that I'd buy at a thrift shop or a dollar store.
My sixteen year old suffers from neck and collarbone pain due to a sports injury. This helps him to relieve pain and relax the muscles in his neck. He can lay on this a few minutes at a time a few times a day and it helps tremendously. It's a thick curved pillow that looks uncomfortable but in reality it's the opposite. It steadys his neck and stretches the muscles. Great value
Shiny black jasper with Archangel sigils for Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel as in pictured and described. I wanted these to use for my healing work and they are exactly what I wanted.
Feels good in your hand and is light weight, but squeaks very badly on shower doors and does not make a clean sweep of the glass.  Is not worth the price they are asking.  Streeks really bad also if your lucky enough to actually get the water off the glass.
The foam is much easier to clean..!!
This is not noisy at all, another person stated it was "very noisy". It makes a little hum, soothing really my baby falls fast asleep while it's on. I have this in our bed room, and I enjoy it. The air smells cleaner and our house is brand new and very clean but it just seems fresher. I am buying another for my other child's room I love it so much. We own a rental and I even put them in the home to rid the other people's smell of dog and so on. The bulb last 4000 hours and should be replaced if not out by then to insure it's doing its job. If I was rich I would buy for every room at once, but I'm not so I buy one at a time.Side note***this is awesome next to a diaper pale or trash can!
Excellent organic essential oil at a very good price.
Item as described. Would do business with again.
I have used this product for years as a supplement to my diet and my active lifestyle.  Unfortunately, it is not vegan so I had to stop using it.  If your are not vegan I suggest you try Fruitein before other similar products.
Won’t but again … teeth on flat iron  get caught in my hair . I had clip them off this wire cutters
Smells great and keeps my mat from getting funky. Love the little towel too, it was nice to not have to sacrifice one from my linen closer to keep in yoga bag.
Good news, these do stick on Hersey's kisses for days.  Buy them, you get a lot.  I used them for the rehearsal dinner (sweet) and the wedding.Great price.Went with the burlap theme
Very disappointed.The temperature on the screen was wrong, and the brush just made my hair frizzy and unmanageable. I would like a refund.
Not great compression. Unfortunately I wasn't able to return these, so I'm stuck with them now. I wouldn't purchase them if you need tighter (20-30mmhg) compression as they fit more like sort of snug socks.
I've never tried a protein drink that's basically a shot. It's a novel concept that I enjoy very much. The bottle is small enough to fit in a bag to take on the go. You can drink it alone or add it to other liquids. The flavor is pleasant. There are artificial flavors if you're trying to avoid them. Otherwise, this is a good product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
I chose this curling brush because I read ceramic tourmaline is for thinner, fine hair like I have. It produced nice curls and my hair stayed curly a little longer than usual but I didnt see anything much different than other curling brushes.I had quite a difficult time learning how to curl my hair without a clip. I guess the no clip is for curls to look more natural.I think it is a misprint that it is on sale from $149 as it states.It did the job of curling my hair but it didnt go above and beyond regular curlers
Great size to carry with me
The only thing that works for sore, swollen feet!  I've used it for years and now I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT while pregnant.  Nothing else even comes close
This the Wright size for everyone
Just okay.  Serve their purpose.
I can't explain how many different places  companies I've tried this is good if you shift around and like to shake your booty some people say it collapses yeah it does but I don't know it's a good option if you move in your seat and want a little refreshment
I don’t know what planet you guys are on but this is the worst car cleaner ever it leaves a white residue that’s almost impossible to get off even if you rub it immediately after you put it on. I’m returning it whatever you do do not buy this product
Absolutely love puffs plus tissue. Don’t run out auto delivery!!! Especially this time of year can’t beat this deal!!
Great balloon that literally stayed filled for weeks!!! Large and beautiful, perfect for any birthday or occasion.
I really like this! Got this for my 7 year old son! He loves the taste!! Great quality! Contains organic vitamins and minerals! Definitely YES!!!
Used this soap the day that I received it.  Haven't a negative thing to say about this product.  It is just exactly described justas it is.  Very hard in the container and looks as though it's been poured in,  while it was hot.  Very rustic looking in the plasticcontainer,  as it is supposed to look.You can tell that some serious work went into the making of this soap,  by its performance.  After running hot water into thebowl and using a fine shaving soap brush,  you will get a very rich creamy good smelling lather.  You will get a close shavewith minimal nicks and irritation.Another fine point is,  you will enjoy a unique old time barbershop scent while shaving.  An important point is,  this soap isin line with other brands of shaving soaps according to price.  You cannot order a good quality can of shaving soap for lessthat 15 dollars.  This shaving soap is somewhat a cut above your average shaving soap on the market today.  Therefore,  Ican comfortably say that this shaving soap is a fair price for the quality that it  factually is.It appears that you will able to get months of shaving from this reasonably large can of shaving soap.  The container is not a cheapplastic,  it is a heavy duty plastic jar with a screw on lid that fits precision and will screw on tightly to keep your soap fresh.This container will not allow your soap to dry out.  All in all,  I cannot find fault with this product or the seller...
Up until recently, it's been hard to find good vegan sources of D3. This is a powerful source of veggie D3 that packs double the punch of my usual supplies of vitamin D3. Usually, I find 5,000 IU to be the standard. I've read varying opinions about 5k+, and have heard that the body doesn't absorb larger amounts as well as 2k or smaller. The National Academy of Medicine lists the upper daily limit at 4,000 IU, though doses up to 10,000 IU have been found NOT to cause toxicity in healthy humans. For this reason, I won't be taking daily mega-doses of vitamin D. I will take these capsules once or twice a week in supplement to my daily multivitamin, which contains 100% of my daily supply of vitamin D. I like taking more, especially during the winter, as my health insurance does not approve vitamin D tests in healthy individuals my age.All that said, this is a good quality mushroom-based source of vitamin D3, formulated by a former Cleveland Clinic doctor. Recommended, and long-lasting if one takes once or twice a week as a supplement to daily multivitamins! I'm set for a year or two!
The glue tabs are not going to hold this.  I used pins eventually after having it fall down several times.  It does require some slight assembly as the letters are not all connected like it appears in the picture and do not come on the ribbon.  Not really a big deal though.
Works well.
Excellent product and your service too!
This works well, just small, so it requires more uses to get a head of hair curled. I wouldn't recommend for long hair
Fish burps in the morning.Fish burps in the evening.Fish burps at supper time.With fish burps in a bottle, you can have fish burps any time.
Turmeric is good for digestion, cholesterol, anti-inflammatory  and possibly diabetes. This one comes as a pure powder. Turmeric also has manganese and iron, which is good for your blood and your bones. The powder form is easy to use. Use it as a spice to your dishes or use it in smoothies.
Great product and fast delivery. Look forward to next time
I have tried so many sleep masks over the years, and this is in my top ten.  It's comfortable and easy to wear.  The strap is adjustable and it isn't bulky under my head when I'm sleeping on my back.  It washed well in a lingerie bag and hung up to air dry.  The material and foam are both soft against the skin.  I have long lashes and masks usually rub against them and drive me nuts, but this stands far enough away from my eyes that it doesn't bother me.  These work really well for blocking out all light.  A+++
Does the job, but the caps on the large bottles don't always go on correctly---they don't seem to line up right and have sipped off when I didn't triple-check to make sure it had latched.  This doesn't to be a problem with the smaller ones, so I guess it was something off-specification in the manufacturing of the larger ones.
Spend...but worth the Bucks! Really does a fabulous job if you follow the directions.
I use this product per dr recommendation to treat corneal edema, so when I don’t use this type of product, my eyes get very blurry. I will agree with other reviewers, this product is thicker and gloopier than competitors, however, in all the brands I have tried, I have never found one that keeps my eues clearer. I am really happy to have found this! No, it may not be the easiestmost comfortable to apply, but for me, it works!
This probiotic was recommended by my ocupancturist to promote my immune system two years ago. I have been taking one a day and it has been working very well for me. When I get a cold it won't last a long time.
Love the smell. Not sweet and cloying like some others. Also, keeps bugs away. Had an ant problem at one apartment, used this around any sweet drink, no more ants in my tea or soda. No more ants on my tables. Around the windows and doors, they stopped coming in. All the bugs stayed away.
I like the size. There is a large handle and a large compartment for collecting the lint.
In this day and age of excessive hand washing - I HAD to have some of these to save my poor, cracked over washed hands - still have to do the dishes.  They are extra long.  I consider myself to have a medium size hand and they are snug - but not too.  Comes with a set of 3 in 3 different colors -- that happen to work for spring right now - but who really cares.  My hands are grateful.
Loved the price and product
My feet are horrendous. It’s genetic and also I wear a lot of flops or go barefoot all the time so callouses are just a normal thing for me. I get a pedicure once a month and even that never did much. What I actually do it use the blade shaver and shave most of the big callouses off and then use this to smooth it all down. My feet aren’t baby soft, but they’re no longer rough. I love that they send you so many extra sand paper discs. I do my feet like once a week and I’m no where near halfway done and I’ve had this thing for months now. I do have to us one disc for each foot because of the amount of callousing all over my feet, but the end result is great. I then lotion my feet up and the next day they are nice and smooth. Totally worth the money!
This suction cup really sticks!!!  It is very strong and holds the shower so I can sit and wash my hair.
I love these little lanyards to keep up with my masks, they are always handy and it helpsKeeping them clean.
When I got it the seal was open I’m pretty sure it’s fine other than that I love it!
i drink a lot of coffee so decided on buying this. i did not notice any difference on my teeth ..will say since i have sensitive teeth worked out great on that point. but did not see whitening effect using this.
Great product.  I was always so cold and the space heater made the air dry but it was never warm enough to work without a coat and gloves on.  With the heater on, my chair is comfortable, my body is warm and the air is no longer super dry.  With the legs and back being heated my arms are no longer frozen and I finally have feeling in my fingers.As a bonus, the heated pad is great for any soreness in legs and lower back, which has made my sleep significantly better.  Highly recommend this item.
During the great glove shortage of 2020, I decided to invest in some long reusable gloves. While they aren’t as form fitting as regular nitrile gloves, I’m able to wipe down groceries and open packages just fine.Maybe someday soon I will use them for their original intent and wash the dishes with them.
This essential oil is a blend of sweet orange, neroli, and thyme. The combination evolves into a delicious orange aroma. I use about four to five drops in each of my diffusers and the fragrance wafts through the entire room. It is lovely.The current price of $9.99 is expensive for .17 fluid ounces; however, since I like the aroma so much, I did not take off one star for the high price.
Very nice. Glad I found it on the internet but personally I feel $16.00 too much in price  for this tiny small bottle. I do like Frankincense and Myrrh.  recommend-glad when it goes on so so sale. It is a good oil.  Thanks.
Perfect for just about anything. Been using these about 6 months now and they are durable. Used for colloidal silver in the eyes, ears and nose when necessary and never let us down!
Fast delivery and work steadily.
I gave this a five star for easy to inflate because I had a special pump from a previous purchase that made this easy.  Without a pump, it would not be easy.  This was a great affordable 2020 decorations.
There are some good things and less good about this, but the review comes with the caveat that sleep preferences are so individual that it's tough to say how much one's view should hold for someone else. But that said:1) Size:  the footprint is nice. It doesn't take up a lot of space; I'd call it medium size maybe leaning toward small. I've definitely seen many that were bigger, so you don't need a lot of space to use this2) lighting:  I'd prefer a dimmer light personally, thought the breath function and colors are nice. If you have this right near the bed, it's a bit too bright I'd say, but if it's obstructed or you're  not facing it than it isn't bad at all.3) volume:  volume control is good--I'm not sure why you'd want it loud (I guess if you have a lot of street noise), but it can get a decent volume on it4) sounds:  this was the more problematic issue for us. We just didn't find many of the sounds pleasurable or soothing. Some would have soothing parts, but then a loud surge of sound would appear, which would seem to defeat the purpose. We've heard others that were just more tranquil, soothing. some of that can be somewhat ameliorated by the volume control obviously, but still wasn't what we were expecting. There are a good number and variety, but honestly we'd only use 3, possibly 4. On the other hand, if you're looking for "drown-out" sound, you might find that less of an issue5) timer is good and works well. Never understood ones that came without them, so this is a good, I'd say required, touchIt's a useful, solid product, but not quite as all-around useful as its numbers of lightssounds might indicate. At least for us.  No concerns over quality--feels well constructed and responsive
I listened to the audiobook (magnesium miracle) and read so many good reviews. I took this for anxiety, which I get very easily. 2 to 3 hours after I consumed this, I had very bad anxiety for no reason.  It is no fun feeling like you can’t get a good breath of air and your heart is beating so fast.  I will not take another drop.  As everything I purchase on Amazon, I always get to return if not satisfied.  But checking this better, I cannot return it. Therefore $29.99 plus tax of $2.72 and shipping cost of $6.94, $39.65 down the drain.
Fits perfectly
Biz beats every other laundry additive I've every used.  My mom used it decades ago when I was growing up and it still works better than anything else on the market.  I can't figure out why it's so hard to find in stores.  I guess because they don't spend a lot on mass advertising so there is little demand.  Most sellers on Amazon were pretty expensive IMO but by buying a pack of 4 boxes I got the best price.  It'll probably last until my grandkids grow up but at least I have a good stash now!  For really tough stains, make a paste and spread the paste on stain.  let it sit and work for up to hours before washing.  Ive never had an issue with this technique damaging colors.
Good quality
Love these to clean my mat with and to spray for odor. Mine didn’t come with 6 towels, but I contacted a rep, and she replied and personally mailed me the 6 replacement towels.
Bought two of these for my husband. He’s a big man and no “one size fits all” works. This one did. He’s not quite as cranky wearing this mask and he likes how it has the neck strap so he can rip it off the minute it’s allowed and it hangs from his neck. I just ordered one for myself just because it’s bigger and hopefully I can breath easier in it. We are not happy mask ppl. We both wear glasses that fog up when wearing them. They still fog up with this one, but adjusted just right and it’s not as bad.
Did  not help me with shoe slipping
The paper towels are very soft and the design is simply beautiful. The value of the paper towels are great. And I think these towels can be good decoration for my room.
Great way to supplement your daily smoothiefruitveggie shake with vitamins. Given that this is certified organic, Vegan & Non-GMO, it is a great all natural way to give your body an extra boost of Vitamin C. I am deleting a star simply because when I first tried to mix this in just juice, I saw that the powder does not mix well (my juice was cloudy). However, I started instead to mix it with my smoothies and it worked perfectly. No taste, blends well when the mixture is thicker.
These are just like the ones they put in your car at the carwash and the smell lasts a long time.
Love the large size, does the job!
This contraption works.  I have a little tummy and some of my jeans fit fine in the hips but pinch at the waist.  I stretch them out using this device and wallah, they fit like they are custom made!
Great product easy to take and I believe effective. I trust Life Extensions as a company I consider them to have integrity and they certainly have a good reputation.
I have been taking this pill for a few days and they are easy to swallow. The instructions say to take with a meal, so I have been taking them with my lunch. The smell is a bit unpleasant at first, but you get used to it after a few days. Haven’t noticed any changes yet, but I am sure that will come within time. You can’t go wrong with the price compared to other probiotics!!
My sheepskin boots don't have a removable insole and had gotten very unfluffy at the bottom. These fixed that and I will get at least another year out of the boots. Thanks!
These gloves fit as expected.  I use them mostly for household chores but will use them for washing things outside such as vehicles and patio furniture once the snow thaws and Springtime arrives.  I have no preference for either lined or unlined.  I especially like them for washing fragile glass items because even in soapy water the gloves keep the glassware from slipping out of my hands.  I also like the length for protecting my hands and forearms while reaching into a bucket.
Perfect for a small bathroom
Having two kids we have tried few similar items I can say that this one is much gentler on kids than frida.It is easy to use and works fast and easy to clean.
product is amazing thank you
They use intesinal binding fillers - maybe that's why no full label I.E.> ingred's shown. My glands swell, cannot swallow and I lose fingernails if ingest Magnesium Stearate. It is NOT benign.
I needed a strap for my son who wears glasses and has hearing aids. Something that would allow him to easily pull his mask up and down without pulling off his hearing aids. The strap connects to the mask and fits nicely around the back of the neck. Which means one less thing behind my son's ears. These straps were super easy to attach to the mask. They adjust easily and the quantity ensures I have plenty in case some are lost. They also wash up well in case I forget to detatch them from the cloth mask during washing. I highly recommend these straps for those who struggle with straps behind the ears.
Tasteless, does not whiten as I expected
My mom raved about the old fashioned Norelco electric razors, but I'd never tried one quite like it. This 5-head razor gives me the closest shave ever! Where has it been all my life? Usually my electric razors are good in a pinch, but they always make look like I have 1-2 days growth. This shaver is different. It's just as close as a manual razor. My legs and underarms are just as smooth as if I've just whipped out the shaving cream and straight razor. I also love how the five heads are put together in natural curves to complement the human body. It's as if this was custom designed to fit over my knee caps - and how many electric shavers can actually get the knees smooth? Up and down, or around in circles, this safe razor will never hurt you.As an awesome bonus, this razor comes with several attachments. (To change attachments, and to clean it, read the manual and have some faith that pushing and pulling won't break the device.) I've tried the trimmer with the three levels of attachments, and it's not barber-quality but it's good enough in a pinch. The facial massage and scrubber are really nice. The dry brush massage is so gentle, and the soft plastic scrubber really adds an extra oomph to my cleanser. Thankfully, I haven't had to use the nose hair clippers, so I can't report on the effectiveness.It also comes with a little brush to clean under the heads (again, read the manual), and a small bottle of oil so you can replenish the lubrication. My device came pre-lubricated, which was nice. It's easy to hold, quick and easy to charge in a USB port (cord included), and the electric display shows how much time is left before you need to recharge. It is not waterproof, though, so don't take it into the bath. Dry off and use it after.
I tried using this for a few days and the hardness of the plastic really bothered me. The literature that came with the item did say the plastic was hard and it might take you some time to get used to it, but I got headaches and only used it a short time.I did keep it and may try using it again.
Does the job
TASTES AWFUL. Hope it works to steady my gait
The bristles only extend about halfway up my teeth.  My teeth were not clean after using this. It's in the trash already.
to slick a material  food falls to floor
Good product, love that it's clean, but does not dissolve as well as other brands of peptides I have tried. Their BCAA's are awesome though!
Works very well for our needs
Great PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING
I buy the big box of eggs and was reusing the stryophome cartoons and I came across these and have never looked back!
We love these. Great taste and consistency. $5 a bag cheaper than Vitamin Shoppe. Delivered to my door. Awesome!
They work really well but i hate bubble gum flavor. That being said, its not overpowering.
The compression is literally comforting.
I am new to this brand Joon X Moon and find them very giftable.  The packaging is beautiful and their scrubs and bubble bath fizz formulas would cheer me or my friends up at the end of a long week.The Bubbling Bath Fizz has a lovely scent which permeates the bathroom for a while as well.  I tried both the Lavender and the Champagne scents and loved them. The instructions don't say how much to put, so I put 2 capfuls and this was enough to give gentle bubbles and a lovely scent.The lavender is strong but not medicinal and the champagne has a slightly fruitier almost lychee undertone.  Both are lovely and not overly sweet.  The bubbles are soft and plentiful and the scents are relaxing and make me feel like I am somewhere else.  The minerals in the bath also feel soothing.  Overall, it feels very pampering and helps to wash away a tough week.I love the way that these bottles look in the bathroom as well.  Another reviewer mentioned they'd prefer to have them in glass containers, but it feels safer not to have glass in the bathroom where it might slip or get knocked off.
Little packets resisted tearing open for me. I ended up needing scissors or a knife to easily open these. The flavor was okay. Seemed to help in hydrating the skin something I need a lot of help with. I've had better mix-ins and I've had worse.
I’ve taken milk thistle for several years to protect my liver against the daily damage I do to it with alcohol, ibuprofen and whatever else hurts it!! This product is as good as it gets. Very high concentration, super clean smelling. 120 capsules per bottle = excellent value. I take nightly. My last blood screens came back in normal range, doc said all looks great. I believe in the power of this!
They are vary good to use
So I had been buying the primal life dirty mouth tooth powder and was loving it except the price was gouging me. So I went on the hunt for a more affordable tooth powder option. I stumbled upon this for half the price and decided to give it a go. In terms of tooth cleanliness it probably works about the same? Ya about the same however, it sucks every single last drop of moisture out of your mouth the second it hits it. The mint is also not very strong at all. It in no way helps freshen my breath and my husband and I have started having to use mouth wash which IMO defeats the purpose of going chemical free. Also, because it does suck moisture out I’ve found that chunks of it get stuck to my teeth or gums and I have to do a clean run through of my toothbrush with just water on it to get this off. Just swigging with water won’t do it. We’ve hand this over a month and still have over half the jar left so honestly it’s a good amount of product for what you pay...I’m still on the fence though if I’m gonna reorder this or go back to the primal life toothe powder....
This item was purchased as a gift for my insomniac Mother-In-Law.She absolutely loved the feature of stars on the ceiling.She said that it reminded her of camping as a young girl, out under the stars.The soothing tones and sparkling stars have put this Grandma to sleep !!!
-Colors match picture-Mix of vibrant black and grey-Material is a little tough-seems very tight, making it kind of hard-lathers okay, but not so good because of how tight it is-used it about 3 times so far and seems to be loosening up
Works great and shipped quickly!
My puppies ignore this. I was disappointed became they chew everything, shoes, furniture chairs, etc. I had wished they would love this instead. They do like pigs ears.
I purchased this wrap for after the shower while I'm getting ready for work. It's thin, but still absorbent, and the color is a pretty blue. The velcro is easy to attachdetach when putting on the wrap. The length could be shorter for me to love it, but it still serves the purpose, and well!
I have never liked sponges until now. Magic Eraser does a better job on my washable wallpaper than terry. It did not scratch or cloud up my chrome fixtures when I removed hard water deposits, and I didn't even have to use vinegar. After testing a spot, I cleaned my stainless steel sink. I'm looking forward to wiping my showertub without cleaning product fumes. I won't use the sponge everywhere for everything, but for those 4 chores, it's a winner.
I’ve had them for a day and I LOVE them, I work outside all day and it was a pain to keep switching from my sunglasses to my readers now I don’t have to unless I’m in a poorly lit place I highly recommend them 😎
Really expensive for what you get.  Not really that exciting. If you are looking for a laugh and want to spend a lot to get it....then go ahead.
This is a supplement in powder format that you mix with water. The mixing process isn't totally smooth, there are generally little clumps in the water. But it doesn't really bother me that much; I'm just trying to get it down quickly anway. There is a taste, but it's not anything terrible, and is pretty easy to get down. As to the results, I can't tell at this point if this has changed my digestion. But I do find the research very interesting, and will continue to see how things progress as I continue to take this each day.
I have a few of these towel wraps and find them very convenient.  I usually use them when I'm getting ready instead of wearing a robe.  They're reasonably absorbent, they stay in place, and are less bulky than a robe.  Laundering is easy and inexpensive and they provide decent coverage.
These gloves are awesome! Thick enough that someone as clumsy as me don't have to worry about destroying them.
My wife loves this lotion.  She does not have diabetes but does have dry, scaly feet. Blue Emu does the job for her.
I was initially skeptical about this, thinking that it might leave white marks on my body or make my towel oily. But turns out it's super easy to apply after shower because of all the moisture still left on the skin. And it turns clear on the skin after applying and doesn't stain my towel either. I like how smooth it feels and how fast and easy to apply. Will toss out my regular lotion and use this one from now on.
I was really looking forward to receiving this item because of the way it appeared on the site. Unfortunately, my first night using it was a bid disappointment. The mask is soft and plush to the touch, however, when worn at night, the nose bridge part presses way too hard on the top of the nose and impedes breathing. If I loosen the strap (which is not velcro and gets tangled in the hair) the mask then is too loose and falls off the face. The pads press just too much on the bottoms of the eyes and make it uncomfortable to breathe and turn the head. The strap gets tangled in the hair because you can't velcro it over the back, you have to pull it over the head. The padding is weighted incorrectly and caused me discomfort while trying to breathe and sleep with it therefore I had to return it.  Maybe for less sensitive sleepers this might work - but this was advertised as designed for ultra comfort and sensitivity.
Bought this for my 76 year old mom who does not have a land line. Her cell does not ring loud enough at home. Needed it to be louder so she could hear it everywhere in the condo and this device does the trick. She is very satisfied.
This really is an excellent toe nail clipper....much better than the typical style most people use, and easily the best I have tried. The long-handled small scissors-on-the-end type are hard to use and often do not cut cleanly and easily.For the average person, however, I'm not sure I would recommend it for fingernails, since it can leave a bit of a rough edge.
Is it just me? Or has the company started using less LOTION in their product.  It’s just the same as using regular puffs of Kleenex.
Good product. Better than liquid. Always rely on it. Will order again when needed. Good price
They run small. Son is thin and wears a size 9.5 shoe. These are tight on him. If you are a bigger person they may be uncomfortabletight.
After installing this to my Waterpik and trying it out for the first time there is a slight leak that drips from the handle down the hose.  It’s only a few drops each use but there shouldn’t be any.  Also, I can’t explain why the pressure doesn’t seem to be as strong as the original.
I bought this for my sister, who is onto special effects makeup, as a birthday gift. In the description it says that this item is ammonia free which was exciting because she always complains about her eyes burning because of the ammonia. I just opened the package and on the ingredients list is ammonia hydroxide and ammonia! I'm sure she will still love the liquid latex but it's disappointing that it has ammonia in it. I will not repurchase this.
I normally just clean my mat with soap & water, but this method tends to make the mat too slippery, which is unsafe. This cleaner comes with a microfiber cloth, and it only takes a quick spray or two to cleanse the entire surface without losing grip. I would recommend this product to anyone who regularly uses a mat.
This could have a been a nice desserty protein bar, coming out of your dessertsnacks calorie budget instead of the main meals. Unfortunately the various mass market ingredients they put in it give it a not so pleasant after taste. An after taste I never get with protein bars that use only &#34;real food&#34; ingredients.So while it tastes fine while you eat it, and tempts you to forgive the long list of ingredients, the after taste is a reminder of what it is :( Maybe they can make &#34;real food&#34; version of this?The 6-pack is stored in a sturdy compact purple cardboard box which you can easily repurpose for other household uses if you open it gently.Nutrition wise, it has plenty of vitamins and minerals. Protein &#34;wins&#34; 15-14 over sugars. Itt is a product of Canada.Sweetening in this is done with, among others, glucose syrup, sugar, glycerine, high maltose corn syrup, evaporated cane sugar, fructose, dextrose, etc.This is so frustrating because it's a promising taste combo with 15g of protein but you get all kinds of corporate food crap including carrageenan.
Sleep....too much noise around here!
Accurate description fast shipping
too tight
Did nothing for me
Just as described. Holds to basics.
I heard about these a few years ago, how great they are for your teeth. Well, after finally trying them I must say that they did not disappoint. First of all with these, each one is individually wrapped and they look very sanitary. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all peeling off the outer bark and chewing on the stick. It does have a flavor which is sort of indescribable, but bits can come off in your mouth and they are much like shredded coconut. Anyway, after softening and chewing the tip in your mouth by gently chewing on it, the fibers fan out to form a brush. While the stick is long, it's impossible to get the inside of your teeth, but as you use it up it's easier to get your hand in there.So, I wouldn't use these as a replacement for my toothbrush, but they are a wonderful accompaniment. My teeth feel great after using it. It brushes all the plaque away and leaves you feeling super clean but without any mint. Each stick lasts quite a while because you only use half an inch each time, and then use a scissors to snip off the used part so that it remains sanitary.If you've never tried these, all I can say is that my experience was pretty good and I would definitely recommend them. I hope this review and the video has helped you to decide if you'd like to invest in these.
i dont know if the good reviews are paid to say what they are saying, but this item certainly did NOT work for me. A waste of $20. I have wavy hair, and its not hard to manage but this brush did not straighten it at all.
Get the same results buying the ones in Target.I would not purchase these.
My two cats often get runny eyesallergycold side effects. This helps tremendously.
I purchased the &#34;Got Milk&#34; straws on sale for 1.796pk at Target, and my kids loved them. I wasnt going to Target for a few weeks, so I decided to purchase these since it is a mix of flavors.  My kids so far have enjoyed them.  They are a bit more expensive, but the container is very nice, and the lid snaps on so they are not in a ziploc bag or just laying on a pantry shelf.  I think it was worth the purchase for the container alone!  They look just like the &#34;GOT MILK&#34; straws, but that is nowhere on the package.  This definitely is a mix, it is not a single flavor, which is nice and exciting for the kids.
I buy these monthly and I have no complaints.  I don't mind the boost of energy these give you.  The only thing missing is Iron which I don't think is ever contained in a daily vitamin anyway.
Bought these for my husband and he loves them we use them about three times before throwing away.
Easy to carry. And works perfectly.
WEIRD TEXTURE not so good
Lathers nicely, convenient pump, moisturizing, but smells like a cheap pina colada you wish you hadn't bought.
Works well with all smoking parts. Worth the extra $2 to get the cap holes for stems and bowls.
Great addition to shaving cream! This glycerin really helps shaving cream retain water in its lather - this seems be the secret to a thick and rich shaving cream that one whips up with a shaving brush. The quart size is a great value. I only have one minor complaint - the bottle does not have lid that lends itself to controlled dispensing. I addressed this minor quibble by using an old squeeze bottle with a dropper top.
I have C-Spine injury I am treating with decompression therapy in doctor's office.  This device allows me support and decompression like therapy at home and is easy to use. Adjustable tension to fit your needs. A little uncomfortable on the ears takes some getting used to.
It's fine. I have my preferences over this. This is a nice blend of various collagen sources (bovine, marine, poultry, eggshell) and therefore a wider degree of collagen types (1, 2, 3, 5, 10). Hence the elevated price tag (I don't rate on price, but I will comment that it should be compared to others of this ilk. It is with similar price range). Some sources are more expensive. Some sources don't require as much to be effective. Ie, bovine is cheapest, but needs more, marine is usually most expensive yet needs a lot less. This has a good amount, well fair amount, per serving at about 8 grams of collagen peptides (hydrolyzed- meaning it is broken down to readily absorbable, easily digestible form, and it mixes in hot or cold without gelling).Multi forms can impart a slight smell and flavor. I think the ones that use eggshell tend to have a little extra aroma. May disappear depending on what it is being used in. Or might be noticeable. Not a big fan of it in my plain black unsweetened coffee, but is totally fine in a smoothie, or when I have a coffee that I doctor up with cream and flavor syrup. I dont fault the brand, as it is merely a facet of the composition. I will always used collagen, often single source, but will pepper in multi source as I see fit.This is a perfectly fine product. Though I recommend that they actually include a picture of the nutritional information. We dont need to see half a dozen pictures of people drinking it. Let us know what is in it. Had I been shopping around for it, I would have passed this over for a listing that tells me all that I am getting.Though I am pleased to see this:"If you’re not 100% satisfied with your purchase, we’ll issue you a refund."
These all smell great and worked well! Very moisturizing and fun to use in the bath! We loved each and every one of them!!
A bit greasy but works well.
My partner likes to fall asleep to youtube, podcasts, and not the quiet kind either, music, laughter. I cannot tune that stuff out. Bought this pillow mat in desperation, not really trusting reviews, but it honestly and truly works. He puts it under his head and I can't hear a thing. I can't even tell it's on.  He says it's perfectly comfortable. Much more comfortable than headphones or headbands with speakers. Some people say the wire breaks after a lot of use. Honestly, I don't care. I mean, I hope it holds up, but since this is the only solution that works for us, we'll just spring for another one.The only downside is, he can't use it very well when he's sitting up in bed, so we need both headphones and the pillow mat.
These were great tissues. Good for dry noses as well.
Nice small and powerful
Comfortable fit well good value for price
I've been using this tumeric for over a month now and its a good product.
This is a very cool scale. I have a Fitbit Zip and I have the app on my Android phone when I weigh myself the weight and the body fat percent travels right over to my phone! It took a little while to understand how to set it up but it works great and I love it!
This is significantly larger than most adjustable adult collars, and after having it on for only a half hour, the Velcro that the strap attaches to came off. Not nearly as good as the ones we used to keep on the ambulances. (I’m a former EMT in one of the busiest jurisdictions in the country, just for some perspective.) I’m really only giving it two stars because it’s nice to see one in olive drab instead of blue and yellow.
Bought these for my husband as certain shoes were rubbing on ankle bone and irritating. Fit him well and cushion stays in place. Easy to hand wash and dries overnight. Good product would buy again.
This is a great way to get zinc, which has so many valuable properties for health. Just a few good tasting drops per day of this readily absorbed form and you're good to go. One less capsule or tablet to take. Good value.
The big question - can you tell it's fish oil? Not really.  It's orange flavored, which does a good job of masking the taste, and you really can't tell that they're fish by nature.  Not saying that they're a perfect orange flavor - there's something undefinable about the taste that is just a little odd, but if I told you they were gummy candies, you probably wouldn't bat an eyelash.  Decent Omega-3 content, and if you don't like the pill version of fish oil, this will work quite well.
I've had very good results using this toothpaste after a couple of weeks. It's very pleasant to use, with a nice aftertaste, and it leaves my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean. I have noticed some whitening, as well. Three tubes for the current price of $18.99 is a decent deal.
doesn't work all the time
Perfect for variety of holiday gifts.
Great product quick delivery very satisfied
As expected . ..good quality  bandaids
I got these as a gift and will not return them, but they are very clunky to walk in. Massage barely noticeable while standing and VERY ( I MEAN ANNOYINGLY) loud buzzing while sitting. can't hear TV over the buzz. Was a nice thought for a gift I wouldnt recommend them
Dear cats decided to hurl my old one off my desk and cracked the lid in half.So I got this replacement. It's the same, but was hard to get together and hard to get apart, and rattled.I got some Vaseline, ran a little around the grooves, and now it's easy to open, easy to close, and doesn't rattle, feels much better. Yay vaseline.
not a bad taste at all
The don’t scrub like I wanted
When growing up, we often had a battery bag, which contained batteries of various sizes and makes which had been pulled from electronics or opened battery packages and were "still good" in one way or another. I am a creature of order, however, and such slap-dash methods are no longer satisfactory to me, especially since there is the possibility of a circuit being created in there between cells of various sizes and charges.This is a far more elegant solution. I have these sorts of holders for every kind of battery I own, and they are all neatly stored in a ziplock bag in a box. I always know exactly how many batteries I have and thus when I need to order more. The cells are kept isolated from one-another and in tight formation. I even keep a couple in my hiking pack - no digging around the bottom of the bag for a stray AAA attempting an escape.If I am giving someone a gift which requires batteries, I will usually include a holder like this with it, filled with the appropriate type of lithium cells. The presentation is on-point and it ensure that not only can they use the gift immediately, but can continue to use it for the next couple years or so.The build quality is good, the batteries are easy to insert and remove, and the clear plastic leaves no question as to how many cells are in the holder and what sort of cells they are.Would recommend.
Do not waste your money.  These are a joke.  They wrinkle up once they get wet and then the center never dries.  Its like trying to wash with a wrinkly piece of cardboard.
I bought this  because my dr reccomended,It works great!
These disposable masks are like every other 3-ply disposable mask of this type that I tried so far. They have comfortable ear elastics and the mask is pleated and moldable to the nose with the interior wire.  There are 50 masks in this package.  The current price of $8.99 is a great deal for 50 which comes to $.18 cents each.  Since these are disposable, they are not designed to last, obviously.
The flavour is very good and it keeps me feeling my best with better energy and digestion and I take it daily.
I like this product. It does the job. I just don’t like how if you don’t wipe it totally off, there’s pink residue that sits on your things. I mean, unless you know it’s cleaner, it ends up looking gross. Maybe I just need to do a better job cleaning? I’m not sure.
I'm thinking that this thing would've been bigger than that tiny thing (i've gotten in my mailed box SMH) but guessed wrong SMH I've had kept my money I used it once and didn't have my skin feeling flawless right so I'm better than using my hands instead of using this seriously OMG when I washed my face with my hands it feels super flawless soft and also right with the face washed I gotten from the store makes it's super flawless soft and cleaned as ever hands down seriously!!!!!? God bless
These fit my son's toothbrush perfectly and they work just like the ones that came with it.
I been looking for one of these for a good price and I came across this one. Study and heavy and really works. There is different heads and the speed is gradually increased so that you won't be hit with a woop quickly. I like the one with the round tip for specific points to focus one. Battery like is good too since I used for about a week without recharging it.
I am always on the lookout for some good mangesium powders.  I use them at night before I go to sleep.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a glass jar and is well packed.FULL?The jar in the photo was taken after I only took two scoops of product.  The fill line is about where the top of the yellow label is.  It really should be a bit fuller than it was.EASY TO TAKE?This is not difficult to take.  It is warm water to activate and then add cool water to drink it.FLAVOR?I did not find the flavor offensive.  Some of the magnesium drinks have lots of stevia which makes me gag.  This one was not like that for me at all.  It is actually pleasant to take uncluttered with sweetners.DOES IT HELPThis is really helpful to relax me at night.THE BOTTOM LINEThis powder is pleasant to take.  It is not cluttered with stevia or other additives.MY RATINGFIVE STARS. I am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added.  I only wish it was a little fuller.
Very difficult ft tissues
Came fast, good enough quality!
I understand the chemistry behind hydrogen peroxide-based cleaners.  But even so, this product seems to work better than it should.  I was cleaning around the door knobs of our exterior doors...you know - the areas that always become soiled on a door.  The dirt and soil just seemed to be "evaporating".  In other words I wasn't seeing most of the dirt and soil transfer to the paper towels I was wiping with.  It was just disappearing.  Amazing stuff...
Capsule was deflated. I brought the capsule to my Physical Therapist who recommended the device. The PT said the capsule was deflated meaning there was not enough gelatin inside it for the device to perform what it was meant for.
Always running out of these. Now have ample supply to keep a box in almost every room.
works for me!
great product and Multiple Uses! Great on beards & use one for dog massage and hair removal
this was a reorder
70% alcohol was hard to find and somewhat expensive due to covid scare.
I've reviewed a lot apple cider vinegar gummies and these are my least favorite of all of them.  The flavor is just o.k. and the texture is not very gummy-like.  I like that these have the mother, but that's about all they have going for them except for a little B9 and B12 vitamins.
There are two slim-profile six-cell travel-sized pill cases in this package along with 54 labels. Each of the cells has a good clasp that snaps tightly shut. In my photo, I was able to fit 20 of my 50mcg D3 tablets into one cell. Their portability and slim-profile are the best features. Note that it will not store more than a couple of  "horse-sized" pills and may not be able to store any depending on the size of the capsule. The cell covers do not fully stay open when removing or inserting the pills, so be prepared for it to stay only partially open.Also note that there is a right way and wrong way to insert the case into its holder. The side with the finger nubs on the case is the correct face-up position to insert the pill case with the lids facing up. It does not go in correctly if the case is flipped.The current price of $8.99 is competitively priced as it comes to $4 per case.
Solid, built!!  I wish the handle was a little longer.
Great buy :) very happy
I have used these in the past and like them very much for buffing the ends of my nails that are currently having a tendency to chip.  For the price these work very well and I would recommend them.
When the puppy has an oops, I usually use a product with enzymes in it to break down the odors and any oops that needs to be removed. This I have been putting on the patio, where both go to potty to remove that odor, too. I have been using this all over the place. It takes a while to dry,  but it works.
I have extremely low blood pressure. My cardiologist recommended that I eat more salt. Unfortunately, I was unable to eat enough to raise my blood pressure. The pills helped a little more than salting my food. Now I’m taking a prescription medication to raise my blood pressure to normal so I don’t fall if I stand up quickly.
Kind of difficult if you have thicker hair like I do. Personally, I still prefer my round bun maker. Thin hair may be able to use this with little to no difficulty.
I purchased the petals to use in a ash scatter ceremony.  The petals were beautiful, looked just like the picture and smelled wonderful.  There was a large amount and it was definitely worth the money. Although it was for a sad purpose, the petals added a pretty touch. Very happy I made this purchase.
Used on ^04 bisque. Let the wax dry overnight and glazed my pottery the next day to ^6. Worked great. Keeps most of the glaze off the waxed areas. Easily wipes clean (the excess glaze which had beaded up on a couple waxed spots) with a wet paper towelcloth. Melts away leaving the unfinished clay after fireing. I'll buy it again when it runs out.
These pretty gloves are durable and versatile. The two pairs of purple ones are lined while the white and yellow ones are unlined. Both are comfortable and strong. They are great for any number of tasks from household cleaning to gardening to shampooing the dogs. The palms and fingers are textured. They do not contain latex. The scalloped edges are attractice and they come up over the wrists. Great gloves.
Works great for the Price!!!!! I wash my face with it twice a day gets thru that great...I message my husband forehead & back with it be loves it everything I do, I do it so very gentle...it can not withhold very much pressure...but it 150% works for Sat I got it for at great price!! The stone attachment and other 2 are beyond useless tho wish it had another brush!!!! Anyhow I can't beat that price!
Not great direction on how to specifically use, had to YouTube it, got stuck in hair a few times that hurt and tied a not, but after YouTube,  I was able to figure it out. Battery doesn't stayed charged for 60 mins as stated: did 6 strands and 50% battery down.  Why don't products with USB cords come with outlet plug-ins? Can't do my half head without it dying, not worth buying only if u have shirt thin hair.
Doesn’t really clean anything..
Fabulous stuff for your everyday needs
This made my skin feel so smooth and look so clear.
The upside is that this is a very well made little lamp.it's easy to start and produces a hot and steady flame.If you need a light duty flame hot enough to heat a test tube or sterilize inoculation needle it's just fine.If you need a bigger flame as standard wick based lamp is better.I use everclear as fuel as I needed non toxic vapors.Over all a well made product.
I have been mixing this powder into my morning smoothies.. not part of a workout routine.. just for added energy and nutrition. I really like it and cannot taste the powder at all! I highly recommend this powder. My old gripe is that the packaging is a little small.. or smaller than I expected.. and there is no measuring spoon (or tool) included.

Mixes well with anything. Helps digestion. I use daily mix with cucumber.
These are comfortable to sleep in, and I like the ones that are connected, so I don't lose them.
These inserts are great ! They were recommended by my Dr. and have been a great addition ! I will continue to use them.
This toilet paper roll will be funny when opened.  But for the size of the roll, I found it to be very expensive.
My 7 yr old granddaughter wears the masks every night, and she loves them.  She used to wear a plain black mask, but no more,  Sometimes during the day, I see her with the mask on top of her head!
Use these in home security system Seem to be just as good as Duracell
This is great to get that extra blood flow going and definitely more affordable then some of the other brands. If you play sports or engage in high activity I highly recommend this product. I use for weights and jogging. L Arginine is always a good supplement to use.
Does a fair job whoever  iif you are supposed to prick your finger, you need lancelets
These are great! Measure your calves because it makes a difference. If your calves are wide then order accordingly. Great colors to choose from, too.
Easy to apply and remove. They can get slick if your face gets sweaty or oily. They are nice and thin so they don’t affect the way your glasses fit tremendously other than to give them a little more stability.
Pretty expensive, but does the job.
These are delicious, to the point that its hard to just suck on them and not eat the bag. They didn't do much for my throat, but they were tasty enough to take my mind off it. They are overpriced though, not worth a 50 cents a lozenge.
They're pretty basic and work fine but there are a lot of them so it's a good deal.
These are the same ones they sell at my gym for 50 cents a pair.  They are a bit awkward but considering you wear them for 5 minutes and then toss in the trash, they work fine :). Plus, they eliminate any tan lines around the eyes like the around-the-head eye-protectors.
Good valueprice for glass cleaners.
right on!
This is my third order of this.  We both like them.  The taste is good and even better when mixed with a little orange juice.  This is a good way for us to get added electrolytes and also get vitamins.We like this and are happy to have it.
Nice and heavy duty. Was perfect
Can't live without it!!
My 6-year-old loves wearing a sleep mask to bed. This one is so cute and comfortable she loves it. The material is really soft and it stays on all night long. The fact that it's Disney makes it that more special and loved.
I have been adding collagen powder to my coffee for over a year now. I really like this one. It is undetected once in my hot cup of coffee. It dissolves very quickly and leaves no clumping. I have noticed improvement in my knees and lower back since using collagen. I will keep taking it for as long as I can!
Using it in my car has helped tremendously with pain running up the backs of my legs! Thank you!
This is probably pretty gross. I Purchased a burn brush to clean out my coffee pot and remove seven years of build up inside of it but it was still a little unsettled but maybe the inside of the pot was not 100% cleaned. So I purchased this and put some in the pot left it in there for about for five hours and then poured it out and then looked inside the pot and it was shiny include stainless steel which was excellent. I rinsed it out twice. This morning I had my 1st cup of coffee out of the pot and it tasted great well I’ve been missing over the last couple years of not having a totally crystal clean product I recommend the strongly I will definitely re-purchase this in the future and plan on using it on a regular basis to avoid seven years of scale that was disgusting.
thumbs up
I've taken this product for years and I've watched the price rise from $40 to almost $70.  Since I never wanted to run out I order a few in advance and they come wrapped in a plastic you cannot see through.  The instructions have always been, 2 scoops a day.  But NOW, without every saying a word, they DOUBLED the size of the scope but didn't increase the amount of product.  It's literally twice the size.  So now you are getting a crap load of filler and using twice the product, so twice the price, without you ever noticing.  I'll use up what I have because it's too late to return, but I will never buy from this company again.  What a total bate and switch.
Best wrap made
These are actually really tasty.  I use them for a quick breakfast on a busy day and honestly they keep me full until lunch.  I also like these for those exhausting workout sessions.  Perfect for and all day hike also.  Taste is like a peanut butter cup with a smooth chew texture.  Easy to break into 1 hour portions if your on a grueling day and want to portion this out.  Great protien content and calorie ratio.  This is a real winner
I suffer from a chronic pain condition and sadly have found it necessary to buy a seat for my shower because I can no longer stand up long enough to shower without intense pain. I am on the younger side and the idea of having a medical supplies looking seat in my shower embarrassed me so much (well having a seat at all embarrasses me but we do what we have to right?) So i was thrilled to find these cute little bath stools. I was worried it wouldn't hold up as well but so far it's really perfect! It's comfortable, doesn't take up much room in my shower and it's cute! People think I bought it to get a spa like experience in my shower which works for me! Ha ha. :) The legs look thin in there photo but it has zero issues holding me up and it's perfectly sturdy. Claims to hold up to 300lbs and I feel safe using it. Thanks to the company who makes these, giving us more stylish choices for products we really wish we didn't need.
Seems like a quality product. I mixed a scoop with water, ice and frozen banana for a quick protein smoothie. It tasted great and was filling and satisfying.
Good product.
This is the 3rd different brand I have tried, and this one stands out.  It's greener, tastes fresher and seems more alive.One small complaint, and it's very small is it's a little hard to get the lumps out. No big deal, really.  I just put about 12 cupcool water in a glass and stir in the barley and wheat grass. I have to smash the lumps against the side of the glass, butthis one tastes so alive....I would not trade it....
Very practice and useful tool, use it everyday!
Simple to use, works awesome.
I use it on sunglasses that do not have grip on the nose part. It works just as advertised. Need to bring a few extra pairs during travel since at some point you may need to change them due to sunscreen usage, continuous use with activities.
Needed for back pain and it’s been working just fine.
As it turned out, I have not used this product yet.  It was suggested that I take it on a vacation but I encountered no blister problems.  However, another person borrowed it and said it helped their foot feel betterl  The blister never did fully develop.
My dentist recommended this type of tooth brush. I like the feeling of the brush on my sensitive mouth.
Perfect for my bedside comode
The oil doesn't absorb too quickly, but I really like the scent and how it makes my skin feel. The smell reminds me of sensual jasmine.
Awesome kit that I keep near me at all times. I keep one in my belt and one in my bag at all times. These things are literal lifesavers.
Works much better than I expected and I adore the handle... I can reach everywhere!
These ear plugs are great at keeping out noise but not so great for sleeping. I find them a tad too hard of a plastic to be comfortable in my ears when laying on my sides. I also find my ears itching a lot as well, so I have no idea what sort of material these are made of but for sleeping, no, I would not purchase these again. For outdoor work, yes, they would work just great if they didn’t make your ears itch.
These hanging witch were a fun addition to the house. My wife picked up this one because it was so ugly, it was cute. She has a habit of doing that lately.These witches are pretty well made. Burlap makes the dress, hat. The hair feels like paint brush bristles, but it works. The face's are well painted and there is a decent amount of detail in the face, hands and feet. It's all tied together with a bit of twine and there you go. Sit it on a broom with a welcome board attached like swing and there you have it.I thought they were so great, I bought her two more she's hung in our room. They are have slightly  differentshades of burlap to separate one from the other. But they made her smile and that's what I was going for. I definitely recommend this for the it's so ugly, it's cute person in your life. Enjoy
Pro:Magnetic closure works wellWell madeGreat valueCons:Cannot think of any !!
This is a perfect addition to some walkers.  Comes with liner that can easily be cleaned up without having to remove the tray from the walker.  However, pay close attention to the product images . . . this will not work on all walkers.  There must be a crossbar atnear the top of the walker for this to rest on when in service.  There is a different version of this tray for those walker without the upper crossbar.  This one won't work on most &#34;Drive&#34; brand walkers, but the other one (called the &#34;Pivot&#34;) probably will.
These help the bursitis in the elbows because they prevent you from accidentally hitting your elbow and feeling the pain.
i got this because my physical therapist used it to hold my knee cap inplace while I exercised and made the knee stronger. The cap had &#34;fallen off&#34; the track it is supposed to be on. The tape , lasting about 3 days even in showers etc, held strong and was placed below my knee cap as support and around under it.  Like a  lift.  Worked well, after 2-3 weeks of usage and changing every 3 days, the cap is in place now and no pain!
Best tongue scraper I have found, and the company is super nice!!  Would definitely purchase it again!
Not sure what kind of aliens we stole this material from but if you have an enamel tub and or tile shower (especially white), your first mission is to spray some tub cleaner and without letting it sit, wipe it with a wet Mr Clean eraser and prepare to be amazed!
I bought this for my husband and he raved about it! Uses it every day.
As expected, no concerns
It was a rainy windy day while I was loading my car with groceries from the cart.  The cart took a slow turn and rubbed against the entire length of my passenger side Audi!  There was a black line that stretched from back to front.  With light rubbing, this product removed the marks!  Thank goodness!
Strong, soft, perfect size for me
I thought these would be perfect for selecting my favorite sneakers and playing golf in them. You have to be careful what sneakers you use for this and anything with air bladders is NOT recommended due to puncturing and also your sneakers are design for a sure footed response with their current soles so when you add these cleats they can be very uncomfortable on your feet when the ground is hard and dry. Not so bad when it’s wet and soft. Overall. I lost more Than I would have liked and so I have to give these a clear thumbs down
good to add to my 1st aid kits
I travel and camp and this product makes life so much easier. I can clean clothes on the go and carry this in my pocket.
Works Great
when I make a mug of coffee, if I don't use powdered MCT oil, then I use this handy dandy convenient single serve MCT oil. I still get my kick for my coffee. It is an oil, and it doesn't emulsify that easily, but I just stir and drink and ignore any oil sitting on the top of my coffee.
Ok product low rating due to small loops on belt
It was good for a week and rthen it broke. My son plays soccer and has longer hair. He needed something to keep his hair out of his face and decided on these. He is 11 and they did fit well. The bad part was they started tearing after a week of use. We did try  and they worked much better. They are thicker and made from stretchable fabric. We like these much better.
This product has ingredients that support natural testosterone production and increase libido. The effects are noticeable, although I doubt my actual testosterone levels are increased significantly. The noticeable effects are more likely due to increased dopamine.Some of these ingredients you need to be careful of, specifically the L-Dopa and DHEA. Too much of these supplements can cause anxiety and aggression. To my knowledge Tribulus does nothing and it is the dominant ingredient. The pills have a funky smell, which is from the indole-3-carbinol. I3C coverts to DIM in your body, and DIM is in these as well, which is redundant.Another supplement that seems to work is D-Aspartic Acid, but this is a bulk powder not a pill.None of these easily-available supplements will have a huge impact on your testosterone levels compared to more powerful compounds that are harder to buy, but they should help slightly.The current price is $50, which is $0.83 per serving. You might only want to take one pill at a time instead of three.
Stable high quality stand for the pelvis and spine.  There was one review that said it was misleading because he thought it came with the pelvis.  If you have been shopping for skeleton models most models cost over 100 dollars.  This is a very good price for this stand.
This mct oil powder taste ok. It needs a few days to get used to it but eventually it works ok.
great product just as described and the same thing as in stores
just get it, not cheap but i see it as an investment on our health!
I cannot remember to take it as required so no results to report... but if this continues I will not re buy.  thanks!!!!!!!
Appreciate quality products delivered to my door.
These are not your typical gift bags - they are sturdy and can stand up to wear and tear. They are not made of paper so they can be re-used - in fact, if you're giving them out, your gift receipent can easily re-use them numerous times, so they are eco-friendly. I love how glittery they are and they come in a variety of colors - silver, gold, rose gold. I love how they look and they are ideal for gifting small items like jewelry. The only thing I didn't like was the gift tags - only one kind is offered, "Thank You." I wish they came with a variety of tags. As it is, they seem made only for "thank you" swag bag-type gifts.
still have cat probs, didn't work too good
Seems to do what it is supposed to do.
This is great. I am going to physical therapy right now for knee pain. The physical therapist uses one of these on my thighs and calves. Now I can do it from home (or have my husband help). I like the grips on this. They are very comfortable. The rollers are very smooth and don't balk. It's a perfect size for me to use on myself or for someone else to use on me. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
Another spontaneous purchase based on recommendation.Find it thoroughly useless.  Makes too much noise and after having it on for multiple days in a very small walk in closet, I saw no improvement in quality of air whatsoever.Thumbs down.
A great alternative than using bleach tablets.
My ability to put on some of my shoes is compromised by arthritis and other problems in my knees and back.  This product has made shoes I quit wearing now fully available on a daily basis.  This has been a fantastically useful tool for me when I want to wear shoes that do not have a stiff heel.
Case Is well made and safely stores heady glassware at a bargain price.
Trying to use to cut my own hair.  Didn’t work well.  Kept slipping.
O.k, so it's been 3 weeks and 4 days since I've been taking these breast pills. I am seeing a difference but not in cup size, I'm seeingfeeling a lot of firmness and more bounce.when I touch my boobs they fill like they got bigger but when I look at my before picture I don't see a difference in size but just straight firmness. I don't know, but I will purchase one more bottle and see if I see a difference. I mean if you want results you have to commit on taking them every day.I will for sure reveal the truth  to as if this product works.One thing I do hate are scammers. I will be your proof.All I know is that if this s*** don't work in a month I want my money back. Look for Luz Zuniga for me to keep you updated.
Love this product.  Received what was described and it worked perfectly.  I will definitely order again.
Using alcohol and salt works just as well
Material is a little cheap and unfortunately looks it. It's fine, but isn't the best looking. Like the ombre color, but that's a little cheap looking too.
Fits perfectly and I am a chunky gal. Holds the sensor in place. I thought the green would be more teal-ish, but it is a bright green. Not horrible though.
Now i can finally carry my E-pen with me and get to it fast, case is made very nice and durable, I love it
I have used this product for 20 years and it's awesome.  It's great for the "just got out of bed" look and the sexy "I didn't do anything to my hair to get it to look this cool" look.  And as I aged and my hair got thinner, the Tancho stick gave me the appearance of fuller, thicker hair.  It's one of the strongest hair waxes I've ever found.  The only thing I would change about this product is to have it without the lavender scent.  People have come to associate this smell with me and I no longer smell it.  However, if I had the choice I would rather not smell like anything.
This provided a nice relaxing bath. I personally prefer traditional lavender scents. This one smells more floral than lavender-y. It did bubble and fizz, which created  an inviting bath.
It's a straw and as long as liquid comes up it's good! Color is pretty too!
Fantastic cafe latte flavor, mixes up smoothly, tastes incredible! I was disappointed to find that this contains Sucralose, better known as Splenda, which I do not prefer to consume. But this tastes so good and packs enough of a nutritional punch I might overlook that! Very satisfying.---An hour later: woke up from a nap with a horrible taste in my mouth. Brushing my teeth won't get rid of it. Gaaah. The artificial sweetener in this otherwise tasty product is just not acceptable, which is really unfortunate. I wish they'd either left it unsweetened or used plain sugar.
Pros:I like the scentFeels like a high-quality oilI am able to sleep after using thisCons:Cannot think of any !!!
Could be just a tad larger.  I have a small face and they just fit.
I have been using the Skidmore products for years and have had only superb success with it. As an example, years ago I bought a butcher block dining room table. It had a natural light "oiled" finish. Something other than polyurethane. I got the "bright idea" that I should re-coat it with a popular semi-gloss polyurethane coating. What a disaster. It looked ok for a few months then went downhill from there. Probably something I did in error during application to be honest. After looking at it for years I sanded off the poly and phoned the ownerinventor of the product who is more than willing to give one on one advice that is very nice. Got simple instructions and I followed them. Now the table literally looks BETTER than the day I bought it. This is great stuff for sure. And, a little goes a long way too. I am absolutely not a carpenter or cabinet maker, but this product makes me look like one. You can't go wrong as long as you read and follow the instructions. My highest recommendation!
My daughter has some blood sugar issues that seem to be resulting in dry mouth. This toothpaste has made a difference.
this is a quick and efficient way to get rid of stains.  It works very, very well.
Great value and really nice sponge that has substance to it, not just a piece of netting tied together.
My wife uses it as our white noise machine for sleeping. We hadhave a previous model that is about 15 years old. My better half was afraid that it would die any day now. Knowing that she could not make it through the night without her machine, we had to order a backup...We love it.
I ordered a few mini snaps by mistake and was going to return them but decided to maybe get something to go with them.  This bracelet is perfect!  I have the large snap necklace so I have started collecting mini and large snaps.
I am very pleased with this sponge. The price is excellent. The only issue I have is that it doesn't seem to lay the makeup into my skin as well as brushes or fingers. I do not contour, I just wanted something that would apply foundation faster than a brush. It's really easy to keep it clean and sanitary. I would do 4.5 stars if I could. I gave one to a friend and they are pleased.
All of the liquid liposomal vitamin C products that I've reviewed have all had a strong flavor - not bad but some people might like to dilute in water or something. I take it straight out of the bottle but the sweetened citrus flavoring is strong. I most definitely prefer a liposomal form of vitamin C whether it's capsules or liquid. Liposomal vitamin C stays in your system much longer than the water soluble ascorbic acid which is excreted quickly by the body. Liposomal means the ascorbic acid is wrapped in a fat blanket (sunflower oil) and is therefore carried much further and longer in your system fighting cold and flu viruses. This bottle of liposomal vitamin C is nearly the same as all the others I've reviewed so there's a lot of them to choose from. I can find nothing negative to say about this liquid liposomal vitamin C.
I like these bath bombs they actually smell like cotton candy  really beautiful coloring in the bath water🙂
Would not recommend, this are about as cheap of quality as I have ever seen in reading glasses.  Broke the first day,
Excellent blood pressure monitor. No more spending money on batteries.  Charges quickly. Accurate like the battery operated monitors. Great price too. Very pleased.
Very good results with a pleasant scent.  There are so many biting insects here at this time of the year when the monsoons are present.  Am not outside all day long as it is raining, but while I am there and using this Avon product, the insects stay away.  I can actually sit and watch the hummingbirds without being bothered!!  I am pleased with this lotion and have purchased a second one.  Would recommend.
This stuff is great! Way better than any other brand even oxiclean! highly recommend!
It is a little hard to explain the feeling after using this. It suppressed coughing for momentarily. I didn't use it long enough to say it provided long-lasting results. My package came disheveled. The salt package was open, and salt was everywhere. There was a tiny crack on the bottom of the inhaler. Watch out for that! I contacted Amazon, and they refunded my money right away.
Not as good as the Aquacel Extra AG, but these are MUCH less expensive and work just fine on their own. Save the super pricey ones for MRSA and stuff.
I started seeing a podiatrist about six months ago for horrible plantar fasciitis. I purchased these Powerstep ProTech insoles from his office for about $50. These are the same ones I got at his office, and they are less than half the cost!These are firm, and great to add to any pair of shoes. It's important to note that they are covered in fabric, which will wear if you wiggle your toes inside your shoes, or if you put extra weight on one side. My doctor said I would need to replace my insoles in one year; I've actually needed a new pair for about two months.So, I'm glad I've found these. I recommend getting properly fitted for the correct size, and getting a proper diagnosis from a podiatrist, as no insole is for every foot. But I'm pretty happy. I will definitely order these again.
This product actually works.. I don't have back issues, I am 130lbs and I do commercial construction. I use to come home, most of the nights with an achy back, working plus wearing a tool belt, with this product I haven't had an achy back besides when I don't wear this product and it's also half way decent. It's a bit bulky but to save the lower back it's worth the sweat
Where has this been all of my life?! This thing is awesome! I used it tonight for the first time and it got all of my blackheads. I first washed my face, then used a hot wash cloth to open my pores, then powered on the vacuum on the lowest speed and tada - nose, chin and forehead is smooth and soft. I recommend this to anyone who has larger pores andor trouble with blackheads. You don't need to spend tons of money on one of these, this one is decently priced and does the job effectively. Great purchase!
Great quality and price
Do you have extra energy for the Holidays? Looking to spend that energy in a special way that'll put you on Santa's naughty list? Well look no further than this lovely toy thats great for all levels of enthusiasts!First off, the toy comes in a standard Amazon box. Once you open it up, it's right there, and it's not too discreet. So if you're not living alone, be sure to try to get the mail first when it comes. Granted the packaging on the outside doesn't let others know what may really be inside.Once you've got your toy unwrapped, you're going to want to wash it off first with some warm water to get it heated for some play. Also, it's important to note you'll need to already have some water-based lube on hand as sadly the packaging didn't come with any.Getting your toy ready for some play is as simple as applying a generous amount of lube to both orifices, and then a healthy amount to yourself. What you'll first notice even sticking your fingers inside of this toy is that it is beautifully textured inside. Various bumps, ridges, and ribs will make sure from the first penetration, and to the heavy pumping in, and out will feel amazing in all the right places.After you hit your high note, and you're finished, clean up is as simple as step one. Wash your toy out with warm, soapy water, and leave to air dry. You may even want to put on a bit of corn starch to leave it super fresh, and ready for use the next time you want to have a go at it.Overall for the price point this toy is wonderful for anyone whose curious about owning their own special humping hole for the holidays. Or if you're bold enough, and want a good paper weight on your desk. this lovely eye piece will catch anyones attention as it sits near you. Believe me, you'll want that weight cause it feels great sinking down on you. This'll also make a fun gift for a friend that'll sure to make them blush in front of a crowd too if you're looking to embarrass somebody. I'm looking forward to using this toy quite often, and I'm happy I have it in my own personal collection for when I've got extra energy to burn over the holidays to keep myself busy. Thanks for reading!
This is a very cute item with a lot of great potential.  The trees are adorable and made very well.  The little clothes pins are so cute and come with one for each tree, so there are no extras in case you lose one.  It comes with burlap string so some assembly is required.  The lettering is good, but not perfect.  The last letter s is coming off on my set, and some of the letters are glued onto the trees a little crooked.  The good thing was that while unpacking the trees, they were in order, so it was easy to assemble the words Merry Christmas quickly and easily.
This set is Made in China and does not have specific brand labeling.  So it could be sold as any brand.  For that reason, you’ll want to look around to see who is offering the best price.  I find the current price of twenty-four bucks to be quite expensive for plastic rods and brushes Made in China.The instructions show that you will probably want to use duct tape to secure each section together after you screw them together.  This  is certain true, as sections could unscrew as your working the brush back-and-forth. . . especially if using a drill.You may also wish to use super glue (or some other glue) to attach the brush head so that it does come unscrewed.The rods are not that flexible.  The more rods you attach, then the more curved it can become. . . but. . if you that some “tight turns”, then this may not work.This set comes with two brushes.  The bristles are a good combination of flexible  stiff.  The  brush is 4-inches across, and about 1.75” wide.  The brushes must be used separately, and can to be attached together.I wish that someone would invent a dryer vent cleaner where you could attach some kind of hose to a vacuum cleaner.  Because once you use such a brush. . .  you’re going to have to get the lint out.  If you have such a hose, then you could possible attach it to this brush  pole set.
Great curling iron
Smells nice but total ripoff $7.99 for a 2.5oz....when you can get a 7oz bottle for a dollar more. My fault should've read teh description. PLUS the picture with all the bottles is misleading, you would think you were getting 6-7 mini cans for $7.99.. But again my fault..
This is the best product ever made for mosquitoes and flying insects!
Over the years, I have tried all sorts of conditioners, creams, serums,  sprays, & everything new that comes out.  I am finished searching for the perfect repair serum. This natural repair serum answers all of my problems. Frizz control & shine is important to me! I  also color my hair so this serum helps with the dryness. My hair looks shiny & healthy. I love to read through the ingredients of natural oils. I actually have heard of the oils! And I have used the oils before. To have these oils all together in one easy to use serum is great! I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  This bottle will last quite a long time & I'll let my friends try it also. Thank You!
I use a lot of stain removers. I have a puppy, an older dog and older husband and myself. We are all stain collectors. For me, just fixing a mug of coffee will result in coffee on my clothing. A nice amount. And if we go out to eat, I will surely get something that falls on me from the transportation with a spoon or fork. My husband always spills his food. The dogs leave stains all over the furniture and the floor - especially the puppy. He is about all done with going in the house, but I don't trust him to always go in the back to go potty. So, we have stain removers and use them darn near every wash.
this all around and only muffles slightly
Other than the color, I love it!  Really helps with pain
I have purchased Professor Amos drain cleaner for years.  It has always worked.  I may have to use more than one treatment, but it will clear your drain.
Good product smells like curry
It's so much nicer to take a shower with a scrubber brush like this one. It's really soft and feels amazing. It's really easy to.hold onto even when wet. It's soft bristles provide a nice soft scrubbing massage to get derp down dirt off from skin. The ability to reach hard to reach places makes it feel like you have superhuman stretchability. Great value
This is an OK performing toilet anti-odor spray. The scent is rather weak compared with other similar sprays I've used, but it is reasonably strong. It's a generic floral scent -- not all that different from a general air freshener type of scent, but not bad. It's certainly better than the odor it helps mitigate.As with other similar sprays, you need to use it before the toilet is used for maximum effectiveness. It has limited benefits if used after the toilet is used. A fair amount is needed (4 or 5 sprays) for good results.Compared with other similar products this is not as potent, and just an average value at best. Three stars.
Great buy HOWEVER note the expiration date on the are nearing much sooner than if you buy direct from dr gundry himself, which is probably why its cheaper to buy on amazon. (says good for use upto 2 years beyond manufacturers expiration)
We needed this little battery for our security system.  Could not find it anywhere.  Price is reasonable and I will be reordering more soon.  If anyone needed this type of battery I would recommend this Panasonic as it does last very long!  We also changed out the battery in our fire alarms as it is very important to make sure your fire alarms are working for your safety!
This is the best! I will buy more when I run out.
Looks exactly how it’s pictured.A little pricey but it’s nice!
I bought this shower bench to be able to shave my legs or sit to take a shower when sick. It looks great in my shower, is the correct height for shaving legs and very sturdy.
Just needed the clip but it does not open
Great toothbrush. Soft. My dog tolerated it very well.
These are nice files for the price. They file well, leave nails feeling smooth, and they're WASHABLE! I've had them a few months now and my file hasn't dulled or lost strength. Excellent purchase!
I bought two of these. I have an expensive one at home and needed something smaller and less money for work and for when I travel. Though it may not be "as powerful" as my expensive one at home, it does the job. I keep the one at work in a cosmetic bag, with toothpaste, toothbrush and a small mouthwash and it's perfect to tote to the restroom after lunch and keeping my teeth clean. The other is in my travel cosmetic case, so when I go out of town - I just charge it up and off I go. For $9.99, you can't beat the price.
I'm a big fan of generic stuff, including tissues. UNTIL I actually have a cold and then I want the real deal - Kleenex. These are just softer and smoother with no shedding compared to the off brands. Sneezing or just a runny nose means lots of tissues and these do not make your nose sore. This 8 box batch means we can keep them handy in every room.
It is what a expected. Scent isn’t very strong but it coats well and does the job. Keep it in plastic bag so it doesn’t  dry out. Glad to not be buying plastic throw always. Will buy again but waiting to see how long this will last so far good over a few weeks.
Order the ones for fingers and toes, got the ones for toes only.  Returning!
I need the natural skin healing for my eczema spots that will itch and be noticeable if I didn't have clothes over them, but then you have to itch through your clothing. I can use this on my face for the scales and also on my body. Double duty! Smells good too.
I really like these wipes. They're small (I keep a package in my car) and work great to clean up your face or other parts. Not just for kids : )
Don't waste your money. If looked great when I received it but it won't fit on any of my cabinets.
I didn’t really know what I was getting into. I’ve been discovering all sorts of new beauty and health tools - mostly good - and was especially excited to see this might help my hair. I didn’t really know what I was getting into here. Thankfully, I read the instruction manual before starting and saw the warning about using this if you have metallic implants. I messaged Eternal Clear and received a speedy response that it was safe to use this as long as I stayed 1.5” away from my metal rods. Yay!So I had already noted that everything arrived safely, neatly boxed and sealed. I was worried the bulbs were defective at first because they didn’t light up right away. I wasn’t even sure if they were supposed to, but I persisted and eventually they all lit up. I don’t know if it was a coincidence, but one finally lit up when I moved my hand closer toward it. They all seemed to light up much easier after the first time. The electric buzzing and smell is kind of scary, but as soon as I was told I could proceed, I plucked up the courage to try this on the lowest setting. I’m not even sure it was a setting because there’s a pretty wide range between on and where the dots indicating intensity start. I’m slowly working on getting used to the sounds, smells, and feel first. I found the dial easy to turn. I’m proceeding cautiously but optimistically.
My favorite of all the Wen I tried.
Very difficult to use. Very hard to get out of the tube. A caulking gun would have been easier!
Very thin ...does not feel the same as brand name
Look no more red nose! But, no more money for the love of tissues please
easy to install and easy to clean...good value
I have ordered these twice and really like the soft packaging.  It is perfect for the car and any other place in the house. The quality is great and the price is great.
A little confusing to maneuver.
Bought the dog-themed matches for friends; bought these matches for myself.  Cute.The matches themselves are low quality but the dressed-for-success cats are purrrfect (meow).
My son loves it! Good taste!!!
I initially was concerned after opening the package when I realized that this device is intended for the outflow port from an HVAC system. While many people have the "VAC" portion of the HVAC system, my house is equipped just with the "HV" - Heating and ventilation.After looking at my setup a bit and pondering, I reached out to the manufacturer, mammoth, and asked for some guidance on installing into my system.After sending some pictures back and forth we came up with a good solution to attach the unit to the sidewall of one of the heating unit which would purify anything entering into the system.The quality of the parts are great - the lights give a satisfying sound when connecting to their receptors, and the status lights that indicate when it is safe to service the equipment or not are a great added benefit.The included template for cutting into your system is very important, as without it this task would be substantially harder.
Great item, cleans your contacts really good
Item as described. Good cleaning item.
I love this product as a night moisturizer. Takes a jiffy to get the amount right but it is so absorbable it’s really not an issue. Think you will love it.
Makes good party joints, almost two ZigZag papers long.  Too long for my daily use, and no extra belt like the smaller RAW rollers, but a fine machine none the less.  Colorado approved.
This set has all the basic scents to get you started. You can use the different scents and blend them to make your own scent to have in your home. Many people use these in the humidity type diffuser and others use the diffuser that does not use water. I don't use water and I get some times scents in my home.
Great Product.
Bought for a xmas present and she loves them!
the rice was delicious.
Super cute and be warned that these are a bit time consuming to put together but well worth the time!
Now is a great time to take care of your immune system. It helps you fight off everything from colds and flu to cancer. These gummies taste great. They have a blend of elderberry, propolis and echinacea. They're all known to boost immune function. The gummies are very easy to take and are soft and chewy. I highly recommend this product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
Indoor air quality has become of the utmost importance these days. Most people want to do everything they can to keep their homes safe. This gadget is a novel approach. It uses UV-C light to sanitize the air in your home via the HVAC system. It's something that can be used in combination with an air filter to improve the air quality in your home. The unit is small and easy to install. The bulbs can be replaced when they die. I think this is an excellent invention. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.
Worked twice second time wouldn't even come on for five minutes so it really worked once. Then no lights no heat MADE IN CHINA garbage!  In the process of moving I don't have a printer to return so this is beyond inconvenient and with a stiff neck. Running to print labels and return. Second time this week.I guess I'm just frustrated with being the best nation on the earth and having the crappiest products on the planet because of China and the terribke deals we have made in this county. I'm done shopping online because of this
This is a really cool-looking shaver! My son is into skulls and thinks this is the neatest thing ever. He says all of the shaving and trimming functions work quite well, which was a bit unexpected for a seemingly novelty device. But, when it comes to the brushes they don't clip into the base and stay there. Therefore, once turned on, they can fall out at any time. The instructions do say to attach the brushes, place them against your face, and then turn the shaver on. So, maybe they are just held on by pressure. The instruction booklet is a good size and readable, which is a plus in my book.Aside from the brushes not snapping into the shaver as all the other attachments do, this shaver looks cool and also functions very well. I would definitely recommend it, especially for skull lovers and teenage boys just starting out shaving. 4 stars ✨
Great teeth & gums supplement.  After only 4 days use my gums are pink & redness has cleared up. I like the clove taste & numbing effect. Teeth feel stronger & set firm in gums too! They seem to be whiter even tho I drink coffee & tea. Yay!! 😁
I was expecting a three pack from the picture....note to self: always read what is included, especially since this indicated 90 capsules and that is what I got. I got to this review too late in the day to try it. But tomorrow morning...watch out. I am back and it is the next day. I took the diet capsule and now waiting to see if it curbs my appetite.
Flavor is the first criteria I review when reviewing energy drinks, and I have reviewed a lot of them.  It's still too much on the sweet side but almost all of them are.  I don't know why they have to be so sweet, I usually add limelemon juice to them to cut the sweet.  That said, I play two hard sets of singles yesterday in the hot sun and had my water bottle filled with this energy booster.  I felt o.k. for the most part. Playing in the sun really saps my energy so knowing that I was still going pretty strong towards the end of the match tells me this stuff must be helping.
This is basically a heated pad with a removable shield to keep the heat in. It looks like carpet in the pictures, but it's a plastic like material. That's not a bad thing since it's easy to wipe off, but I wanted to note that it's not a soft carpet. The heat is concentrated in the center of the mat but my feet stay warm on the edges too with the shield on. It's a welcome addition to my chilly office.
From what I have heard described about other rolling machines of this type, they break easily.  This one, which is made of hemp plastic, I am sure, will last a very long time, and it's very easy to use.Love it!
This double sided brush is decent for dogs- my only issue is that after a few weeks the bristles start coming out- it is not a very durable brush.
Steps are clearly numbered and stated on the items so there is no confusion or mistakes. Best I have owned
Was hesitant to buy cordless, as my other cordless (esp. for cats) didn't cut through mats easily.  By the time I pulled his hair 2 or 3 times he bit showing his irritation...and then I was irritated too.  This Holdog cordless Pet Hair Clipper came today and my cat was been quickly dematted.  It had a 60% charge and I waited a couple minutes to get 100% (charged very quickly).  I LOVE the LCD display.  The blade was easy to take off and reassemble, so I oiled and cleaned the clipper before and after use.  This time I got a kitty kiss.  We are both happy. Love it.  And for the price, amazing.
Took care of arm pain (nerves) that was result of shingles.  Was able to go to sleep.
Good cotton balls, used mainly for removing nail polish.  They held together well.
Worked great!
Didn't mean to order this, but I'm glad I did. Works as advertised. I like that it folds around my straighter too. Chi approved:)
This package came with two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam ear plugs. One sleep mask is black on both sides and the other has purple on one side and black on the other.  The fabric is smooth and soft against the skin. The elastic band that holds the mask on is doubled over and is adjusted by sliding the fastener (rather than with a bulky snap or velco closure). I find this closureadjustment method more comfortable than my current sleep mask. The mask is thick enough to block light, and the mask does narrow (as in, has a "cut out") in the nose area for a somewhat better fit. But there is no molding or pillowed area to hold the mask above your eyes or fill the gap created between the cheek and the nose, so light does get under the mask. The mask lies directly against my eyelashes, and I don't really care for that. The stitching is neat.The mask measures 8.5" across by 4" high (or 3.5" high where it dips up at the nose area). The elastic can be adjusted between about 8" to 15" of length, for a total mask + elastic length of 16.5" to 23.5".
This smells different than their other dreft I've got in the past and I love the update. It smells so good and not too intense. The box reduces plastic waste and is recyclable, easier and more convenient to use than a pour plastic bottle. Just a warning to turn and open the spout slow because it will come out fast if not. I've been using this on our daughters clothes and cloth diapers and it cleans very well and makes everything smell great!
I can't tell you how much I appreciate the wide flat bases of these Ziplocs! I like to make ahead and freeze meals, and it's often awkward to fill them without someone else holding them open. These stand up by themselves, and make it so much easier! Love them!
As many others have said, these are 2 oz cups. They’re also poorly packaged - just shrink wrapped so at least a dozen are crushed or otherwise damaged.Pity because they’re a cute pattern. Might keep, haven’t decided yet.
This is a great quality brush that I got to make the difficult  job of straightening my daughters hair.  Now it is a little less of a chore for us both. This is easy to use and does a nice job in half the time and alot less fuss from my child. It can be a bit of a problem when she wants to play and not sit to have it taken care of for any length of time. This is a nice way to get her hair done quickly and painlessly so we are both happy. It works so well and does a great job. It gets hot fast which is great no one wants to sit waiting. The handle stays cool so I don't have to worry about my hand burning while I am doing her hair. The controls are easy to use and the directions explained everything thoroughly. The screen is easy to read. Her hair brushed right through and it didn't take long for it to look smoother and straight. This is a great brush that does a good job I am so glad I found it.I was given this brush in exchange for an honest review.
No instructions. I have no clue what those handle things are for. However I did use The stickies to keep the balloons holding together and the long ballon holder.
I've purchased for international S. America and Vietnam travel.  When it pours the lotion separates from the insect oil and I have a tough time getting to two to meld.
This product made my wife's legs go numb.
My wife has major knee issues.  I purchased this and installed per instructions.  If you're a handy man type, this will pose no problem for the installation.  The white color matched the white porcelain of the toilet.  The base of the Toto Drake is longer than Toilevator's 22.3 inch length and extends off the platform 1 inch in the back.  It doesn't effect stability.  I know it can hold just over 300 lbs. without structural failure, in the 2 months we have had it.I purchased the item because there were no ADA or otherwise round toilets available 3.5" taller than the Drake and this Toto has been great operationally and for longevity of parts.  With the Toilevator's 3.5" lift, I kept my original toilet, and my wife's knees are much easier to extend when she stands up.  I was rather concerned about the weight, but it said 500 lbs. was the limit.  It has proved sound.  It has been easy to clean.  The toilet hasn't shifted or slid on the base.  The bolts extended higher than the top of the Toto toilet base.  I just purchased a deep cap rather than cut them.  All needed items are in the kit, except for the deeper bolt cap covers.  I also needed a new bowl gasket (seals the tank to the bowl) as I took off the tank to make handling much easier for me.****The only issue for me were the closet bolts that were supplied (These connect the toilet base and the Toilevator to the sewer flange at the floor).  The heads of the bolts were round, not flat, and appeared to be galvanized.  They should be stainless steel.  They would not fit under the flange.  I simply ground the head and sides down a bit till they fit, and applied plumbers grease to the threads to prevent the bolt and nut becoming rusted together.  Years of experience have taught me to think ahead.......
These insoles are made from EVA. They are not as durable and give less cushioning than insoles made from polyurethane. The insoles I received were much larger than my shoes, so I had to trim them down which is a hassle compared to insoles that are properly sized.
Very comfortable and soft
I love the glitter! The mask is comfortable and light enough so it's not overwhelming. I wear it to my doctor's appointments if they are not virtual. Anywhere I need to go it is appropriate. And cute!!
3 years later, there is a leak.
Fit my device and now I can charge it, woohoo!
*Review after one week of use: had some doubts that this would work as well as stated for the incredible task  at hand - a laundry room that is the nighttime spot for 3 dogs. Every morning we open the door and gasp at the horror of the stench. A good thorough mopping might clean the floor but the air is rank with stinky dog that no aerosol air freshener can conquer. Plugged this in as soon as it arrived and within an hour, it was pleasant. Even when the pack comes in wet, it has made a big difference. Now to see how long it lasts.***UPDATE After a month, the dogs are winning. It no longer clears out the smell the way it did in the beginning. If my laundry room were bigger, I'd purchase another larger unit like the one we use for the whole house, maybe that would work. For now, we might just have to invest in face masks.
I got these to wear to my chemo time. They are super soft around the eyes, they wrap around and velcro keeping the maximum amount of light out so I can sleep. I am so very happy I found these. My friend recommended a memory foam style and I never thought of it. So I was excited to buy them. Overall, great comfort, great sleep quality and very soft on eyes. I highly recommend these to anyone.
These Innocheer 24&#34; Wind Chimes with S Hook are literally music to my ears. I love the sound that they make. I moved them earlier today on my front porch so that they would be closer to my bedroom. They sound like Christmas music to me and such a pretty sound at that.I would buy again.
I did not attend my expectations.  It did not make my feet smooth at all.  The motor sounds very cheap.  I'm in the process of returning this product.
This really gives a nice stretch.  I use it on my office chair daily.  Ever since I started using this the lower back pain I would have at the end of the day is gone.
We are big fans of this flavor and the coconut. Wish they were less expensive but they aren’t.
I use this form of curcumin more for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (neuro protective). Having said this, I also find it to be an excellent anti-inflammatory.
These are great.  Best I found so far.
This is the biggest piece oh shiiiiiiii I ever bought ! It does not even work
I love that this has a sturdy stand and wheels. They roll very easy. The drying power is very good. It dries up rather than down which I think dries the hair faster. It was easy to assemble. Very professional type dryer.
Great nail file.  The &#34;sand&#34; doesn't rub off.  This is good quality.
Saw one bottle sitting on a shelf, bought it to try out since I get dry mouthed at night but don’t want to drink anything. This worked well and I just ordered 3 more bottles.
I've only taken it about 4 days and can already tell the difference.  Thank you.
Nice product, but over priced, I found it at a big box store for half the price.
Reading all these reviews and they look and read like the SAME reviewer....🤔 don't ya think? Strange .... so....be cautious.
Cannot get the protector off the brush, GOING TO HAVE TO SEND IT BACK..
The first time I ordered these I fell in love with them because they where perfect for work but this second time around I found it be a different type of glove as if they changed the product .it felted and a different color
I LOVE these bars!  They are a bit chewy and can get really hard if they're cold, but I still give them 5 stars bc they are one of the best egg free paleo bars on the market.
My posture is excellent--everyone says so. (smile) Including multiple physical therapists. But, I began to have some irritation in my clavicle collar bone area, and a new curved car seat back was killing me. Combined ... just awful. This gentle posture corrector helps hold my shoulders back. That's retraining my back muscles and relieving both issues. It's easy to don and very adjustable. Comfortable. Remember, only 30 minutes at a time--especially to start.
I love these nail files as they are the only ones that I will use.  Thank you so much.
I bought hoping to block husband snoring, which didn’t help well with that.  But took with me on a plane ride and it work amazing keeping light from overhead plus helped with using to try to rest.
That strap on the back really makes masks stay on better and feel more comfortable, but the little cup insert thing didn’t really work for me. I think you have to have a much smaller than average nose, and I’m not sure this is designed for Americans. Also, it doesn’t really stay in place. But the straps and lanyard thing or useful. The rest? Depends on your face.That strap on the back really makes masks stay on better and feel more comfortable, but the little cup insert thing didn’t really work for me.

Better then 3.00 dollars a box
Taste nothing like salted caramel it is nasty tasting and I have tasted way better flavors of whey then this. I am a caramel fanatic when I am looking for a good whey that doesn't have hidden sugars and was disappointed that I spent 50 flats on something I expected a way better taste. I have to down this drink pretty fast because it's not anything I can discribe. Just not caramel of any means. Don't waste your money Extend has a better flavor then this brand of carmel and you get way more for your money.
Its heavy duty, works well in the kitchen, any surfaces that needs cleaning
These suffice for the small amounts of trash I generate. The size is good for small to med waste cans. The price was right and delivery was fast. They do tear easily if heavy or sharp objects are put in.
I filled up the soap container and it was very hard to squeeze it out, so I just put the soap on the brush and showered that way! I like the brush part, soft and felt like it was getting the dry skin off, but didn’t like the fact that the liquid soap was hard to squeeze out, it is okay, but not as easy as it says in the ad..... I bought the three pack so I won’t be buying it again...
Like the title says, I stuck them to the back of a pair of boots with worn soles to restore traction.  There was a maximum area for the pad to adhere, and I carefully cleaned and *slightly* roughened the area to maximize its ability to stick.After just a single wear the pads were starting to come off, and after 2 they were completely gone.  While they were cheap, they were a total waste of money.
Maca Powder is a superfood from Peru. You can mix some of the powder in your smoothies and you can also add some to your baking. It is good for giving you endurance. It is very nutritious but also has 20 grams of carbohydrates per serving.
We have several similar products in the house.  During this Covid19 we try to take our vitamins and stay hydrated.  This is a very nice item to have around.  My wife and I are actually both drinking one now.My biggest complaint is the salty taste.  I know, I know it has salt for electrolytes but my other main one we drink doesn't have this salty taste.  I just chugged half the bottle and then refilled it with cold water.  I like it better when it is diluted.  Next time I will just use 12 of one tube in my bottle of water.I do appreciate the vitamins and will continue to use this.
I really like the idea of this device. The vibrations themselves are soothing. But because I purchased this to help with long haul covid issues (which stem, to my understanding, at issues with nervous system regulation), I didn’t consider the fact that one of my symptoms is scalp pain. And when I’m experiencing the scalp pain, the location of this device can be somewhat aggravating. In addition, I had a hard time getting it to rest comfortably behind my ears. It had a tendency to move off of my left ear in particular. I’m not sure if it’s not as suited to certain headear shapes.I did find the vibrations to be comforting, but it was offset by the discomfort of the pressure on my head (aggravated by long haul scalp pain and proclivity to headaches).Another issue was that, for a product like this; I would like to use it more than 2x a day. One charge lasts about 4 sessions, so it requires frequent recharging if you want to use it more regularly. And also, using it more regularly, I felt more discomfort from the pressure on my headears. So not an ideal device for frequent use.I only ended up using it a few days before deciding to return. I really like the idea, and I did enjoy the sensation of the vibration, but it wasn’t well-suited for my needs at this time.
LOVE IT. so fresh and coconut is wonderful
If you know and love Sangre de Grado, this is a good one.
Supplements were a great deal, cheaper than the local nutrition store.  Plan to order again in the future.  No complaints at all but just so everyone knows, Amino Acids taste TERRIBLE!  They also give you terrible breathe while you're eatingdrinking it.  Just a heads up, I wasn't aware of this until after I started them.
I have only used the high heel pad for the front of my feet. And they were amazing. So comfortable. Heels that I couldnt wear for more than an hour. I wore all night.
These are the best nail files and buffers to use. I am a nail tech and I always use these files since I can clean them after I am done using them and put them in my clients individual tool containers. Love them. A must buy. Make sure you prep the edges of the files before using them on your clients or on your self since you can cause cuts since they are sharp.
Although not the most durable, it did the job.  But if you plan on mailing items using this, I wouldn't get this.  If it's just for gifts that you will transport locally or at your home then it does a decent job.
My right foot has a bunion growing bigger and have been looking for something to help ease the pain. This bunion corrector does okay but by it being so squishy, it isn't really correcting anything. All it does is provide a cushion between my big toe and second toe. I've turned it go horizontal between my toes and that seems to help better. Still on a hunt to find something other than surgery to correct it.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Probiotics are important for digestion and immune health,  but they can get pricey.  These are reasonably priced and seem to work the same as my regular brand.
Pain in my limbs have greatly lessened  from taking this.  I can finally enjoy walking again.
Very impressed with this stop and squat foot stool. It is made of great quality plastic that is sturdy and has a decent weight to it. It is great for people who are shorter than 6 feet and really uncomfortable for someone taller. I am 5'5&quot; and it works great for me. My significant other is 6'1&quot; and finds it really hard to use. It allows me to have a productive bowel movement, and it takes some adjusting for your intestines to understand what is going on lol but I am happy with it and recommend to those who want to have a BM the way man was supposed to have it. There is a gap in the middle for you to line it up evenly in front of the toilet. Great bathroom experience nonetheless.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.
I've used it twice on wet feet and it works perfectly at getting dead skin off and smoothing .
NIftalicious!!!
Ok. Doesn't straighten curly hair completely.
Love these things; can't live without them.  Others have posted they don't work, but it takes at least a couple months of constant use to get the full benefit; I've tried many other tabs for my joints, and will not go back to anything else; these make me able to move and not be in such constant knee pain.
I love this, my son is autistic and so it is a great sensory bath toy for him, he loves to hold it and feel it, its really flexible as well and he likes when I rub his back with it, a great buy!
According to the manufacturer, "Fresh Aid Toothpaste is packed with quality ingredients that target gum diseases like gingivitis and plaque. It prevents tooth decay and gum and tooth pain. It's also the best toothpaste for those with sensitive teeth and gums."This toothpaste has ginger root extract, which I can taste and may partially account for the tingling sensation that stays on after you rinse your mouth out. The toothpaste has a yellowish color and kind of reminds me of lemon filling. It leaves your mouth feeling fairly clean but there is a lightness to this toothpaste that other white and chalky toothpastes (like Crest) don't have.I question whether the lack of fluoride will be effective in the long-term at protecting my recessed gums and preventing plaque from taking hold. I usually use Colgate Total, so only time will tell if this toothpaste will be as effective. I have been brushing it now for only a week, so I will update this review if anything changes. For now, it's an OK toothpaste for those who are concerned with the amount of chemicals in their toothpaste. Because of my gum issues, effectiveness is more of a priority for me, so if you have overall healthy teeth and gums, you may love it.
This product is easy to use and leaves my granite countertops very shiny and looking great.  It also has a nice clean smell.  Simply spray it on and rub with a dry cloth.  The can lasts a very long time and it is a great value.
Just like all the other comments that I did not listen to the liquid will never go through this tube! It won’t work.
This is a very nice, modern scale.  It take 4 AAA batteries and were easily installed in the scale.  This is a very nice scale and it looks great in my bathroom.  Love the glass.  Seems to be accurate when it comes to weighing on it.  Overall I am very satisfied with this scale.  It has met my expectations and does not look cheap.I received this scale for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to this conclusion by using the scale myself.
My family constantly has problems with ear wax build up. It seems like I'm constantly cleaning them. I got this product in hopes of making it a little less scary than scooping it out. It does an okay job.  I think I need to work with it more to figure it out.  Bottle worked as advertised.
Seems to put more of a strain on the Oral B .to move the brushes ,than the factory Brushes.  I think I well go backto the Oral B.
I've been using the Aria for about a month now and I'm really pleased with it. I like that it takes a new measurement every time you step on. I've had some scales in the past that didn't seem to budge unless you lost or gained a pound or two, and sometimes that big jump was quite unwelcome. It measures quickly, identifies me and syncs right to my Fitbit account immediately. I was initially concerned because the bathroom that it is located in has the worst wifi connection in my whole house, but so far I haven't missed a single reading on it.The bodyfat % definitely does fluctuate, but as I'm familiar with other devices that measure bodyfat I also know that things as simple as whether your stomach is empty or full and how dehydrated you are can cause this to fluctuate quite a bit. The percentage itself might not be extremely accurate, but if you weigh yourself at the same time and under similar circumstances daily (ie. first thing in the morning before you've eaten or had anything to drink), then it is accurate enough to let you know whether your percentage is increasing or decreasing over time. This isn't a professional bodyfat measuring tool, and it's unreasonable to expect it to work as well as one.I'm the only one currently using my scale so I can't comment on the difficulties some people have with multiple users or guest users. Setting it up was extremely simple and now I don't have to wonder if I remembered to log my weight in my Fitbit account or not. In fact now I can't do things like &#34;forget&#34; to log my weight after a rough weekend. I like to know where I'm at on my journey so I don't find myself avoiding getting on the scale to avoid having the weight logged, which I was actually worried about. Overall it has just become a comfortable part of my routine and caused me to have to be a bit more accountable to myself. I'm quite happy with my Aria.
I have been using it and has a nice flavor. Very effective
Given as a gift. Much appreciated and comfy for patient.
It was a gift they loved it
NO! Do Not use Magic Erasers on anything! I can't believe they are even still selling any of these things. They serve no purpose and will damage anything they touch. If you care about the surface you are about to clean, keep these things away or the surface WILL be damaged.
These adult diapers are soft and comfortable to wear, also quite absorbent.  My only issue is that the cute design looks like baby diapers.
not the same as the picture
This are super colorful great gift giving holiday bags and tags. I always give smaller gifts to neighbors (sometimes home made baked goods, sometimes a bottle of wine). These bags are perfect for this. The drawstring is made of ribbon and seals the bag well. These would also be great for packaging teacher's gifts or for family gifting. Highly recommend. Nice variety, nice colors!
Fits great
I love this pillbox with Fox Hunt theme
In the clouds! God Bless : )
Returned it.  didn't work for me
I just can't seem to wear any other type of nose pads than these self-adhesive soft pads. I have tried at least 5 or 6 other kinds and I always come back to these. They are so much more comfortable on the nose and I have a very small nose bridge. These come in different colors and have been the only ones worth the expense!
I like these bags. They do clear odors in  enclosed spaces.
I am not going to be ugly - but this was the worse 9.00 I have spent and that is all I have to say about it.
I've bought several of these kits, and I finally figured out why this isn't working for me. A lot of the breakfasts and lunches are very sugary bars, which later make me feel like I'm starving - I think it's the sugar. For one thing, a granola bar, in my opinion, is a pretty lousy breakfast or lunch. Not very filling, and not much nutrition. Then after you eat these, you crash from the sugar high and are starving. I ended up eating eggs on the days that I was supposed to have the bars and I have bars left over. Weight loss was zero.  I lost on Nutrisystem before, but that was when they had artificial sweeteners. For those who want to know, this is low fat, low calorie, high carb, high sugar.  I do like most of the dinners.
Last minute gift for a 15 year old hockey fan. Arrived on time & he appeared happy. Can't comment on the game as we did not play.
While it's not a new neck, it does help keep the existing one freer from strain and tension. It fits right at the bend of the neck and if you lay on it regularly it helps ease shoulder tension. I put it on the floor and just relax into it and it works the best. If I'm trying to watch TV or something it doesn't have the same effect but just relaxing (or listening to an audiobook, music, podcast) it's very effective.
Bought as part of a gift for a soap making kit and it was well received. A little bit makes a lot of soap so this was a great value!Update: Still 5 stars! Made soap regularly for 6 months with these before finally having to order more! Fantastic lather and has made great soaps.
Exactly what I expected! Thanks!
Nice Strong pump(I have two one purched from here and one from another online vendor). Moves more coolant than I had anticipated. Right now I have the pump maxed but I will be taking it down to a lower setting. I don't need the flow that it is set on now. I have two of the pumps tied in a series using the Koolance RP-452X2 Dual 5.25&#34; Reservoir. had a AIO pump die on me in the past, So this series setup should allow for redundancy.
Unfortunately, it did not remove the odor as I had hoped.
I use only 14 to 12 tsp. If I have leg cramps, this works the best! My dad had hand cramps and within 15 mins of giving him 12 tsp, the cramps were gone. I love that I can vary the dose.  Check out Dr. Carolyn Dean.
loved the variety
Please use vinegar for weeds and not poison!  As a cancer surviver I would never use poison when vinegarworks!  I add dishsoap also and it works great.  Spray when weeds are small and you use much less product and nip it in the bud before weeds get out of hand.  I always use vinegar 30% straight with added dishsoap. Perfect, safe and simple!!
Best natural 0-calorie sweetener out there imho.  Absolutely no aftertaste, and tastes just like regular sugar.  It can be cooked with, but if the item is something like a jam, best to add at the end of cooking.  With baking, you're supposed to add 14 more- but I like it a bit less sweet, so just add the amount in the recipe.  Perfect for adding to dry cereal.
Looking forward to using these with our cloth diapers.  Durable and waterproof!**Revised review: we have been using these for awhile and they are wonderful. The drawstrings aren’t super helpful but we don’t need to use them that way. Amazing quality and great use! We are nearly a year in!
Perfect size. Leaves residue on hands after handling.
Product did not work! Do not waste your money!
Great case! You won't be disappointed!
The mats are very easy to use, they fit together and separate with ease.  The thickness is great, my pins do not poke through.  They also allow for very fast drying time. Overall, these are excellent.
I’ve used quite a few keto supplements and this one is NASTY. I could hardly even get it down. Didn’t bother drinking another one. It’s really bad. And didn’t get the energy the same as the PTK’s. Disappointed
I can't remember the last time a purchase made me THIS happy! Doesn't matter what season it is, my feet develop thick calluses and crack open and bleed (not just on the heels).  I have used all manner of graters (sponges, files, microplanes, etc.) and while they make my feet smoother, I can't get rid of the calluses.  The Emjoi did what all of those other methods could never accomplish.  My feet are indeed smooth and SOFT after using it just a couple of times.  And oddly enough, even though it took the calluses down more completely than the other methods, it seemed to be gentler on my skin than the other tools, which often left me with sore or bleeding feet.  I will sing Emjoi's praises from the rooftops, LOL.
Works really well.  One application was all I needed for a pair of older stinky sneakers.  Will definitely buy again.
After trying a ton of different metal nail files, these are the only nail files I buy!
I love this thing. I have a messed up foot from a call several months ago and this really helps when it gets tight or painful. The pressure is great-I vary it depending on needs. I use it approximately once a day and have had no problems. I use the heat occasionally and it is meh.
This is useless.  You have to place your entire mouth over the opening and then exhale.  I don't see how you could use this while driving or anythingelse
I hate how so many supplements use artificial sweeteners that make everything so sickeningly sweet. This protein powder is actually not as sweet as many that I've tried. Definitely more of a natural amount of sweetness that I really appreciate! Tastes just like a sweetened, creamy latte. I add this to my morning coffee and it's just perfect!This doesn't state whether it has caffeine in it or not, but I don't believe it does despite the cold brew flavor.The reason I took a star off was the packaging. I was super excited to receive a bagged protein powder because the super large (and usually half empty) containers of protein powders take up so much counter space. Unfortunately, it just doesn't seal back up very well. Did not feel air tight at all. I didn't want it to lose freshness so I just put it in a different container. Wish the sealing strip had worked better.:(
heavy duty, caps fit tight, could be larger.
This tiny pill is super easy to swallow and doesn’t contain ingredients that would exclude its use for people with celiac disease or dairy or soy sensitivities, though it didn’t mention anything about being vegetarian. They are also chewable.
DMSO is a carrier product, to be applied on clean skin away from cut sores and only to be used externally.Apply a little with sterile cotton, let dry and apply I.e. Icy hot or pain medicine, may give a licorice taste in mouth.This should only used for severe pain, check with your health care provider.
Best deal . Will buy again
Got  the clay model and I found it very difficult to warm in my small microwave . I’ve got a turntable and this wrap is large and difficult to pack inside. You end up having to fold it over and then it never heats evenly.  Once I did get it warm enough it was awkward to wear because the weight it at the bottom so it ends up pulling downward and  choking you.There is a rather flimsy strip of Velcro that is supposed to hold it together but it looked like an amateur job. I expected this to be much nicer based on reviews I had read.
This is giving me alot of relief on my back and legs don't fall asleep
I have referred this product to many clients.  All of Thiers have worked very well. Unfortunately mine has never worked.  The company has not responded to my calls to ask questions.
Slow results. Strong chemicals.
Been taking this stuff daily for a couple of months and have noticed a sizable difference in the reduction of lower legcalf cramps. From what I've found, this is the only supplement where you can get 1000mg of potassium in one scoop. Otherwise it is sold in 50mg pills, which would take forever to get to the minimum recommended 3,500mg a day (and you need MORE if you are nursing).I put this in with about 14 cup warmed water (30 sec in microwave) - it seems to dissolve better in warm water. And then I mix it in with 20 oz of flavored water. It does alter the flavor a bit, but you get used to it.
These have a great taste but after about 20-30 minutes I have the nasties belches. Can't say if they are working but I am still taking them.
I take this for sleep, regular bowel movements along with one Dulcolax every now and then since I have diabetes and my bowel has slowed down. I take two every night and it really helps the heart. Read up about magnesium! It helps a lot of things including muscle cramps.
Does it work? Probably notDid it have some placebo effect? Maybe a littleWould I buy it again? Definitely notThanks for coming to my TED talk
The only cleaning solution to use!
Love using these on my contacts. They always feel so refreshed in the morning
Works great.  Very easy to use
Nice product but the extended button causes it to pop open in my pocket a lot. Oh well
I bought this to catch the few stray hairs missed by several rounds of laser hair removal on my legs. The epilator requires multiple passes on some patches. I feel it pulling, but it doesn't get everything. I haven't used an epilator since the 1980s so I'm not sure if this is how they all are or if this one is weak. In any case, having the electric razor option is nice for the few I can't get. I have also tried the heel sander on my feet. Seems okay, but I didn't buy it for that.
I Love my little witch.she is perfect
THANK GOD they make a liquid version of astaxanthin!!! My husband can not swallow pills and this is the ONLY liquid astaxanthin I have found ANTWHERE! It's pricey, but it's the only one around so we continue to buy it! Astaxanthin is VERY GOOD for your health! It's a SUPER antioxidant! Wish they made a chewable gummy for kids!!!!! We take our astaxanthin daily as part of our everyday supplements! My husband has not complained of any taste aversion...I mix this in with his liquid fish oil and add it all to a small shot glass of juice...he drinks it every morning... (Poor guy! But what can you do when he can't swallow pills!?!?!) He doesn't complain, just drinks it down!!!
I love the portability of the individual days of this "pill case attache." It is great for 2x's per day doses. However, I have a few dislikes.LOVES- Each day is portable.- Each side is large enough to hold about10 pills (as long as they are not super large)- I find it easy to fill- The PU carrying case makes the pill compartments easy to carry. DISLIKES:- The pill cases are tightly enclosed in the case making it a bit difficult to remove each day.- There is no AM PM written on each cell; instead there is a moon and sun.- The days written on the side of the case are only one one side. Since the cells move around in the case, the day of the week is not always visible.In summary, even though this is large, I like that each circular day container can be taken in a purse for one day and there is no need to take the entire container. They also hold a sufficient amount of pills for me. Unfortunately my dislikes have me rating this case 3 stars. The current price of $10.99 is reasonable for this and a lot cheaper than the same case in black that is $5 more by another vendor.
Very happy with this!  I spent a lot of money 3 years ago for a teak bench which eventually rotted out and took up too much space in my tiny shower stall anyway.  This is lightweight and comfortable; I can shave my legs!  Probably best for younger folks not afraid of falls.  A frail person should seek something sturdier, but it is exactly what I needed.
I bought 2 in different colors.  One holds a nebulizer and all its parts in one place.  The other holds personal home medical equipment.  No more bulky boxes.  The different colors helps separate things.  And family members can easily find home medical supplies.
If you are looking for both a great maintenance wash while including nano ceramic protection, look no further. Excellent cleaning power and will leave your paint glossy and fresh.As the instructions say, do not let it dry on the surface and be quick to either washrinse off per instructions. This is definitely my go-to wash, and it’s quite concentrated so you can mix down as a detailer as well. Great product.
GREAT PRODUCT.I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT.IT WORKS.
Wonderful set for self or as a gift.Smell amazing and so relaxing to soak in hot tub with.Box it came in was wonderful and I have to say I will be ordering these again for gifts for sure.
Granddaughter really likes it
Absolutely didn’t help or feel comfortable at all.
I'm doing a 5x5 Stronglifts program, and my squat weight is getting pretty heavy for me. I weigh 185 and probably around 240 I started to feel a little pain in my knee at the bottom of my lift. Nothing super bad, but just a little instability? if that makes sense. Anyway, These things are AMAZING. They provide that little bit of compressions that just makes everything feel right. I'm up to 260 now, and squatting 4-5 times a week. Super nice product. Can't go wrong. I also used their sizing chart and it worked perfect. Went with the large for my 15'in pattela measured right around the center of my knee with my leg straight.
Shaves well.  The first one i ordered stopped working after 5 months of use. However the seller was kind enough to provide a replacement.
Works as expected.
This is exactly what I was looking for and what a great price!!!  These were much more expensive in the store.
Cheaply made
Perfect. I bought these on the recommendation of Kelly Starrett from his book Ready to Run.They are exactly what I wanted. Sturdy and well made.
Since we are at 6 million deaths as of today precaution prevails these are great for slipping inside of decent paper masks and probably regular ones I don't know but I put them inside of paper masks when I don't feel like messing around with heavier cloth ones for example at the hair stylist. My only complaint is that is actually a compliment, they have a little bit of stickiness to the edges so occasionally you'll peel them off your face but I've yet to break out or had any residue but I find an unobtrusive and living in a building with long hallways, fire doors, and non maskers it's better to be safe than sorry I can recommend
Great scent to the deodorant, but this brand was not a good match for my skin type resulting in regular breakouts in my underarms. I don’t normally have sensitive skin & never had issues with deodorant or antiperspirants in the past
These masks are, in my opinion, as effective as standard N95 masks and at least as comfortable to wear. They fold-up very nearly and tend to last me about a week each. The ear strings are comfortable and stretch easily. They're a bit sharp on the back of my ears, but not unbearably.
QGel is made in the USA but, unfortunately, it contains gelatin, which is not vegetarian or vegan. It is manufactured in a certified Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility and is laboratory tested and approved for guaranteed potency and purity.This supplement indicates that it contains both vitamin E as alpha tocopherol and CoQ10 AKA ubidecarenone AKA ubiquinone. CoQ10 is a biologically active compound similar in its chemical structure to vitamins K and E. Research has indicated that CoQ10 and vitamin E work synergistically as powerful antioxidants, exponentially multiplying the positive benefits of each. (See reference below.)This supplement also includes lecithin, which additionally helps improve the bioavailability of CoQ10. (See reference below.)CoQ10 is particularly well known for its function within cells in the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cascade, a crucial aspect of energy production within the body. Because cellular functions are dependent on an adequate supply of ATP, CoQ10 is crucial to the maintenance of health in virtually all tissues and organs in the human body. (See reference below.)CoQ10 is of particular benefit for cardiovascular health, especially for heart patients who have been prescribed statins, which have long been known to dangerously decrease levels of CoQ10 in the body. Symptoms of low levels of CoQ10 due to statins can include: muscle weakness and fatigue, high blood pressure, and mental fog. In the extreme, symptoms can include chest pain, heart failure, and seizures.CoQ10 has also been found helpful in the treatment of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, no doubt because of its raising of ATP levels in the body, as described above.Research has found that selenium makes an important contribution to the body's processing of CoQ10 in that it is required in order for the body to fully utilize CoQ10. (See reference below.) However, selenium is not included in this supplement. Therefore, it is a good idea for anyone hoping to maximize absorption of a CoQ10 supplement such as this one to add a selenium supplement to their nutraceutical regimen.Because it is fat-soluble, it is recommended to ingest CoQ10 with a meal that contains fat and to take it at a dose of 30-200 mg per day. The dosage of this supplement is 100 mg per each softgel. That is a pretty standard dosage for persons such as myself who take it to promote good health and not for a specific health condition.RELEVANT RESEARCHAlehagen U, et al.

This body wash smells wonderful. The foam makes it feel luxurious too.
All of the ingredients in this combination are well thought out and researched, and patented, potent forms of them are included. There is no magnesium stearate, etc. in the capsules. I find that this combination helps keep me focused and yet less stressed. Sometimes i take in the evening but it's equally good in the morning. The cost is relatively high for 2 capsuleday use but during a particularly stressful period it is worth it. I find taking 1day works for me, but my body weight is not much over 100#.
Have to have helps with COPD
LOVE this product and that it's offered on Amazon!
Honestly idk what I’m doing wrong. But once I put it in. It just stays in place with no effort on my part. No matter which one or two I use. So didn’t work for me.
God product
Pretty rock necklaces with a nice box, great deal. However did have to replace the chains with more sturdy tangle free chains.
This vitamin product works great, and I would purchase this item again
Nice size, noise level so-so, don't work worth a darn though. Waste of my $$.
Colloidals and nano particle minerals are great, wether you are an alchemist or not.. Be careful using them with any medical issues, especially copper, but if u utilize them correctly you can expect amazing results. Read up on them, & there are plenty of good knowledgeable people & actual Doctors and Scientist on youtube, that provide a plethora of great information and proven research on the different ones available, and the one or ones that are right for your personal situation.Blessings..
During allergy season my nose used to get so sore—now it doesn’t.
I have used and loved this product for years but it was a little green pill.  Didn't notice when I ordered but these new ones are capsules.  They don't seem to work as well for me and wonder if the ingredients have changed?
This is a "feels" review and as such you should seriously question the results. My name is Paul, I've been diagnosed with vitamin D so low it wins limbo contests. I have been on various vitamin Ds for years, every time I get my blood tested it's low. Every doctor's like "oh, well take 5000 a day you'll get it back up in no time." and for the past 15 years or so I've been taking more than that daily. I just burn right through it.I also get severe insomnia if I take it later in the day... that's generally how I know it's working. As I have absolutely no method of testing whether this worked other than the feels, I took it later in the day than I normally would my globule D3 dose and discontinue that. I had severe insomnia for the two nights I tried it later in the day. My assumption is that means it's either D3 or speed.On the feels spectrum it feels at least like what I take for 5000iu. I don't know that my body can tell the difference between 5000 and 10,000 however.The pills are interesting. Not particularly bothersome. No nasty burps post pill.I would say these feel effective, smell fine, take easy. As I've been on D3 for over a decade and on these for 10 days it looks like and it's now gloomy and fall-like out, I'd say they're working. I'll update if I feel they're not but it feel about right.Man, I hate making "feels" reviews... anyone has a D3 testing blood kit around let me know.Only thing of negative note was there was a sticker over the ingredients when I received this. Not sure if that was the MFG or Amazon's warehouse but considering it covered ingredients, manufacturer, etc I peeled it off. Attached pic with and without sticker.Under the sticker is that it's formulated in the USA, but nothing to indicate that the formula is actually grown, combined, packaged in the USA. The KaraMD, Inc address corresponds to a commercial office space in Cleveland but there are no clear markings from street view.I checked out KaraMD on the BBB as I like to know who's producing things I'm about to ingest, seems like a fairly low rating generally involving sales tax issues, some supplements that didn't work, couple of complaints but resolved. BBB will always have low marks as a note, nobody thinks "let's go there and rate this random company highly!" All but one show a response, which is a good thing. Appears you'll get a response if it doesn't work. They've been around and are responding in, at least publicly a positive fashion.I should note I'm pretty sure 10+ days ago the description claimed it was 5,000iu in the description text, 10,000 in the header, and 10,000 on the product I ended up receiving. What I'm reviewing says 10,000 for one pill.
exactly what I wanted!
It has an small buckle that sit in your ear when you sleep in your side.
These are great for overnight wear, but the thigh band rolls down during the night and can get uncomfortable.
Impossible to use. The area for the battery is blocked. Impossible to remove. Waste of money.
This is like protein isolates on steroids. Extra healthy. Extra Protein for muscle fuel.. Plus, joint support and soft tissueAll in a great taste mix.Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
This MCT oil comes in a fancy wine bottle and it is packaged like a fancy wine bottle. It has a slight taste of coconut oil, versus other MCT oils that have no detectable taste.You are paying a premium for the presentation of this oil, not for the quality of the oil. The bottle looks fancy and like a premium product, if that is the look you are going for. Maybe you are buying this for a bar or restaurant where the appearance matters. For the oil to be the highest quality, it would be better if this was 100% C8 oil. Other brands try to stand out by selling organic MCT oil.I drink MCT oil daily in coffee, and I have tried many of the brands. Another brand I have in my kitchen is the inexpensive Horbaach MCT oil that costs $0.15  fl oz. This Genesis MCT oil has the same ratio of oils and costs $1.48  fl oz. Premium 100% C8 MCT oil is cheaper than Genesis MCT oil.Many MCT oil bottles suffer from a pouring problem and drips. This bottle pours like a wine bottle, which is fine, and it has the problem with the last oil drip running down the side, like many other bottles. I keep my bottles on a paper towel.This MCT oil is sold in clear glass, versus nearly every other MCT bottle being sold. I am unaware of any issue with MCT oil degrading if exposed to light, but it is something to take note of. Many places caution to keep oils out of sunlight. The NOW brand sells their MCT oil in dark brown glass.The bottle says High Octane on it, which is silly marketing. They are likely trying to play off the pioneer in the field of MCT oils, Bulletproof Brain Octane C8 MCT Oil, which is higher quality and less expensive than this oil. Octane, the hydrocarbon, has a C8 molecule in it, which corresponds to the 100% C8 oil in the clever marketing of that competing product.
Fit perfectly in my ears and i got the best night sleep as i did not have to listening to my husbands loud snoring!!! Have not gotten to use the other ear plugs in the set yet but i am sure they are just as great :) thumbs up ear joy
You will need to buy a rubber insert or gaskit because it does not fit any scooter post no matter how much you tighten it, it’s too big. I had two different scooter brands and birthed fit it without the rubber gasket I bought at a hardware store. So your basket twirls and eventually starts to scoot down on your scooter. Otherwise I love it. I can’t carry my cell, purse, TV clicker anything!!
Very strong massage gadget. Does not replace a great hands on massage but it does what it says it can do: knead muscles.
Couldn't wait to apply this oil to my face and body.  My skin felt so smooth like it use to and the itching stopped to.  Added a dropper to my bath wash, it was heavenly showering.  Added a dropper to my shampoo and for once my scalp wasn't itchy.  Added a dropper to my body lotion.  Finally I feel like I can live in my own skin like I use to.  It didn't make the eczema go away but it soothed the itching.  This oil is a God send.
I don't have any kind of beard it is painful to use, when I tried to shave my neck, it was pulling my hair out rather than cutting.
THIS IS NOT A LIFESAVING TOURNIQUET. It should not be used in a real-life trauma situation. The materials and construction are woefully sub-par. Parts of it started to break immediately. It LOOKS like many well-known tourniquets, but it is NOT on-par with the real thing.That said, it's inexpensive and mimics the CAT-type ones close enough for training purposes. I used it at a class this past weekend and was pleased that I didn't need to put my real medical gear through adverse use conditions. A box of these would be fine for something like a Stop The Bleed course if budget is a concern.Again, THIS IS NOT A LIFESAVING TOURNIQUET. Training use only.
Will buy these again and again.
Though these gauze packs are non-sterile and a bit thin, they're still a decent deal at this price point for backup use (emergencies, disasters). I wouldn't use them in my main first aid kit for my home or car, but for my backup kits and emergency bugout bags I'm okay with taking the chance on non-sterile gauze.
I typically drive 10-15 hours a day for work. I bought this cushion to help with the pains I was experiencing as a result of my work. Not only did this cushion do nothing to ease my discomfort, but it actually increased my discomfort into pain.Before using this cushion, I took 5 minute stretch breaks every 3-4 hours and I worked 12-15 hours. After using the cushion, I had to take a stretch break every hour and I could only sit for 8-10 hours of work a day.Seriously, I am super disappointed in this cushion. If I could give negative stars, I would. I contacted the company to let them know that I was displeased with this product, but they wouldn't refund me. Now I'm stuck with this overpriced, lint-magnet gel square that's good for nothing.
I have been washing dishes a lot, since the dishwasher was not doing its job!!  But,  I believe I got the Medium size,  and they fit good, but not tight.  I have small hands,  and the Medium is not tight,  and not loose.  I can take them off easily and put them on easier.Washing dishes is tough for rubber gloves!  Knives and forks often make holes.  And,  these gloves are still going for me.  I like them.  They last long,  and no holes after many uses.  I have several pairs of these for the bathroom and kitchen!  Strong gloves,  last long!
the grapefruit scent is nothing like the description - just smells like cleaner.
The cutting head broke where the hinge joins the base.
I seem to have a problem with fatigue.  I am older and I can be sitting for an hour and start yawning to the point I nearly fall asleep.  I can get up and move around a little which does wake me up for a few minutes, but if I sit back down the yawning starts again.  I've taken these drops for three days now and have not had the yawningsleepy problems like before.  Not sure if I "use up" B vitamins more quickly or what, but a couple of squirts of this raspberry flavored liquid and I'm good for several hours!  It is a bit sweet, but considering I'm only taking a little and the flavor disappears fairly quickly, I'm okay with it.  If you suffer from fatigue, these drops may help you, too - they sure are working for me!
Following the directions it was easy to apply and seal up my new granite vanity top was easy !
I dont really know how to review a probiotic. However I will say I was on antibiotics for a bit, and it tore my digestional tract up, and these help get my body back on a &#34;normal schedule&#34;
AMAZING...love these. Thank you. :)
I can not describe the immense pain I am in after using this contraption, it seems to have all great reviews but I am here to tell you I can barely sit much less stand after using this.
By far the best supplement I have ever used. Vegan or not this provides so much energy, helps get your appetite down, and just makes you feel great...and tastes amazing too!
It was the business lol no but really it was very easy to use and comfortable.
I really like these wash cloths. Whenever my aide does not come to give me a shower, I use these and they are wonderful. They have a nice smell to them and they warm up nicely.
Skeptical buyer but went for it after watching You Tube videos on how incredibly clean this product transforms your mildewmoldydirty vinyl siding and decking to like new condition. We were amazed. Our UPS driver delivered an Amazon box to us and we showed him how clean this makes the vinyl siding. He couldn't believe it either. In fact, he took a snapshot of this product and repeatedly thanked us for showing him as he doesn't have the time to climb ladders to clean his house. We purchased this product's pump sprayer too; the sprayer reached the highest pitch (approx. 25') of our garage so we didn't need to climb a ladder to apply it either. Amazing product; will use every year for certain!
Good product
This product is okay.  The steam is nice, but I think I was hoping for more straightening power.  I must be used to the flat iron.  This is not it.  However, it does do what it says it will do.  Maybe my issue was user error...?
Hubby suffers with pain in the back and legs.  He has just started using this.  According to information we looked into, it takes weeks and perhaps months for significant relief, but he thinks there has already been some relief. The directions are easy to follow.  We are looking forward to the increased results with continued use.
Description says 4pairs, but only 4pcs =2pairs in package, feel cheated，returned. And found 4pairs with the similar price from other seller.
it is what is ya know i don't really care for it ...small can
I love what EvridWear has done here!  3 pouf balls, each with a different exfoliating level: white (light), blue (moderate), dark blue (heavy).  You get to try each pouf  all and choose your favorite. ! I love the white pouf, my husband likes the dark blue.  The variety isn't the only awesome detail.  These poufs are VERY well  made. They're incredibly  strong and durable, with  tight bonding that ensures the pouf won't quickly stretch out or fall apart.  Each does a great job washing exfoliating skin (all skin types!)  and produce a nice lather with soap or body wash.  I have terribly dry, sensitive skin and these poufs do not irritate or scratch my skin in any way.  All 3 are comfortable to use.  They even have small rope so the pouf can be hung up when not in use. The colors are nice as well.  I love the plastic zipper bag the poufs come in.  It serves as an excellent storage bag to hold the poufs until they're used. I was seriously shocked at the price. For as high quality and well made as these poufs are, I would have expected them to cost far more!  There's a pouf for everyone's preference. I just LOVE that EvridWear thought to do the 3 different levels. What a fantastic idea !  EvridWear even offers a 60 day quality guarantee. Your skin is going to look AND feel great  thanks to these poufs! Definitely recommended!
I like it but too long squeeze pump inflate.  I had injury my neck and spine. I feel like support sort of some my neck helps inflate.
Boring. No color to know what you’re having and flavor is weak. Wouldn’t recommend.
These are basically candy... With a small amount of elderberry and vitamin c. The dosage of elderberry is quite low and they are pretty much straight sugar. They also don't look anything like the picture and are coated in sugar. They definitely are delicious, but if you want something with a higher amount of elderberry and lower amount of sugar I'd probably get something else.
Smells so clean. Not a strong smell.  I'll buy more of this. I love it.
Mounted into Waterpik base perfectly. Only quibble is a slow drip where hose goes into handle for a short time after use. Reviews show it's a common complaint.
Great buy!!!! I would recommend seller ant time.Thanks.
Finally, something that does exactly what you'd hoped it would. 20 min use after 10 years neglect and all the calluses are gone. No more useless pedicures with some tiny girl using an emory board just that just smooths my 12&#34; thick calluses. This thing is easy, gentle and amazing!!!
I needed a new small travel jewlery keeper and this works well and fits the stuff I bring on vacation. I like the compartments and the quilted zipper case. Good purchase and the price was good too.
This is a great way to boost your immunity -add a little into your foods for both health benefits and flavor! I love the convenience. I usually prefer using fresh foods, but when something like red reishi mushrooms are hard to find in my area, this is the second-best way to go!
This oil has the classic sandalwood fragrance. Kind of woody, with a powder and incense base note.It seems to be one of those things that you really like it or you don't.It's a wonderful addition to homemade soaps, especially for gentlemen.
I will pass this on to my friends and family.
Worked well to keep my jewelry together while traveling.
Very pleased. Seems to me to be the real deal. Used it for years a long time ago. There was a little mix up on my order and they took care of it, so I would buy from this source again.
The best beard trimmer I have ever owned.  Long battery life! Easy to change and control trimmer depth.
The selfie stick is easy to use and easy to hold.  I love that it has the bluetooth remote.  So much easier than setting the timer for selfies. It extends to a good length and the tripod is a great bonus!  Love everything about it!
The good.I absolutely loved this thing until it came apart.It was easy to install and adjust to my 2004 Colorado taking only about 10 minutes. with a wrench, ratchet and socket sitting at the car door in my wheelchair. It could have been done with two pair of pliers though. Once adjusted it simply lifts out of place when someone else needs to drive the vehicle and is easily returned to position when I am ready to drive again.It was only a short learning curve until I was completely comfortable driving with it.It was the only left foot gas pedal accessory that I found that didn't have to be bolted to the floor.The bad.After only two months the glue that held the plastic base that has the spikes that hold it secure in place by engaging the vehicles carpet, completely let go as shown in the pics. I would return it but for two reasons, I don't want to be without it and I am afraid that the glue on the new one will give out in two more months.This is a potentially dangerous problem and you should be watching for it if you already have one or intend to buy one.Conclusion.I am not saying that you should not buy one but you should be aware of this fatal flaw and be aware that you may have to re-glue it. Furthermore, for $300, there should be some thought at the manufacturers level as to how to fix this serious problem.
Container : stiff, pretty, fits in car cup holder, no lid so after use you just have a tall cylinder with a hole on top.Tissue :rougher than kleenex, softer than hospitalhotel tissue. Works for wiping nose, but rough cold or touch up on makeup.... No. Also smaller than kleenex (comparison in picture). So softer prettier hospital tissue. Also because it's rough and stuffed so tight it's really difficult to pull only one out. I ended up pulling out a lot and tear all of them. Very frustrating.Overpriced. For the quality these shouldn't be more than ten in my opinion....
At first I loved it because I could breathe more easily but after a while it didn't feel that comfortable - kind of pressed against my nose, not painfully, but  I was just aware of some pressure.  Also when I took off the mask I had to find a place to put the shield, it  wouldn't stay inside the mask so there were now 2 things to keep track of.  I'm on the fence about this - it does keep the mask cleaner, no lipstick stains, and it does allow you to breathe but I felt I had to keep adjusting it to try and make it pleasanter to wear.  Tried it upside down and right side up but it always seemed to press against my nose .  It fit nicely inside most masks - both homemade and  disposable ones.  I will be so happy when we don't have to wear masks any more.  It's hard for me to hear at the best of times and the mask straps get caught on my hearing aids and sometimes pull them out of my ears .... but I digress.
It says its not waterproof, but I use this in the shower all the time and it still works great! I have seen my acne significantly decrease since using this brush. I love love love it! And the price is just the icing on the cake!!
Quitting smoking is probably one of the hardest habits to break. Any help you can get is great. This system kind of combines rewards and therapy. The sensor helps you track your levels so you get positive reinforcement when you smoke less. There's also access to an interactive community to share the journey with others. It's okay to get help when you need it. It doesn't make you weak, it makes you smart. Good luck!!!Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.
Does the job accordingly
It’s antifungal and helps itching  crawling
Bit big and bulky for smaller people but is sturdy and cushioned.
This is one of the nicer sets, having had one in the past that was chipped and cracked when brand new, and another that literally fell apart after the second use.The stones are nicely polished, and rollslide over skin easily. So relaxing, although if you are looking for this to remove wrinkles, prepare to be disappointed. Puffiness yes, wrinkles,no.Boxed nicely to make for a thoughtful gift.
Simply did nothing for me!!
The sponge heads come off almost right away. They are not glued to the plastic well at all.  You go through 5 heads when you normally would go through one.
Excellent Toner, though I didn't recognize that what I am buying is a toner when I add it to my cart; I thought it is a Facial Wash, I dont know I just did not concentrate well. But I'm still Satisfied. The toner is wonderful, it gave my skin that fresh glowing clean feeling and look, its perfect to wipe your clean face using it before makeup too I didn't breakout afterward. The seller sent me ( Collagen Wash Gel) as a sample and I was impressed with the result too, I'm gonna buy it for sure. Deserve the 5 stars. Thank you
Absolutely love these!Our whole family are Doctor Who fans, but I got these Dalek socks for my daughter for back to school.She was SO thrilled with them! In vibrant blue and orange, with one pair in a nice grey shade, they will work with a variety of outfits.They hit just over the heel, and the socks are soft and comfy. My daughter wore them and loved the fit and feel, as well as decoration on them!Any Doctor Who fan will love em!*Provided for my opinion and review
My husband says these are his most comfortable socks. They are thick like boot socks, and stretchy and non-binding. They don't leave dents in his calves and they stay up.
I bought to replace a broken chain. Very good for the price.
Found ourselves babysitting a mature cat which had to stay in our tiny bedbath combo.  No matter how frequently I scooped the litter it was bound to accumulate odors, (esp,..."Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you?" Remember Pheobe's song on the TV show Friends?) The litter box was against the wall right in front of where you sit on the toilet.  Yikes.  We keep this de-ordorizer plugged in.  It's all but silent, but you can hear it circulating the air.  I'm here to tell you, I always know when someone has forgotten to plug it back in when they've used the socket this occupies.  It makes a huge difference to our nose.  To us, that means that it's not only working on germs that hit the nose, but also those lurking around which we want nothing to do with!  Germs from potential moldmildew, any escaping septic gases, germs from morning sneezes and so on. If you have a semi-tighter area where you want to have the air cleaned and smell better, this is worth a try. It is assuring to know this technology is working for you.
This oil has a mild scent to it. It's what I think of as a classic baby smell. I think it's lovely.I don't really use baby oil for my skin(other than for insect repellant), since I don't care for the oiliness it leaves behind, but I like to have it around. It's handy! It's a main ingredient for many "doughssandsslimes", which my children(and myself) like to play with. The scent of it is relaxing. It's also great at removing sticky things, like gum and stickers, and for removing paint from brushes and hands.
This thing is amazing. I don't know what I was doing with my life before it came along! I use it for my shoulders and my neck mostly, but it also wraps around my waist and doubles as period-pain relief when needed!
cute bag. barely zips up and not that strong, so I will use only occasionally. good for the price. jars as described. fast delivery
yecch, do not like this one, seems pure enough but leaves a bitter, bitter taste for me.
I have used Heel Tastic for over 3 years and it keeps my heels and toes from cracking.  You have to make sure it is Heel Tastic that you order.  I ordered one that I thought was Heel Tastic and it was useless.
The parts fit together well but the squeegee is too flimsy and too narrow (if you put even a bit too much pressure, it is almost to the metal).  Squeegee doesn't work very well.  Not worth the hassle of returning but wouldn't buy again or recommend.Although you can take it apart to make it shorter, a full telescoping of all parts would be more convenient also
If you want to buy the best Carlons has been in the fish oil business ages before the fad began.
The easiest opener I have ever used.  It takes much less hand strength than others of its kind.
I sent them back
No product can work perfectly for everyone, but this has been great for me. I have always carried my tension in my neck and shoulders and then I hurt my neck about three years ago. Snce then, I've woken up with a crick in my neck that won't go away for a week or two about once every 4 to 6 weeks, sometimes more often. Sometimes it even happens if I just move the wrong way  throughout the day.I began to use this device about a week ago and it loosened my neck right up in about two days. I'm trying to get in the habit of using it almost every night for 10 to 15 minutes before I go to sleep, and my neck feels freer, more relaxed, and more mobile than it has felt in a few years.
These are inexpensive and a decent value for product. You get exactly what you pay for and what you expect.
Really good quality, arrived in perfect shape, loved each and every scent in this box! Highly recommend.
These taste great and make us feel wonderful!  You can feel a difference.
These clippers clip nail very quickly and efficiently with leaving any jagged edges.  I still have to smooth the edges down some but I do that with all my nail clippers, not just these.  These come in a nice tin to store them in.
After I figured out how to take out the center shaving head, it became a 5 star.
I have the month disposable contacts but I am meticulous about cleaning them.  I feel by using this at least once a week along with regular multipurpose solutions in my storage case I can at the very least double the time I wear my lens before disposal.  There is no material difference between regular lenses and those that are disposable, it's just the kind of care you give them.
These didn't help me find the pet urine. Maybe my color blindness is the problem.  The kids love them to play with. My UV lamp helped me much more.
They are life savers for my feet
My wife likes the color, fits and stays in place..
This is great but I suggest getting on and off a few times and take the average.. also check where it is in the beginning to make sure it is at 0. It is nice for a cheap scale.
It is alright.
I wish I had known about this product sooner...I already supplement with flaxseed oil for my rosacea, use Ecological Formula's TriSalts daily... and now this has nearly relieved my nervevein damage pain (from blood clots in legfoot) ...instantly. I can live better as a 20-something ... thank you so much Environmedica!
This fish oil has a very pleasant taste, so it's easy to take.
I can’t sleep without eye pads every night.These are hands  down my favorite and now the only ones I will wear. They are adjustable and so comfortable.
As expected. Tastes good.
Helped greatly. He refuses to get a hearing aid but this has enabled us to quit screaming all the time. I can also have the TV at an acceptable level before I go deaf.
Very heavy and thick thank you bags. They have crisp, clean folds and a reinforced bottom. I’m confused as to WHY the handles aren’t put in for you. The handles are almost like a grosgrain ribbon. They have plastic at the tip. You’ll need to push the tip thru both holes then cross your fingers that they hold up after something heavy is in bag. Though it seems like plastic tip is enough for them not to slip thru.
bristles are not sturdy enough to brush teeth and the bamboo feels like its going to give me a splinter... waste of money
These are the very best! Love the packaging too. BUT, way too overpriced on Amazon. These are Whole Foods' brand and cost a 3rd in store of what is priced here!
I am really enjoying the bottles i recd. will probably order more soon
I have been using this for years now if I switch it to something else my teeth becomes sensitive.
Cleans very well and doesn't leave a sticky residue. I ordered the rose scent and it's lovely - not too powdery or musky. The company also followed up with instructions on how to use the spray. Will definitely repurchase and recommend this product.
Great Around The House!!!
I will be buying these again!
I had high hopes but really unimpressed with this product. I feel i get a better effect with dollar store triple antiobiotic ointment.
My husband likes these they run wider and feel more comfortable
Not good at all,tasteless,like I am eating cardnoard. Will NEVER order this product EVER again!!
Broke at the seam completely while putting it on once. Also, the &#34;heavy duty&#34; velcro flaps to hold the o-ring cracked. all this within 2 months. Very disappointed, especially since I bought it at a store and paid way too much for it. Granted, I don't use these things lightly, but it makes it sound like they are for real, hard, heavy use... It is not.Stick with the simpler harnesses. Go with what works.
This will help restore your ph and will help get your gut and urinary probiotics and prebiotics in check. This will help keep your vaginal health balanced and help to  prevent bacterial vaginosis. This, in turn, will help reduce yeast by balancing vaginal pH and support overall intimate health by using this probiotic for 7-14 days. In women, the urinary tract is not really in a good place and we tend to get more infections than men. But this will help keep them at bay.
Received my first container on time. However, I’m still trying to pick my jaw off the floor after opening it only to find less than a container of powder.  I included some images along with a tape measure to show the depth of the plastic container.The contents is a very fine powder that looks thinner than Cacao powder if that helps understand the consistency.It has a sweet yet bitterly aroma to it.Since mine is missing the scoop, I used a teaspoon full into my evening coffee.The taste is not overwhelming in my coffee. As I’m using unpasteurized honey to sweeten my beverage.I have taken capsules of Lions Mane the past few months . However, due to a quicker delivery system the powder is supposed to have, I’m trying this.Maybe my container was  at the end of the line getting a fill up?I will update my review asa I can feel the effects of the powder verses capsules .
Does great job of cleaning floors,easy to use...
I love this kit. It comes with a wide variety of file textures. It works great on bare nails and on acrylics. I had never used glass files before, and they worked great - much better than I expected. They are also attractive, which is never a bad thing. (grin)  I recommend this kit. Very nicely put together and everything you need for trimming and filing a variety of nail types.
Love my bags now i can tie up my garbage.
These are great for keeping the mask straps from bending your ears.
I used it once, didn't seem to do much.
Love the size. It can be crammed to the gills with everything a home medical kit could need. Its great to have for traveling. In it I have pain and fever reducers, aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen  sodium, allergy relief, gloves, masks, scissors, band aids, wound patches, laxative pills, gauze rolls, cough and cold syrups, peroxide, antibiotics, antibiotic ointment, Anti-itch cream, boil ointment, petroleum jelly, rubbing alcohol, cotton balls, antibacterial hand soap, hand sanitizers. I think that covers everything. AND there is still a little more room for more soft type products. SO, even though when you get it, it might look small, once you fill it up, it makes a SUPER portable and travel ready kit. The price is right and it is made very nice! Recommended!
Kinesio tape is great for many physical body scenarios.  I have tried other brands which are not as effective as the Kinesio Tex Gold brand. It is very adhesive and generally lasts at least three days. You can shower with it on, swim, sweat, etc. It is also easy to take off and little adhesive is left on your skin. **I learned how to apply the tape for my injury from my physical therapist, I recommend talking to them before applying on yourself.
The band is fantastic! The material is a sort of malleable leather--I'm not sure if its real or not but it is strong like real leather.The purchase yields three difference colors:- Brown,- Black,- Light Brown,all of which come in a small package, wrapped around a piece of sturdy cardboard.All around, super product!Disclaimer: Free for review.
They nice for soap makimg, but when cuttin with a serrated knife, it really isnt easy. I found it difficult in cutting the loofah sponge.
My favorite toothpaste.
Worked perfect, my stem had a broken screw and this part repair d it like new.
Bought to put in a large (36&#34; across) tub; works like a charm.
I didn't like this at all.  There was no flavor and only bitter residual at the bottom of the shaker.  Yuck !  Cost too much for something like that.So I sent it back.
My grandkids enjoyed this probiotic. I tried one and it’s has a very sweet fruit punch flavor that seems similar in texture and sweetness to a pixie stick.
This did a good job with my hair. It worked as it was supposed to. It seemed like it was good quality. My hair came out looking nice after I used it. It also seemed durable. It was easy to hold and handle. I was pleased and would recommend it.
This is very moisturizing and protective with hardly any scent - which is perfect for me. Will buy again as needed.
When I first got this, I expected it to be brown like other products from these sources.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a large plastic bottle.  There is a seal on top that needs to be removed.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?Instead of brown like other products made from these sources, this is clear.  There is no flavor or scent.  Shaking it up does not seem to change that.FLAVOR?No flavor.HOW TO TAKEI take a teaspoon of this once a day in the morning in a small cup of water.DOES IT DO ANYTHING?I seem to see a bit of support in energy, sleep, and overall.  I am taking this in the dead of winter where it has been near zero for almost a month straight.  I am usually dragging and very tired and worn during this period.  I have been taking this along with a few supplements and I am doing remarkably well.THE BOTTOM LINEThis supplement seems to be supportive through a very difficult cold and dry winter.  I am usually tired, but taking this, I am not.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  This seems to be working for me.  I am not sure why there is no flavor or color, but it is helping somewhat so I will finish the bottle.
I bought this directly from the manufacturer. I must say, for the price, it was not at all worth it. Yes, it is a cushion, but it is a $60 cushion? &#34;Best in the world&#34; ? No. My cushion moves around on my chair all day long, and I usually find myself doing the &#34;one cheek lean&#34;. My computer chair is already cushioned so I went with this cheaper, thinner version (if I had paid $100+ for this, boy would I be disappointed). By the end of the day, there really is no difference, I feel like I've turned or re positioned as many times as I normally would. At first I felt like I would need to get used to the new cushion but after 3-4 weeks or so, it is still uncomfortable. The company reached out to me for my review, I gave the same review I did here, but have not heard back. Return policy is... Meh... Funny because I live in Utah and they are manufactured here in Utah.
good, saw results in about a week
They can be used vertically or horizontally. Great for Christmas cards.
Cap leaks.Hate the taste. I hope it us as good as u say.
Couldnt take this not sure why but did not agree wme
Plates and napkins are nice, thick, and high quality. Kids liked them too. We had a small party for our kiddo and they were the perfect number for the kids attending in a package of 8 of each item. Received quickly and in perfect condition.
I used this straightner for my 5 year old hair. She has been suffering from lice for about a month now. I heard heat killed them, however she has beautiful wavy hair and I did not want to damage it. This product is both gentle and effective. The brush combined with the heat gives a smooth look. I used this combined with a lice comb and I got rid of alot of them. I would not recommend to replace your hair straighter. I would use it AFTER straightening to create a soft look
Perfect fragrance for my kitchen.  Quality product that lasts and does not clog my diffuser.
With the fastening at the front, this wrap is uncomfortable. It's difficult to line up the velcro so perfectly that you don't get scratched.But with the wrap at the back, it's fine. Works very well for what I wanted. It's soft and seems to be a nice quality.
This doesn’t foam up and works well for cleaning carpets.  I like that there are no harsh chemicals, but more so…I’m glad it cleans.  It did a great job on my carpets and I will begin trying it on more things as well!
Tire broke while installing. Requested replacement or refund and was told I could only get $11 and would have to return and pay for shipping and handling. Damaged goods, poor customer service and still can’t use my wheelchair with no tires.
Been using for almost two weeks now and so far I love it. Love that they’re individually wrapped. Will continue to keep using!
I have taken 2 pills in one day and felt no energy or boost. I will continue to take since I purchased them, however I hope when it is in my system it will do more than this first day.
Good protection
Lid can half broken, then completely disconnected within a week.  Didn't talk to seller.  Thought it would be better quality.
Good product works
My joints are slightly better with this supplement.
I did not try these yet but so far I am impressed with the product.I actually bought them for my mother in law for Christmas. She likes her air fresheners so I thought she would like this as a gift. Plus they will probably save her money and reduce waste.They are prettier than the plastic ones, bigger than expected, and they also seem durable, and heavy!I will update after she uses them. But I really think she will like these!
Great pre and post workout mix. Yes, it has aspartane but then again, the last thing I want in my diet is more sugar. I thought the taste was a little sweet, so I did dilute this more than the recommended mixture (you will probably need to do the same depending on your taste). High in electrolytes and protein, this is great for my Florida workouts with the heat and humidity (and I lose more water sweating than in probably any other area of the country). I was previously a Gatorade drinker, but I honestly prefer this Science in Sport and will be buying more.
These work great!  I'm allergic to many of the dryer sheets and these don't cause me any problems.
Very nice and comfortable mask
"easy to use", "easy to remove" and "adhesion"  Removal of pet hair
These are ok. Didn't provide a ton of warmth but are comfortable.
As a husband who recently picked up the Heated Sleep Eye Mask by CareFor for my wife, I am happy to say that she absolutely loves it! This eye mask has been a game-changer for her nighttime routine, as it quickly heats up and stays warm for a long time, providing her with the perfect amount of relaxation and comfort.One of the things that stands out about this eye mask is its 3D ergonomic design. It perfectly contours to her face, blocking out all light and allowing her to completely relax. The graphene material used in the mask is top-quality, ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed and that she remains comfortable throughout the night.The magnet suction wire is also a great feature, as it keeps the mask securely in place without any discomfort or slipping. My wife also loves how breathable and soft the mask is, which helps prevent any irritation or sweating around the eyes.Overall, the Heated Sleep Eye Mask by CareFor is a must-have for anyone who struggles with migraines, dry eyes, or just wants a more relaxing and comfortable sleep. It's also perfect for nap time or travel, making it a versatile and useful addition to any routine. Highly recommended!
I've never used anything like this before, so my dissatisfaction may simply be user error. I'll try it again and update if I get it to work well, but they say to only use it twice a week for no more than 5 minutes, so it may take weeks to figure out what works. I got this when I had a blackhead that's not on my face only to learn that this is only supposed to be used on the face on skin that is not thin. So I decided to try it on my nose and around my mouth, where it tends to get greasy and clogged. Though my skin was left red with increased circulation, I didn't see any pus in the chamber.There are five suction heads to choose from, and the directions detail why you would choose one over the other. They also describe how to use the different heads most effectively. The heads are easy to snap on and pull off. They included several sponges that you put between the section head and the vacuum to catch any pus, and these sponges are washable and reusable. To clean after use, you remove the head and the sponge and clean them.I got a washcloth steaming with hot water and held it over my chin to nose like they suggested to help enlarged pores. I then dried off the area (as they don't want any water suctioned into the machine) and immediately started using the machine on the preset vacuum level. I thought it was level 3, but it turns out it was only level 2 out of 5. Still, this seem pretty strong to me. You run the vacuum head over the area, lift, and repeat for 1 to 2 minutes. The head also has tiny LED red and blue lights that shine at your face while you're doing this.You long-press the power button to turn the power on and off, but short-press it to change between blackhead vacuum mode, cold compress mode, and hot compress mode. There is also a button to change the vacuum speed. The cold compress reaches its coolest temperature (20°C68°F) very quickly, and you're supposed to use this on an area that has just been vacuumed to help close the pores. I feels pleasantly cool. The hot compress is supposed to reach a temperature between 38°C and 42°C (or 100.4°F to 107.6°F). It got up to 31°C then started dropping, then it turned off automatically. This was not warm enough to do anything but feel pleasantly warm. I don't see how it could help open pores when hot steam didn't noticeably work.
The best part of this sound machine is that an Alexa-type voice speaks to you as you set the timer: "15 minutes." Press button. "30 Minutes." "60 minutes" etc. It has a soft foreign accent that I can't place but it's cute. Most sound machines don't have a human voice saying anything. I guess it's needed because there are no light buttons to tell you which setting you're choosing.Except for this, I felt this device feels cheaply made. The casing feels cheap (hard, brittle plastic) and the buttons on the interface are not sensitive to touch. You have to press really hard sometimes to get it to change settings. The volume control is also confusing - there are actually two volume controls - one to raise the volume, one to lower. I was pressing one volume control (the loud one) thinking that I could lower it but I was mistaken - you have to press the "low volume" button.On the positive side, the night light works well - the colors are neon bright and you can keep a steady color going all night long OR cycle through the different colors. The timer like I said has a human voice, which is kind of cool. The weak parts are the button responsiveness and some of the sounds. The lullaby function is good and the sound is sharp and clear. The Nature sounds are relatively good - the best are the chirping bird sounds and thunderstorm but the "water" sounds (i.e., ocean, babbling brook) sound muffled and are not particularly sharp. The "white noise" is also kind of indistinct and the "fetal heartbeat" sound is just plain crude - not so much a heartbeat but like someone else noted, it's like banging drums.So...it's a serviceable device but I would not pay too much for this. There are so many better ones out there.
I ordered this shaver for my husband to try, and we’ve had nothing but problems with it. It wasn’t charged at all upon receiving it, it was completely dead.  We put it on the charger for several hours as the manual recommended and it worked.While charging there is a red light next to where the cable plugs in, and the light stays lit all the time  even after the shaver is charged. So you never knew if the battery if fully charged and whether or not it will overheat.The shaver manual is not much help and in fact makes this product more confusing. The printed manual and writing on the shaver box have conflicting charging instructions. The manual says to charge up to 8 hours and advises no longer.  The box says 1 hour for 60 minutes of shaving. This is kind of confusing because my husband was never able to get 60 minutes of use after charging.  He was only able to get 2 shaves each at about 7 minutes before the battery went dead and had to be recharged.So…. my husband will not be using this shaver since the battery keeps going dead. And the rotary blades are weakening from pressing the shaver against his face.  This shaver is a no-go.
As a true nerd, I really enjoy the packaging that looks like a beaker. It gives you the instant impression that what's inside is very effective. The toner addresses several issues with one easy treatment. It calms irritation, balances oil production, smoothes texture and brightens skin tone. It kind of straddles the line between toner and essence because it also moisturizes. It's ideal for oily and acne-prone skin. Use twice daily for maximum effects. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
The small roller handle came apart withing 2 seconds and wouldn't stay put.  The larger roller handle is very thin and will bend when using it.  I was gentle with the rollers, but these are no good.  Returning.
POOR CONSTRUCTION!  I HAVE 3 OTHER GRABBERS (DIFFERENT MAKES) AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I SHALL CALL CRAP.NOT STURDY.  tHE  FOLD IN CENTER OF LENGTH,  DOES NOT HOLD WELL;  LETS IT WEAVE & WOBBLE.  :-(tOO MUCH TROUBLE TO RETURN.GRABBERS ARE REQUIRED IN MY LIFE SINCE SPINAL  FUSION FROM T4 (NECK)  TO PELVIS.
Item was opened and looks to have had something stuck in there. Will not use. Waste of money.
I think this is a very good D3K2 supplement. It seems to be very reasonably priced (as of this review a bottle of 60 veggie caps costs $16.19 giving you a 3 month supply). One capsule delivers 125 mcg of D3 and 100 mcg  of vitamin K2. 210 mg calcium is also included which is only 16% DV. I take at least 5000 IU of D3 each day and usually more since it is such a powerful anti-viral and is so good for brain health. And in combination with K2, needed calcium is stored in bones and being 63, I don't want to get soft or brittle bones as I age. I think this is a very good supplement.
You know, I didn't expect miracles, but this is way better than the big orange things I used to get at Walgreens.  I wore them to see Flaming Lips at Bill Graham in SF on Halloween.  At first I though they didn't do much, but my ears were not ringing after the show, so they must have done something.  My major complaint? They're hard to hold onto, which means they're easy to drop and lose forever in a crowded show.  The canister is nice.
No good sharpness
Been using A Berger Lamp since 1989 and love them.. beautiful scents. beautiful containers (Lampes)..
Bought this for my grandpa for Father's Day and he won't stop talking about how much he loves it!  We tested it out before delivering it to him, just so we were familiar with how it works in case he calls us with questions later.We were surprised that it came full charged. We thought it was pretty cool that the LED on the front actually displays how much power is left; in our case is clearly said "100%."The bag it comes in is convenient and nice, but I doubt he'll need it much. Since my grandpa's dexterity is limited, we appreciated how easy it is to plug in to charge!  We also appreciate that it comes with another set of blades.I'll be happy to update how well it holds up after my grandpa abuses this one over next three months.
Study, perfect for any first aid kit
I think I can see a difference but maybe I don't see a great difference. I am only using it now because I paid for it and don't want wasted money.  Guess my morning routine is busy enough
The numbers were not complete. Very hard to read display. I sent it back.
Great for sever's disease . My son said are very comfortable and are helping a lot with the pain.
These sheets surpass any sheets we've ever bought in the ten years we've been married. My husband is extremely picky and vocal about each set of sheets we've tried from walmart, target, and lots of brands from TJ Maxx. They are very soft! The wrinkle resistant factor is nice too! They fit our pillow top mattress with a little extra room.
Perfect for putting Brother Tze tapes in.
These masks are comfortable to wear. The material is soft and slightly stretchy. These do not have filter pockets, nose bridge wires, or adjustable ear straps. I like the polka dot prints!
Oddly, Stevia is NOT LISTED as one of the ingredients! The ingredients listed are Maltodextrin and Silica -- that's it! The product is sweet however, and performs as I expected. Other ON products I have used contained the full list of ingredients...this must be a labeling error.
This is exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to use right out of the box, comfortable to hold.
Best product for stage II pressure ulcers and moisture related skin breakdown (incontinence related dermatitis). Wouldnt use as a barrier on intact skin (A&D or zn based product better if skin intact). As a wound certified nurse, this is one of my favorite treatments.......because it works. This particular product is the medline version of lantiseptic
The extended length of this shoe horn alleviated back pain my Mother was experiencing  using a shorter handled shoe horn.  Great length for anyone with back issues or inability to be as flexible as they used to be.
This is a super compact little light that I about blinded myself with when I was learning to use the controls lol. I absolutely LOVE the size of this, it can fit on even the smallest, most cluttered of desks, as it is just a flat screen with a removablerepositionable kickstand. Nice long cord, easy to understand and control. The light temperatures were one of the selling points for me as I despise white light, and this does not disappoint. It's warm light is perfect, and has different brightness levels. The timer is also quite nice. I will be ordering at least 1 more for my adult son. Well worth the price, having this in front of me, I'd pay much more.
I have an old paint gun and these are getting hard to find.
READ REVIEWS ON THIS FOR 1 WEEK ON YOUTUBE AND WHEN I TELL U....MY STOOLS ARE GREAT. NO ISSUES. NO STOMACH ISSUES MAKES U FEEL GREAT. THIS PRODUCT IS ALSO GOOD FOR PPL WHO MIGHT HAVE HPV. JUST FYI. IT HELPS CLEARS IT.
Obviously you get what you pay for. Came in a timely manner but I put the batteries in the tool and switched it off. It did not go off it just kept spinning. I had to take the batteries out of it to stop it. I only used it once and it never worked for me again
Do the job
Fit my z2 travel cpap perfectly.  Admittedly I was using it in a more tropical climate, so I can't attest to how well it works in a drier area, but it seemed to help with dryness that I've experienced without it.
Wet charcoal goes everywhere, so beware! And, it takes a lot to get it out of your teeth and gums. Even after brushing with toothpaste I had to floss twice. Have only used once so no results yet, but so far I'm not impressed.
Helpful supplement that I will be adding to my daily regimen. As with all supplements, check with your doctor first. For me, with continued use I see improvements and will continue to take it. It arrived with a quality control seal, and inner protective seal.

Reliable over the years, long lasting, wash cloth of choice. 4 Stars.
Helps with inflammation
The denture bath is nice but it's too small.
Presently, the best on the market, but get the Pro Formula as it does the job, as I have tried them all.
Product is exactly as described.
These are a perfect fit for the Scotch-Brite dish scrubber and they work much better than the name brand refills!! The quality of the materials seems better, the green scrubbing sponge seems thicker and more durable, and they don’t appear to sit and leak soap everywhere like the Scotch-Brite heads do. I will buy again!
Fantastic sponge! Durable and great feel to it. The band help keeps your hand in place.
It's really small and hard to apply. I have calluses from crossfit plus my hands rip now and then. This is no different than rubbing coconut oil on your hands.
Great buy!
I liked that they're transparent so I can see just how much water is in them. They don't leak and retain heat pretty well. Would buy again but they seem well made and I don't expect to have to.
So I have these flats that are just a little too big, my heels always come out everytime I take a step. I put the black pads on first and my heel came out as soon as I took my first step but then didn't the rest of the time I walked. They still felt a little loose so I doubled up and this time I put the nude one on over the black Incase you'd see a gap and I tell you what, they fit perfectly now! I gave 4 stars because I feel If they were a little thicker they'd be perfect. It's a great deal and I'm so happy I came across these! I definitely recommend them.
This product works pretty good for upper shoulder muscle issues, and it has a nice menthol smell that reminds me of Vicks.  This is a cream that absorbs well into the skin, but I do have to use quite a bit so do not expect it to last very long.  Having said this, it is priced more reasonably than some of the other pain creams out there and in addition to the topical analgesic also has ingredients such as aloe, arnica, boswelia, bromelain, and MSM.  All of these other ingredients have anti-inflammatory properties, so overall this product has a good combination of ingredients to combat muscle pain.
Cute, lightweight, fits well.
I bought these for a baby shower gift.  They are excellent quality and look exactly like the picture.
Wonderfully odoriferous. Good value, timely shipping!
I love this product, totally recommend to anyone. Will purchase again.
I've tried different electric toothbrushes over the years. It is particularly nice to have one that is so easily portable.  This works almost as well as my Sonicare brush, but the added convenience that comes with its size and being able to take it with me is much appreciated.The toothbrush pulses at 30 second intervals and shuts off in 2 minutes.  The toothbrush has 5 different modes and 3 strength options, so the brush adjusts to the strength and power that you need.
I am very happy with my purchase of these hot socks. My feet get cold very easily in the air conditioning &  I'm not a happy camper with cold feet at all. I have used these during the day while on the computer  & just love using them at night going to bed. You just pop them in microwave, slip them on those cold toes &  feet. Oh my what a warm fuzzy feeling. I can't wait till winter, my feet will be very happy this year after playing in the snow. I like to apply  lavender or roman chamomile essential oils to my feet also with castor oil ,cover your feet with a plastic bag & then put these socks on. It does double duty for warm,soft & smooth feet & a better nights sleep. I received this product at a discount or for free for giving a review.
Great product... good price... love the multipack... will definitely buy again in the future. Once you go Scrub Mommy you'll never go back! I also suggest that you purchase the Scrub MommyDaddy while round holder that you can mount in your kitchen sink (the one that is createddistributed by another company).
I suffer from consistently low levels of Vitamin B12 due to a pancreatic issue that I have.  I already get monthly shots, but my levels remain low, so I decided to get this liquid version for a quick pick me up outside of my daily vitamins.  I will admit that I noticed a bit of a pick me up from these, when added to my diet.  The raspberry flavor is pretty strong, but I always follow it with a drink of something else that has a strong flavor and it's fine.  I'm very happy with this supplement though and will be picking these up again when I run out!
Works great!
almost the same, well buy more
This toothpaste worked great, leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean, and not too dry (I tend to have dry mouth). As for the ingredients, they are vegan friendly, and the materials used in the container are ocean safe and recyclable. Bonus: made in the USA. Good toothpaste!
seems to work great. Have only had it a month now so I will see how it endures.....
THese taste HORRIBLE.  They have an oragano flavor that is just gross in a gummy.  They are cubed shaped as well so swallowing them whole is a chore.  I'm sure they work well enough, but I just could not get past the flavor.  Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but too gross for my tastes.
As Advertised
First... I purchased these directly from the manufacturer - thus it doesn't say &#34;verified&#34; purchase for me.  I went to the manufacturer because I wanted to try a smaller set (1 month set) which was not offered on Amazon when I purchased it.1.  A &#34;one month supply&#34; is really only a one WEEK supply - the &#34;effects&#34; are supposed to last one month.  Misleading to say the least.  Should say it's a ONE WEEK supply.2.  I took pictures that show NO difference to my eye.  NOTE:  I used exactly as described on instructions.  ALSO... my front, top 4 teeth are 15 year old porcelain overlays.  Supposedly this system is safe AND effective on dental work as well as natural teeth.  I didn't see it.3.  It is messy and a two step process... Tube # 1 is the a super stain treater and then tube #2 which you apply after using tube #1.  The pic I have included was after tube #2.  NOTE:  The tubes themselves were a serious pain... most of the time they were extremely difficult to get open even with &#34;careful bending&#34; per instruction.  I think I had ONE tube that actually opened without considerable force, which causes the swab to be displaced making it more difficult to apply the treatment.  They also include a tube that you are to use while you are out and about and have eaten or had something to drink that could be potentially staining.  It has a soft brush like tip.4. Initially the solution didn't really effect me one way or the other, however by the end of the 7 days my gums were very sensitive.  I have a sonic toothbrush with an all purpose name brand toothpaste and brushed my teeth prior to each treatment, which I chose to do in the mornings.5.  It is obviously a peroxide formula of some sort.  You can taste it.  With a bit of mint or something mixed in... but there is no hiding the peroxide flavor.6. In the end, photos don't lie.  I don't see any improvement at all.  Photo number 1 is before... Feb 17... Photo number 2 is Feb 23.  The rest were photos I would like to see if I were considering a purchase.  Hope it helps.In my opinion these are a waste of time AND money. I included the photos so you could make your own decision.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, but honestly, I will not be buying these again either from the manufacturer or from Amazon.
While I didn't get much from it, the wife loves this product.
This leather cleaner works very well both for shoes and for leather bags.  I tried it on a small spot before using it on the full bag. It was easy to apply as I can control the amount of cleaner. It just requires even application and careful rubbing and it moistens and revitalizes leather.
Magnesium is an essential supplement for women.  It makes a noticeable difference in my everyday life in many areas from lessening anxiety to keeping me regular.  I’m happy with this purchase because it’s a good deal for a quality product.  Thank you!
I'd have to say it's the first time I've reviewed a product works as advertised but still only gets 1 star. The manufacturer doesn't try to hide the fact that it will keep your bong cleaner, but not clean. Honesty is refreshing.However, I have a triple honeycomb disk ice bong and RezBlock seems to create a film of its own above the uppermost disk where it only receives liquid during a hit. When not being hit for a while, that section sits and dries, leaving a pink tinge to the resin buildup in that area. Being that it's an ice bong, I can't access that area from above to clean it separately. To be honest, it's pricey considering I still have to break out the RezCaps, pickling salt, and isopropyl every three days anyway.No one shows off a new, state of the art bong that's NEARLY clean.
I love Sweetsation Therapy products and this one is no exception! Usually, I order directly from their site, but this go it was cheaper on Amazon. Go figure? I purchased this after trying the Honest brand sunscreen, which I bought from Costco. That was &#34;honestly&#34; the worst sunscreen I have ever purchased. It was so greasy and oily and never absorbed in their skin. They were walking oil slicks for the day, and even with it slathered on, they still got sunburned. Not good!! Needless to say, I returned that product, and do not recommend it at all. Horrible! So, in my quest to find a new sunscreen, I decided to bite the price bullet and purchase this Sunscreen from Sweetsation Therapy. I am SOOO happy I did. It is a wonderful sunscreen, not greasy or oily at all. More like a cream that goes on and absorbs wonderfully. It also is great at protecting them from the sun, especially now that summer has arrived. No burns yet. Very happy with this purchase. I will be buying again. Oh, and it doesn't cause any allergy issues with either children, especially my daughter who has very sensitiveallergyhive prone skin issues. And, it smells like chocolate. How can you beat that! A little bit goes a long way, so the heftier price tag is worth the money, in my opinion.
Great little roller balls, and I love the color.
Sorry but NOT the best cleaner. Leaves mat with a film that I can’t get rid of without running a hose on my mat or putting it in the shower. Does not work as advertised. Seems to be a little t of false advertising these days on Amazon.
I love how they feel and help my persistent dry and splitting heels, however, I'm reacting with a rash to the silicone against my skin so I've turned the socks inside out to wear them and put my regular sock over the top so I can slip into my shoes easier and keep my feet warm in these winter months.
I like the taste of this one. I like the clove and mint taste. And it really cleans your teeth well.
This was an unexpected little surprise.  I will admit upfront, I *purchased this free to review* it.I do not end up purchasing everything I am offered, I do not believe in purchasing things, or taking things I will not use.  This, however, was intriguing to me.  I have long hair that is past my waist and I already use hair straighteners and curling wands.  I am 43 and with long hair, one must be careful to not fall into the category of having old lady hair that should not be long.  I love my hair and love good hair styling products and hair products in general.The brush registers in Celsius, but the instructions tell you what settings to use, so, getting past the learning curve, it is easy.  The thing can get HOT!  And I would not just set it on the counter.  The back of it gets very hot, even when it is cooling down.A CON is where the buttons are located.  When I am using it, I keep turning it, either, off, or hotter or cooler.  The buttons are in a very, very, bad spot.I have used this on slightly damp hair and dry hair and I say it works best on slightly damp hair.  Small sections also work the best.I have not had any problems with melting plastic or anything.  No weird smells.  No hair burning.Does it make my hair straighter?  Actually ... yes!  And softer too.  That was the pleasantly surprised part.  Do I like this better than my name brand hair straightener?  I don't know.  I think I like them both differently.  I think this straightener is faster.  I think my name brand straightener makes for smoother hair.  I guess I am also afraid of damaging my hair and since this is made out of country, I do not know much about the ceramics used and so I am very conservative and cautious when I use this.I have attached a picture of before and after use.  This was damp, just showered hair.Overall, a good purchase.  I plan on using it often.
No relief from pain this local medication
I love these pads. I purchased two packs, one for my beauty needs and one for my dog's! I have a Boxer and apply an anti-fungal ointment to clean his wrinkly face daily. These are perfect for both our needs. I wash them in a small garmentlingerie bag and air dry them. These make great gifts!
These are great q-tip swabs. My toddler really disliked getting his ears cleaned but these make it a much more tolerable experience. He's even wanting to do it himself now and I can let him knowing it's safe he can't push it in too far.
This is an absolute perfect gift to give my 19 year old grand daughter. She just loves everything that is bling and sparkly. This si a great size of 7 inches long and will fit perfectly in her purse. There will be no more waiting on her to do her hair because now she can do it in the car on the way since it has a car plug in. It is great that this is dual voltage as it will allow her to travel in the military. It is very light weight and comes with its own carrying bag. It heats up fast and works great on my trial run with it before I give it to her.
I was very surprised how amazing of a job this product does.  I have tried it on the dirtiest of pipes and some very hard to clean pieces and had great success with any attempt. Instructions were easy to follow and even a friend's pipe that hadn't been cleaned since he got many moons ago was able to come clean with the recommended time (didn't even have to sit for hours like recommended for dirty pipes). I've also found no residual flavor after a simple wash out. This product is very well worth the purchase and now I'm a lifelong customer.
I bought for work to check pull forces on material handling equipment.  Works just as well as the professional ones that cost $1000.  You can't calibrate it, but it gets close enough for what I need it for.  Excellent purchase!
Love this stuff
I got this for my daughter who's almost four years old. We can't find any bigger swim diapers anywhere for her and I'm so glad I found this! She's not potty trained due to disability and I'm glad there's something out there for someone like her so she's able to keep swimming practice since the pool doesn't allow those disposable ones anymore. I'd imagine that there would be many out there who could use these big swim diapers too. I like the basic colors. We can pretty much use this on her with any cute swimsuits over it. Can't even tell that this is underneath her swimsuit! Thank you pool pal!
Very nice and workable bottles for making oil blends. I love the cobalt blue also!
The tool itself is great but it's almost useless bc it won't stay on the floor. The suction cups come off easily. It's a shame bc it could be brilliant.
I had a good buying experience. Items are what they say. Only 3 ⭐️ because they unfortunately do not work for my hubs. Maybe it’s just him & not the products.  There’s a chance it may work for some & not others. For the price, it certainly doesn’t hurt to try.
The cloth liner didn't even make it through one house cleaning
These are so easy to open and close and stay closed too!  They are so cute and convenient for carrying pills in my purse.  I couldn't ask for a better product.  Price is great too!
This lotion is a must have in my house. I have insane foot and calve cramps that wake me up out of deep sleep. I rub some of this on and within a minute they calm down and I can fall back to sleep. Sometimes I just out it in my feet before bed because it relaxes me and helps me get a good night’s sleep. There is no smell. It’s not overly greasy or sticky. I love this stuff and have recommended it to multiple people who now also swear by it. It’s something I don’t mind spending money on because it’s a necessity.
This set of toothbrushes is terrific especially for those with sensitive gums and teeth. The brushes are soft and almost sponge like. They are effective at cleaning teeth without causing irritation. They are comfortable to hold and use. The cylindrical plastic cases make them ideal for travel. One of the caps is perforated to let moisture out. The four different colors help family members easily identify theirs. Very impressed.
Love the fit and style
One broke after about two weeks; I will see how the next one lasts.
Followed directions and takes some time so hoping it worked! Not easy to know if it works for money but will try. Not sure I would buy another unless I feel it does help to seal my granite from smelling!
I like the toothpaste no fluoride, it cleans and whitens however it has sodium benzoate
This product is great, especially for the price!!  It’s easy to use and my baby girl doesn’t mind it at all!
I cooked two of the eight burger patties I got off Amazon Magic Truck yesterday.  Little shrinkage and great taste.  Happy
Cute military-dressed dog matches. Gave away with candles during the holidays.  I like them. Price was too high though; I purchased on a whim.  None of those who received them as gifts mentioned how adorable they were; guess I'll have to choose my friends better in the future!
What an endearing book. It's as pleasant as drinking tea in the garden and kitchen with a good friend. This book is helpful, practical and fun. I would recommend it to anyone. Even though I have quite a few herb books, this was was a good addition. It has a clean feeling to it, simple and nice.
This toilet spray does do a good job of killing odors, and is quick and easy to use. The scent, however, is just OK. Granted, pretty much any scent is better than the scent this is meant to cover up, but the Sea Salt scent is more floral than I was expecting. It's an OK scent, but not 100% to my liking. The other issue I've had is that the sprayer doesn't always spray properly. Instead of a mist, it sort of splatters the liquid at times, making a bit of a mess unless your aim is perfectly true. It's only happening with one of the containers, so it seems that the sprayer is defective. Given the price point, better quality sprayers should have been used.The scent plus the sprayer issue lowers my score to 4 stars, but it's otherwise a decent product that does what it says it will do.
I buy these because I like that I could just dispose and they are not plastic or styrofoam but they are expensive
These keto electrolyte drops have helped me to get back on the track to losing weight. They don't taste the best in the world but they don't taste horrible either. They are better taken in something to drink. The bottle is good sized for the price you pay. The keto salt isn't strong tasting which to me is a good thing because I can't hardly stomach that taste. These work good and are a Great value.
WORKS AND YOU DO NOT GET SICK ON THIS.....ONLY IT IS a little too much money......but if you need it . go for it
I was so happy to see something pretty for an 80 year old birthday party.  These were reasonably priced, very soft and quick shipping.  Definitely use them again.
I have slouched my whole life and have always had bad posture. After having this product for only a week, I am standing up straighter and people are commenting that I look better and healthier—just from standing up straight. It comes with instructions that are easy to follow and I only keep it on for about 30 min to an hour a day while I do household chores. Such a game changer.
The fit works, very snug. Not as much force, it’s a slight notice of power as the “brand name” replacement heads but just as good for the price.
it works fine!
Tastes great. I used it in smoothies (frozen fruit, milk and ice) and it mixes really well. Not sure it would mix well if you are just trying to use a liquid- definitely better to blend it in a blender. I've had this container for months and still have half of it left, and it's just as fresh as ever. The price is a little high, but it does seem to last a while.
Couldn’t sit in at office chair all day without it. So comfortable, I could sit on it 247!
OH MY GOSH.... THIS IS SO COMFORTABLE!!!  My back is so happy...thank you!
almost makes tie shoes into slip-ons.
My husband is 60 and is dealing with new health concerns that he did not have when he was younger. Two of those concerns are decreased testosterone levels and a slightly enlarged prostate that has him getting up at least once a night to urinate. His doctor recommended that he take Saw Palmetto to help with his prostate and he wanted to increase his testosterone to find a natural product. Helix Prostate Support Complex helps him by combining Saw Palmetto for prostate health with vitamin b-6, zinc, copper, selenium, vitamin e, plant sterol complex, pygeum africanum, red raspberry, graviola, green tea, cats claw, broccoli, tomato powder, stinging nettle, stinging nettle, maitake mushroom, shitake mushroom and reishi mushroom to increase testosterone levels. Saw Palmetto is a natural product extracted from a plant that is native to the southeastern United States. It has been shown to shrink prostate tissue relieving the symptoms of a slightly enlarged prostate.Taking Helix Prostate Support Complex with Saw Palmetto has my husband sleeping through the night instead of getting up at night to urinate. This has allowed him to get a complete night’s sleep and he does not get tired during the day.I received this at a free cost in return for my honest review. My opinions are always 100% honest and reflect my own experience with this product.
Good for getting accurate circumference measures on yourself and others. The plastic portion on the end of the tape keeps the tape from retracting into the container and being lost forever. This portion of the tape needs to be reinforced as the tape is useless once it breaks.
This are HUGE. I tie a know on one corner and they don't fall out when the trash is taken. You can reuse them until they get really dirty and smelly.
I've used this for years now, it gives me the feeling that my back feels better, not sure how it works, but I use it on my back.
Excellent product for neck pain
High quality capsules !
These little bags are the perfect size for portion control. They work great!
For the past couple of years I've hardly been sick at all. I take my vitamin C daily and I think that helps. But recently I was around someone who was coughing and touching everything and spreading their cold everywhere. It was very frustrating to realize that I was probably going to get sick.Well I had one day of feeling like I was getting a cold and I took this four times a day as prescribed. Wow I'm not sick. This stuff really must work. I found the taste inconsequential. In a glass of water I could not taste it at all. One dropper full in water is the recommended dose. It is about 25 drops of liquid. I counted it to be sure.Buying this may seem expensive but how much is your health worth? To me it was well worth the cost and this bottle will last a long time as you use so little. When they say you will be well in a day they really mean it.I was very impressed with this remedy and will keep it on hand at all times. It works better than anything I've tried before. I even told my nurse practitioner about it and she thought it was good.Who wants to be sick for a week or more. I just don't have the time. As with all herbal remedies do consult with your doctor before taking.~The Rebecca Review
These are classic Ziploc gallon size bags with a nice slider closing. They are durable & hold a lot. A great find on Amazon for a loved one’s favorite NFL team! Fabulous price to pay for an unexpected special gift to receive in the mail! I definitely recommend!
Expensive, but excellent product.  If you can afford it, buy it.
I bought this hoping to increase my fiber intake to help regulate me.  It turns out it's only soluble fiber, which didn't do anything for my purposes.  The product itself is easy to take.  It dissolves fully (after a minute or two) and is completely taste and texture less.  It's easy to take, but it wasn't any use to me.
It really does pull the gunk out of your pores.
These are very convenient. The box looks nice enough that I can put them on a side table.
These do what they say they do. They are very easy to swallow. I have had no problems with them.
I personally do not like this product. It contains caffeine, I took two pills and I could not sleep for an entire night.The concentration of Vitamin B12 is too high. It doesn't make any sense to take all that Vitamin B12 every day. Your body will discard the rest with urine and you will have a peak of Vitamin B12 in the blood. Despite B12 does not induce cytotoxicity, why wasting money in something you don't need.Additionally, they put in Optimind L-GABA to compensate the effect of Caffeine. So why putting caffeine in the first place?This is an extremely expensive item.PLEASE be careful because they are very sneaky if you cancel the free trial subscription period on line on their website. In fact, you click cancer and you see a message You are almost done. However, you have to wait a few secondsminutes to display the final please cancer now. Only then you will receive an email confirming your cancellation. This is a very sneaky way to induce people to forget to wait and continue with cancellation and charge them with an additional charge.Alpha Brain is, for example, a superior product. More cost efficient and with no caffeine. If people want caffeine they can drink a coffee.
These aminos taste so damn good! I've bought these twice now and I don't know if I'm placeboing myself to death but I could swear that I'm recovering much faster since I started taking them. I've always had a few workouts that have left me sore and spent for the next 2 or so days and that has stopped. Just had to take almost 3 weeks off from the gym and I came back with no soreness inspite of an intense workout.The only issue I have is with the packaging. The bag is way too big and the scoop way too short for the amount you get. You have to stick your hand completely in the bag to get anything out. My knuckles always come out covered. A shorter bag or a small plastic container is really needed. Bag also reads about 40 servings. I got closer to 30 by using the included scoop.*EDIT* I asked Rem (one of the company owners) about the packaging and he said they're going to make the switch to smaller tub containers. So no more dusty knuckles. He responded almost immediately. A+++ customer service.
Love this stuff.. it has alot of health benifits.. and I don't have and issue with the taste of vinegar but my daughter also uses it  and she likes the taste too.. it took her about a week and now she even puts it in her water and like the taste.. the best part is it is natural!!!
great replacement for my favorite running shoes
These are pretty sturdy. Can be washed and reused easily.  They dry quickly. They are too thin to be washed in a washing machine. I plan on using about a sheet a week to clean my kitchen counters. These are way better than using a towel or sanitizing wipes. As these are biodegradable and better for the earth.I ordered these in two colors, magenta and fuchsia. They are basically the same color. And the color dosen't bleed off the fabric.
These cup are just odd. the gold rim looks cheap and it they break easily. I don't like them and I wouldn't use them anywhere.
I have a pair of duck boots and I have a few pairs of tennis shoes that have developed a smell that is somewhat gross!  I sprayed them with10-Seconds disinfectantdeodorizer and the smell has either been reduced to a minimum or removed.  I have applied this product at different intervals depending on how often I wear the pair of shoes.  It does a good job!
Perfect! Just as described!
I wanted a nice looking set of clippers but also needed them to be functional. I also wanted both a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper in one set. The clippers arrived quickly and when I got the set home I wanted to try them out right away. They came together in a set in a small cardboard box. There isn't a carrying case, but I will just slip them into a small makeup bag for storage.These clippers felt solid and balanced in my hand but were easy to cut with. The clippers are easy to grip because they are ergonomically correct, and they cut smoothly every time. They cut through the nail very cleanly with no jagged edges or pulling too. These clippers open wide enough to cut well, for I'm sure even thick nails,and are curved on the ends for an even cut. I had absolutely no problems in using these clippers. The clippers are made of strong stainless steel that allows me to sanitize them without worry of rust or corrosion. They should last a lifetime. I received the product for testing purposes. I have no complaints or problems and the product I've tried is working very well for me. This is my personal opinion and I am in no way required to write a review. I will leave honest feedback that I base on my own personal experience with the product I receive. I am in no way affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods.
Yeah, I know.  Strange thing to purchase and talk about.  Here's the scoop ... we are owner operators and so we own our own trucking company.  Every once in a blue moon, I go with hubs in his truck.  I also have a baby bladder.  I inevitable have to urinate when I should be sleeping at night.  Who wants to get out of the truck and go into a truck stop or otherwise in the middle of the night.  Don't want to have to wake hubs to take me.  Also ... the current health situation in our country ... who wants to use public restrooms?This one is cumbersome. It ends up leaking. Too much tubing. The gasket thingie falls off. I don’t loke this at all
Easy to make and great tasting
Not sure after using it only one time so far
It does not work for gymnastics activities.  &#34;It Stays&#34; seems to work better.
The texture is just right; not too much hard beeswax or too much soft olive oil.The price is reasonable compared with the big name brand.The taste of olive oil is ok & I'd rather have that than petro-chemicals on my lips.I'm not happy that the use-by date is only 2 months after the date my order came.So all the unused tubes will have to be stored in the refrigerator or freezer door until needed.
Not enough iron to keep up with anemia, even taking double during the one week a month.
These are pretty good for general noise cancelling - mowing the lawn, sporting events, etc, but I wouldn’t recommend them for shooting. None of them felt like they protected my hearing as well as my over the ear protectors do.
I used this only once since it arrived yesterday, but I was really pleased.  It is very lightweight, which surprised me, and when I was finished brushing my teeth, my teeth were actually so clean they were shiny!  It is much more comfortable for me than my former electronic toothbrush since it is smaller and reached all of my back teeth.  And just for fun, I loved that I bought the pink one...
A nice fiber pick-me-up, for no guilt snacks, andor light meal replacement. They taste healthy not real sweet but pleasant.
I don't mind taking these, they taste good and easy to get your fiber
Fast and accurate!
The order came on time undamaged and I am pleased I ordered this product.I never thought being to acidic would cause many health issues,now I can keep myself in check daily,or whenever I want.I plan to order from this company for giving this product as x-mas gifts to people in my circle.
Ok, so, I never know if the natural stuff works as I have no patience and end up taking Tylenol as well to suppress symptoms.Anyway, This past week I caught a pretty bad cold, sneezing, runny nose etc, I took this for 23 days + sudafed pe to suppress symptoms and in 2 days I felt human again, my colds usually last minimum a week to 10 days.I also took olive leaf for my throat and I think that took care of that.No natural remedy ever worked on me .... I think this is a winner so far .... Pricey, yes, but have been uing it already for months (I think it stopped a cold at the very beginning a few times) and still have some left.
didn't do anything for me
These are amazing. I use them to drive through the Canyons. And they are extremely helpful they also help you to stay calm and not get anxiety because you can't see the oncoming cars with their bright lights I recommend these to anybody especially truck drivers or anybody who has to work during the night
Perfect. Just what I needed to cut my husband's hair and mine
These cleaning sheets don't come with instructions re: how much water to use. I used half a sheet and a bucket and gradually added as I needed.  The sheet dissolved easily and the detergent worked well.  I like that it is so easy to store and such a space saver, thus eco-friendly.  I wasn't sure if it would work as well as regular cleanser but it was effective and did not give off the toxic fumesscent.
I've never used a water flosser before but wanted to try one. So glad I did. This flosser has a good size reservoir for one cleaning. Has all the attachments you need for various purposes. Works great and happy with this particular product. It's also easy to charge and can be transportable.
these wipes work great for cleaning lenses. They are easy to use and I like that you can simply throw them away. I would buy them again.
Their orange cream flavor tastes so much better.
Good Product... Thank you.
This is a bit stronger because it does have alcohol…which is what I prefer as it works best for me.
Product packaging was poor, with no protection for a thin box. Product itself seems to be undamaged. Quality of product is fine.
I forgot i had it. But, mut say. Fewer lasting odors now. Plugged in all the time.
I was very pleased on how much this belt helped with back pain and belly pressure, especially for the low cost.
never have seen such small pill boxes!
I was very pleased with these rinse-free bath cloths by Nurture. They are larger than I expected, thick and soft. With just a little bit of water and a couple squeezes, they produce a nice lather that for me, was enough to wipe my entire body. The lather isn’t so thick that you feel you need to rinse, and it dries comfortably without feeling sticky or stiff. These are handy for camping, for travel, for those who are ill or recovering from surgery, or for a gym bag. Very versatile, very easy to use.
This is a good idea in theory, but poorly executed.There's not much in the way of Pros, and many Cons.Pros:  - 1. Washable and reusable  - 1. As others have mentioned, this opens up the sides of the mask so so much that it effectively means that you're getting unfiltered air coming in.  - 2. These don't fit an adult face unless you have a small chin. To get the mask to cover the nose, the bottom edge of the mask will press into your skin above your chin and below your bottom lip. It's not a super sharp plastic edge, but it's enough to make a mark when you wear it for a while.  - 3. There's nothing to attach this to the mask, so when you remove the mask, this will fall off onto the floor or the ground unless you remember to catch it as it falls.  - 4. It doesn't work with regards to preventing your exhalation from fogging up your glasses -- it does reduce it a tiny bit, but not nearly enough to be useful.I really wish this worked as described, although it might work for children. Hard-pass on this particular mask insert. We'll see how some of the others work.
This is OK but not great.  It says not to use your finger but it doesn't have an applicator so I guess you're supposed to use a tissue?  It burned a little when I first put it on.  Later when I had to wipe it felt a bit numb, so I guess the numbing property does work.  I don't really like it as much as some of the name brand ones I have.
Great purchase
Not long enough.
Needs to be more evident what the scent is imo
So far so good. They are placed in the lawn and hopefully protecting from gophers.
TriNova Grill Cleaner Spray for BBQ  works great. Just spray and let it still a little while. Then you have to scrub at it a little bit. Makes it a lot easier then just trying to use water with the scrubbing tool!
We've already happily gone through two sets of these. Great simple teether. We tend to keep one in every baby bag to have on hand.
Very messy to use. Leaking.Please take it back
Doesn't dissolve.  I followed the directions from the online description.  Package did not come with instructions.  Could not see my using it to gift!
Hard to lose or misplace--they are hanging around your neck when not in use.  The masks are designed to adjust to your face.  No more ears flapping in the wind.  Wonderful idea.  I won't purchase an imported mask to protect me from a virus that was imported.  I ordered a black and a white mask on a Saturday and received them on Monday morning.
I like the idea of a finger brush to brush my dogs teeth but I think the bristles are too soft to clean anything.
The cider vinegar does seem to improve digestion. Not that I have a particular problem. The Cider Vinegar gets me through the day without noticing digestive nuance.They taste good at the end of my supplement taking session. I like them. Try them for a week, and you might notice a benefit.
You now, there’s no getting around it. A half hour’s worth of basic research on the internet will prove that EM fields have minimal, if any, effect on human’s health. However, if the conspiratorial side of you is dead set on protecting itself from the evils that are WiFi signals, Microwave emissions, etc, then this is the product for you.All judgement aside, I have to say that shortly after applying the product to the underbelly of my laptop, I began noticing extreme lagging on my PC. I’m talking snails here!Does the product work? Well it shot my PC to heck so I’m assuming, yes. And if that’s what you’re going for, than five star!As for me, I’m peeling it off now.I hate to be totally negative so here are a few positive aspects of the product.- Light-weight- Peals easily- Doesn’t smell of glue what-so-ever- Easy to cut and mold to your preferred shape- Actuallylikely does what it says it does (can be a neg or poss).Please see my YouTube Video Review for a demo and more.Disclaimer: Free for review.
Love this product.  Tastes great, no chemical after taste.  Been sick once in three years, feel great with lots of energy.
I love this brand! These came at the perfect time because everyone around me has a cold. These are a lot more gentler on my nose than the weird off brand my company orders.  These don't dry my nose out as bad at the others.I like that these are thick and don't fall apart and the boxes have an appealing design.
Very nice. Worth the money
The sponges are what you would expect to buy at a dollar store. The steel wool should hold up for many months - the sponges I expect will last a month.
I have eyelash extensions and this mask fits perfectly without damaging the extension. Will buy again in a heartbeat!
I bought one of these for each of my cars and have been very happy with it. It's the perfect size to hold a lot of stuff but not take up too much space in the trunk. I fit every kind of first aid item I might need into it and still have some room to spare. Bandages, glove, flashlight, little reflective trauma blankets, pain killers, and a ton of other stuff. Has a good system of pockets and dividers to organize things as well. I put different categories of things in ziplocks for the larger pockets and put some things by themselves in the side pockets.
I have been using these for dishwashing and they are little big for me,  but they are workable!  I have used the other pair for bathroom cleaning and same thing.  They hold well enough.  They have long sleeves and seem to be really good quality.  Great cleaning and dishwashing gloves!
Good fit.  Decent backing.  Not as plush as some, but nonetheless, a very good liner at a good price.
These are on point!
This has an awesome taste but what i didn't love was the fact  that although they said on their website it is third party certified, I didn't see the seal on the product itself.
My mum looks beautiful in blue!  Everyone is happy with the stand out color and solid construction.  Thank you for making this cherished urn to hold our mum.
This sound machine comes with a total of 28 sounds; 18 are under the white noise button and 12 are under the lullaby button. This is a plug-in unit and comes with a USB cable but no AC adapter, the unit itself, and a regular instruction pamphlet.Operation is simple as per my video. All the controls are on the top front of the unit. I have to "hold press" the ONOFF button to turn it ON and do the same to turn it OFF.There are seven operational buttons on the top. The timer can be set for 30, 60, or 90 minutes or turned off for continuous play. The unit can be used as a nightlight only or with the sound.Most of the sounds are crisp but a couple are a bit staticky and that is the reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.The current price of $23.39 ($25.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced.
worked great for a web
The two buttons are not enough. I needed 3 buttons on each flap side in order to secure it. For both my toddler and newborn.
It works as described, but I bought it without reading the ingredients and it contains Egg Yolk which I am allergic to it 😐
I waited 6 months to post my review because I wanted to use this iron long enough. I am a seamster . I use my iron every day. I have had many irons in my 75 years of life. Listen to me and DO NOT BUY THIS IRON. It does not steam but it POURS the water in one part of your fabric while other parts are dry. This iron has not been made for even, nice, steam. Something is wrong. I use only distilled water. Dont pay even 10 Dollars for this iron.
Easy way to get your fiber and no mixing!
Smells fresh and clean. MakesCleaning the shower easy.
Love these, they work just great. My only peeve is that they squeak, but I remedied that by coating the squeaky parts with graphite as a dry lubricant so that it didn't collect dust and hair. I have advanced peripheral neuropathy, a nerve condition, so walking is a pain. The cane I used just doesn't cut it anymore, I needed support on both sides, so I puchased these and can move around swiftly instead of slow.
I'm stocking up on all immune boosters from here on out! Elderberry gummies are at the top of my list and these gummies have echinacea as well to boost immunity. Love the gummies since they taste good and are super easy to chew for the kids as well. I am convinced after using them through cold and flu season that they really do help.
Purchased this so that my girlfriend and I could better track our weightprogress as we both work towards getting into better shape. The scale appears to be well constructed, works as intended, and looks great to boot!
Flavor not as bad, as described.
These are now something you may need if wearing a mask for  many hours a day, several days a week.  The silicone doesn't pull on your hair so its comfortable. It can be a bit small depending on the size of your head. My husband has a big head and it can be tight depending on the mask straps.  They worked fine for me and they have saved my ears from chafing.  The ear loops hook easily over the button thingy on the extender.  Th extender has a small amount  of stretch so you can adjust your mask for the comfort level you prefer.
Like magic, these things scrap away dirt like nothing else. I finally found a product that does not scratch but gets dirt off. My only problem is they really are one shot only, and deteriorate very quickly. They cannot take much abuse but they do what no other sponge can.
These brake after flossing one or 2 teeth. I had to throw them away.
Good suction. Not super long. With the thickness, not so much for beginners. Good buy, though.
These drink packets are perfect for rehydrating after a long bike ride. They are very compact and light, which is nice for being out and about. The drink has nice flavor and isn't overly fruity or sugary.
great product thanks
arrive as promised - was as described - nicely packaged -
This is an excellent blood pressure monitor. There are only a few minor quibbles that doesn't take away from how good the unit performs.Pluses- Very well made- Attractive shape and appearance- Large, easy to read display- Well written & informative user guide- Voice prompts provide start status and read out of results- 2 user memory function- Cuff has instructions that provide guidance on proper fit- Micro USB power option- Results were accurate (in line with results received during annual physical exam)Minuses- 3 AAA batteries not included- USB cable & charger are also not includedIn a lot of cases with devices that take batteries, you normally get really cheap no-name batteries. I don't mind that they're not included, as I'd rather spend the money on good quality alkalines or rechargeables. But I can see where not having batteries to get you started would be a bummer. Likewise, I'm not really disappointed that a charger isn't included, especially at this price point.Those little inconveniences aside, the unit works incredibly well. It's easy to know the direction when placing the cuff on. The user guide is well written; it was easy to follow the step by step instructions. Even though I could see the results on the large LCD screen, it was to have the voice prompts let me know my results. I see this as a great benefit to elderly people who may have a little trouble reading the screen. And you can save your results to memory, for 2 separate users, to recall at a later date. Nice.
I've been trying new dental products lately looking for something more natural that works. I won't be ordering this again though. It is not offensive in any way. I just don't care for it. It doesn't have much flavor or leave my breath fresh. It's crumbly and the bits can easily slip out of your mouth while brushing. I do use an electronic toothbrush though so maybe with manual it might work better. It's just not for me.
Slim and well made.  It fits perfectly at the end of my 12&#34; deep cupboard over the sink.  The installation was easy because of the numerous slots available for drilling and anchoring. The Georgia Pacific 21000 two ply style towels fit just right and pull out singularly without waste.  This is the second commercial-style towel dispenser that I have purchased for my kitchen in the last four years.  The first one was a slim roll design that dispensed single ply towels.  The double  ply towels dispensed with this unit are stronger and more absorbent requiring fewer towels for average cleanup in the kitchen.  This was actually a cost-saving investment.
I like to use these to add to my laundry for an extra boost of cleanliness. My bf gets sweaty and oily and that transfers to clothes and sheets. I mix the borax and washing soda together and sprinkle a scoop into every load to keep the soil at bay. They help my wash smell fresh and stay clean.
I was hesitant to get this based on some of the negative reviews here - but the positive ones convinced me to try it.  And, the price was good enough that I thought &#34;why not?&#34;First of all, I have fibromyalgia and have severe pains and have been desperate.  I'm not someone who is comfortable to get a massage, and even if I was I would be poor if I went as often as I would need to.  So, what to do?Ok.  I got it today and tried it about a half an hour ago.  I think that alone tells you what I think of this spa mat!  (that I literally came on here to review it right away)  :)I didn't even bother with &#34;low&#34; and went right to &#34;medium&#34; (high seemed to scare me for the initial setting - I figured it'd be similar to a tsunami).  The power of the bubbles was AMAZING!  Gets you ALL over and was so powerful that the tub looked like a pot of crazy hot boiling water.  And that was on MEDIUM!Oh, and yeah - while a 10-15 minute bath is usually cool at the end, this amazin' beauty keep the water at a nice temp.  :)Regarding the mat floating - it does.  Some of the suction cups stuck great and others did not.  Frankly, who cares??  This is supposed to make the water bubble and it does that job fantastically.  Made me feel good and relaxed :)  WOO!Lastly - other people complained about the noise.  The noise of the unit is quiet.  The MASSIVE BUBBLING is noisy!  ;)  And seriously, if you're complaining about bubbling noise then why did you get a &#34;body bubbles bath spa&#34; mat?  lol  Personally, I liked it and it reminded me of being on vacation and in a big hot tub.And, for storage, I figured that since I'll likely be using it 2-3 times a week the best way to store the mat is just to stick it on the side of the shower wall ;)  Perfect (so the excess water can drain out and it can dry well).
Very nice.  Looks just as pictured.  I put a yarn project keeper, some yarn and a couple other small items without trouble.  The measurements given were active.  The ribbon is lovely, thick satin ribbon and is white.  Plenty of it with lots of tail after closing the top.  The material of the bag is thin, but effective - I can't see through it.  I would buy again.  It's a lovely, reusable gift bag. It arrived quickly (I have prime) and in great shape along with other items I ordered.
A word of caution. I'm sensitive to stimulants. So the first 3 days this messed with my stomach a bit. After that Im good to go. At 178lbs the recommended dosage is 22 scoops for me. Because im sensitive to stimulants that is just too much. Everytime i do two scoops I end up bonking mid workout. Shaky hands, starving, have to stop and eat and rest a good half hour before finishing. I always eat an hour before my workout and only have this issue with two scoops. One scoop for me is perfect. Makes my face tingle, helps me kill my workout. I love this stuff. so my recommendation is to try it in different dosages until you find your sweet spot. Maybe you are a 12 scoop person, maybe you need the full two scoops. ust dont try it once and say it's not for you. Give it time, give it a chance. You'll love it.
I definitely need something else
Not only are these very helpful when you have a sick child with the flu etc.My husband had open heart surgery over a month ago, but when he came home from the hospital his electrolytesWhere still off.I mixed one of these with water, he drank it as his Dr. Told him too when he called him to say howAwful he was feeling. This mommy’s Bliss saved us a trip back to the hospital, but put my husband back on track to recovering.
I like it. Its smaller than most pill organizers, which I prefer since I only take a few pills. But honestly, it isnt worth more than $3-$4. Wait for the price to go down because even paying $5 for this, I thought I was overcharged. If you really love the aesthetic of the rainbow, go for it. But if you need more space for vitamins and pills, get something else.
Great for camping or your purse for any cleanups. I don't think it's worth the money though - they're not SO high quality that it's worth it. Individual packing and natural is why I liked them, but won't be repurchasing.
Only thing is, I have a pacemaker and you can’t use this product with a pacemaker. Therefore, it’s useless to me.  My husband LOVES it for his back and legs though.  So it turned out as a great present!  Lol
These drops stopped the stingingitching immediately upon first use. I’m pleased.
Very convenient and effective product
This provides a subtle, as in VERY subtle, difference.I can't say that it was enough to justify the price, but everyone is different in that area. In addition, everyone's body is different, and yours may respond better than mine.I definitely believe in the theory behind it. But I'm the sort of person that can't wear certain watches because they stop, or I touch light switches and get a little shock, even when there is no activity that would cause it such as walking on a carpet creating static electricity.So do give it a try, this is one of those items that can't hurt and might help. My hope is that it helps you more than it's helped me. Best of luck to you.
The flavor is great the price is ridiculous.
