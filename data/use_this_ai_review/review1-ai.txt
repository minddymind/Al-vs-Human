I purchased this hoping it would tackle litter box smells, but I honestly don’t notice a difference. Plus, it’s noisy, so I wouldn’t recommend it for this purpose.
This supplement has been a game-changer for my son’s ADHD. Adding just 10 drops to his morning orange juice, combined with other holistic treatments, helps him stay focused at school without the need for prescription medication. Recommended by his holistic doctor, it’s been a lifesaver.
Unfortunately, this didn’t fit my massage table, and despite the return policy stating it was returnable, I found out it wasn’t. Now I’m stuck with a pricey item I can’t use.
The product arrived crammed into a tiny box, which left the tubing bent and cracked. It wouldn’t hold air and had to be returned. Poor packaging ruined an otherwise promising product.
These tissues are fine—not super soft, but not rough either. The canister design works well, especially in cars without cupholders. Be careful opening it; I ripped mine but taped it back together, and now it’s great.
This product works exactly as described! The set of five is convenient, and the case is well-designed for storage.
I was hoping for more shoulder correction, but this provides only light back support and a slight pull for the shoulders. It’s more of a wrap than a full corrective brace.
It’s okay but lacks the power of my old Wahl clippers. It gets the job done but isn’t particularly impressive.
These bath bombs are large and strongly scented but lack variety in fragrance or appearance. The packaging isn’t gift-worthy, with a noticeable "Made in China" barcode. Kids might enjoy the fizz, but overall, these are underwhelming.
This keto supplement is fantastic! It works effectively to burn fat and is reasonably priced. Highly recommend!
I bought these based on a YouTube recommendation but was disappointed. The taste is terrible compared to their caramel collagen powder. I wouldn’t buy these again.
This product does exactly what it promises—simple and effective. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase!
Hands down, this works better than anything else I’ve tried. Absolutely satisfied!
Switching from Burt’s Bees drops to these was a mistake. The taste and texture are awful, and they’re overpriced. Not recommended.

Best toothpaste ever! The minty flavor is perfect, and it whitens beautifully. Delivery was quick, too.
It’s okay for light dusting but not great for thorough floor cleaning. Decent for small tasks.
JUNP is a fantastic electrolyte mix—less sweet but just as effective as Liquid IV. It has a great blend of electrolytes and comes in a compact canister that’s easy to store. Perfect for athletes and adults alike!
Each tablet is supposed to last 30 days, but mine only lasts two weeks. I double-checked by marking my calendar. This was disappointing and misleading.
These smell wonderful, but the scent isn’t strong enough to fill a space unless you use a lot of them. When noticeable, though, they’re amazing.
This product is incredible! I can’t imagine being without it now. It’s become an essential part of my routine.
These socks didn’t work for me in Wisconsin’s frigid winters. I prefer battery-operated warming socks for cold weather.

SelectSocial CBD products are excellent. I appreciate their third-party testing for accuracy, and the added herbal ingredients in the capsules are a nice bonus.
These work well for heel pain, but correct placement is critical. Misaligning them can cause issues, so take your time during application.
My air filter’s UV light burned out, and this was a great replacement. Plugged it in, and it’s working perfectly alongside my system.
This product is a great alternative to the Johnson & Johnson brand. It’s comparable in quality and performs just as well.

These socks are perfect for long flights, though they’re a bit thin. Wearing a second pair over them adds cushioning for extra comfort.
The run time is only 90 minutes, which isn’t long enough for my needs. I wish it lasted hours instead.
These pads work wonders for my endometriosis cramps. While they don’t eliminate the pain entirely, they significantly ease it. The cooling sensation is refreshing, and they smell great without causing irritation.
These carnitine tablets are effective for managing fibro pain and boosting energy. The long orange bottle makes them easy to spot, and the tablets are manageable to swallow with water. I’m very happy with them.
This bag is durable and excellent value for the price. I highly recommend it for anyone needing a reliable option.
The pumice stone is high-quality, and the handle makes it easy to use. It’s a great tool for anyone needing heel care.
This product works well, and I’m glad I purchased it. The adjustable jets are a nice touch, and the suction cups hold everything securely in place.
These molds are fantastic for making candies! I mostly use them for organic gummies, and they work beautifully. The shapes are adorable and versatile for other treats too.
This hairbrush is a game-changer for straightening! It works effortlessly on my thick, long hair and makes styling so much easier. Highly recommend!

Classic Comet performance! It works just as it should, leaving surfaces spotless. I’ll definitely keep using this.
This tissue is a good balance of softness and durability. The price varies a lot between vendors, so watch out for that, but it’s worth it at the right price.
I’ve been using Lion’s Mane powder for two months and love how easy it is to mix into drinks. It’s flavorless, highly beneficial, and supports overall health with numerous potential benefits.
I love this scale! It syncs seamlessly with my phone and Fitbit app. The only downside is having to weigh myself multiple times for an accurate reading, but it’s still a fantastic product.
This protein powder is perfect for meal-replacement shakes. It’s soy-free, dairy-free, and reasonably priced. I mix it with cocoa powder or peanut butter for added flavor.
This worked fine for three months, then stopped entirely. I tried contacting the seller but received no response. Very disappointing.
These are great quality and were a hit as gifts for my Face Fitness class attendees. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice they are!
Exactly what you’d expect. Works great for stirring and does its job well.
These are labeled as "one size fits most," but that’s definitely not the case. They barely fit my daughter, who wears a size 8, and kept sliding down due to the poor waistband. Warm, but not recommended for anyone above a size 8 or below a 6.
These gua sha stones are polished and smooth, with no chips or flaws. They feel amazing after being chilled in the fridge overnight. Highly recommended for their quality and presentation.
After just one night and two doses, I noticed significant relief from my asthma and excess mucus. It’s flavorless, has no side effects, and genuinely works. I’ll definitely be ordering more!
Surprisingly comfortable for such a low price. They come with slim cases and retainer cords. While not perfect, the quality is impressive for the cost.
This bath bomb basket makes a great gift. The bombs dissolve slowly and don’t leave residue. While the grapefruit scent didn’t match expectations, the peppermint was spot on. Overall, a good value.
This shaver is excellent! The 7-head configuration works beautifully, and battery life is phenomenal. Avoid using overly thick creams, as they can clog the heads. Great value, rivaling much pricier models.
A clever concept, but the execution doesn’t work for most face shapes. It caused discomfort on the bridge of my nose and didn’t stay in place. Not ideal unless you have a small nose.
This adjustable shoehorn is perfect for someone with limited mobility. It works well and is a lifesaver for me with my bad spine. Great product!
I couldn’t get past the strong smell and taste of this chlorella powder. While it may work for others, I found it unbearable and won’t be purchasing again.
This essential oil set is perfect for beginners! The pre-mixed blends are convenient, the quality is excellent, and the packaging is gift-worthy. Highly recommended for aromatherapy or gifting.
It’s still too early to tell if this product is effective, but so far, I’m optimistic.
These shower steamer bombs are colorful, aromatic, and dissolve cleanly. The scent is lovely but gets overpowered by nearby shampoos or soaps. Still, they provide an invigorating experience and come beautifully packaged.
My husband loves this trimmer! The price was a deciding factor, and it’s proven to be a great deal. Highly recommended.
The item arrived as described and on time. No complaints.
This trimmer works well in the shower, though it doesn’t provide as close a shave as a razor blade. Still, it’s a solid option.
Comfortable to wear but doesn’t do much to address sweating under the mask. Decent but not amazing.
Initially pleased, but this lens solution started burning my eyes. Even after rinsing with saline, it was uncomfortable. I’ve switched back to BioTrue.
This floss is fantastic for tightly spaced teeth! It glides easily and works better than any other floss I’ve tried. Very satisfied.
Does exactly what it’s supposed to. Works great and no complaints.

This supplement effectively lowers blood pressure and is reasonably priced. Highly recommend!
Lovely product! It reminds me of Tibetan temple wheels and brings a touch of elegance.
A nice unit, but both leads can only be set to the same strength. It’s a limitation for using on different areas, but it’s still effective.
This portable pump is easy to use, clean, and charge. It’s a great value, and I even preferred it over the hospital pump while my baby was in the NICU.
This maca root powder is fresh and smells as expected. It’s a good organic option and meets my needs perfectly.
This toothbrush is incredibly soft and great for sensitive gums. However, it feels more like brushing with a sponge than bristles. I’ll stick with my electric toothbrush.
The charge lasts forever, and it heats quickly. By far the best I’ve owned, even compared to pricier models.
This product doesn’t hold suction and is poorly made. I wouldn’t recommend it.
Great product at a good price. Very satisfied!
This has been a staple for all three of my children. It’s gentle, easy to apply, and works quickly. Highly recommend!

It cleans as it should. Works well for its purpose.
This supplement is packed with elderberry and essential vitamins, making it a great addition to your health routine. Perfect to have on hand.
This turmeric supplement is a powerhouse! With over 2000 mg per serving and added black pepper for absorption, it’s highly effective for inflammation and joint pain. Organic and well worth it.

These work amazingly! They removed mildew from my golf cart seat and even scratches off the basement wall. Super versatile product!
This supplement is a must-have for anyone concerned about vision health, especially with conditions like degenerative retinal disease. I’ve been taking it for years, and my eyesight hasn’t worsened. Great for diabetics to help prevent complications like glaucoma and cataracts.
A handy item to keep around for DIY adapters. Simple but effective.
Scrub buds are always reliable, and these are priced better than other sellers. Very satisfied.
These pads are disappointingly thin compared to ones I’ve ordered before. They’re not what I was expecting.

This has been a great help to me! Much appreciated.
This brand consistently delivers quality products backed by clinical studies. This one keeps me alert and focused without any jitters—smooth and subtle effects. Love it!
I’ve taken omega-3 supplements for decades, and this brand offers excellent concentration, quality, and value. At $0.14 per pill in this two-pack, it’s the most affordable option for the dosage. Highly recommended.
This has improved our sleep so much! We use it in the bedroom, and it works wonders.
Great value with lots of sound options. The best part? It doesn’t loop noticeably.
This nail care set is functional but not high-quality. The toenail clippers were the best part, but the other tools were rough and left my nails jagged. Not gift-worthy, but okay for personal use.
This is perfect for use between chiropractic adjustments. Helps a lot!
This made my grandson’s first birthday so special. Perfect purchase!
This works well for sore muscles and doubles as a face roller. Great multipurpose product.
Does the job, but you can find similar products for less.
Just as advertised. No issues.
This saved me from replacing my waterpik, though it has some of the same design flaws. The door hinge broke, but it’s still usable. Not perfect, but better than buying a whole new device.
Helped a lot with tension in my shoulders. Very happy with it.
I mix this with plain yogurt, and it blends perfectly. Works great!
Looks like something you’d find at a thrift store. Not impressed with the quality.
This thick, curved pillow has been great for my son’s sports injury. It relieves his neck pain and helps him stretch his muscles. Very effective and great value.
These shiny black jasper stones with Archangel sigils are exactly what I wanted for my healing work. Beautiful and just as described.
Lightweight and comfortable in hand, but it squeaks badly and doesn’t clean glass well. Leaves streaks, and the price isn’t justified.
The foam is much easier to clean compared to other materials. Very convenient!
This isn’t noisy at all; it has a soothing hum that helps my baby fall asleep. It makes the air feel fresher, even in a clean house. I’ve already bought another for my child’s room. Works wonders near trash cans or diaper pails, too!
Excellent organic essential oil at a fantastic price. Highly recommend it!
Item was exactly as described. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
I’ve used this product for years, and it’s great for an active lifestyle. Sadly, it’s not vegan, so I had to stop using it. If that’s not an issue for you, it’s worth trying.
I wouldn’t buy this again. The teeth on the flat iron caught in my hair, and I had to cut them off with wire cutters.
Smells great and keeps my yoga mat clean. The included towel is a nice bonus!
These stick on Hershey’s Kisses for days and match a burlap theme perfectly. Great price and quantity for events like weddings or rehearsal dinners.
Very disappointed. The temperature display was inaccurate, and the brush left my hair frizzy. I’d like a refund.
These don’t provide much compression and feel more like snug socks. I couldn’t return them, so I’m stuck with them now.
This protein shot is a novel concept I enjoy. The flavor is pleasant, and it’s convenient to take on the go. A good product overall.
This curling brush worked fine on my thin hair, but it didn’t stand out compared to others. It’s functional but not extraordinary.
Perfect size to carry with me. Very practical.

The size is just right for everyone. Very versatile.
They’re okay—serve their purpose, but nothing special.
This seat cushion works well if you shift around or move a lot, but it does collapse occasionally. Decent option if you need a bit of flexibility.
Worst car cleaner ever. It left a white residue that was impossible to remove. I’m returning it—do not buy this product!
Puffs Plus Tissues are a staple in my home, especially during the cold season. Auto-delivery ensures I never run out. Great deal!
This balloon was perfect! It stayed inflated for weeks and was large and beautiful. Ideal for birthdays or special occasions.
My 7-year-old loves this! It tastes great and is packed with organic vitamins and minerals. Definitely a win!
This shaving soap is fantastic. It lathers richly, smells like an old-time barbershop, and offers a close shave with minimal irritation. The heavy-duty container keeps it fresh. Excellent value for the quality.
This vegan D3 is a potent option, doubling the standard dose. I take it sparingly to supplement my daily multivitamin, especially in winter. Good quality and long-lasting!
The glue tabs didn’t hold, so I had to use pins. The letters require some assembly, but it’s manageable. Overall, not a big deal.
Works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.
Outstanding product quality and customer service experience! Very pleased with both.
This product works well, but it's a bit small, so it may require multiple uses to achieve a fully curled head of hair. I wouldn't recommend it for longer hair types.
Fish burps at all times of day—morning, evening, and at supper! With this bottle, you can enjoy fish burps whenever you like.
Turmeric is beneficial for digestion, cholesterol, inflammation, and potentially for diabetes. This comes as pure powder, which is easy to incorporate into meals or smoothies. Plus, it contains manganese and iron, which are good for blood and bone health.
Great product and fast delivery. I look forward to the next purchase.
After trying many sleep masks, this one ranks in my top ten. It's comfortable, easy to wear, and doesn't feel bulky. The adjustable strap is a plus, and it washes well in a lingerie bag. It blocks out light effectively, and it doesn’t interfere with my long lashes.
Works fine, but the caps on the larger bottles don’t always align properly. I’ve had a couple of spills because of it, although the smaller bottles don’t have this issue.
It’s an investment, but well worth the price. Following the instructions yields excellent results.
Recommended by my doctor for corneal edema treatment. It's thicker than other options, but it keeps my eyes clearer than anything else. Although the application is a bit cumbersome, it works wonders for me.
This probiotic was suggested by my acupuncturist to boost my immune system. I’ve been using it daily for two years, and it has helped shorten the duration of colds.
I love the scent—it's not overpowering like others. It also keeps bugs away. I used it around drinks to prevent ants and placed it near windows and doors to keep them from entering.
The size is perfect, with a large handle and ample space for collecting lint. It’s a practical design!
These long gloves have been a lifesaver for my dry, cracked hands due to constant handwashing. They fit snugly and protect my hands while doing dishes. They come in a set of three, perfect for the season.
Great price and a fantastic product!
I’ve always had rough feet due to genetics and wearing flip-flops often. After using this tool, my feet feel much smoother. It works well in conjunction with a blade shaver. The extra sandpaper discs are a nice touch, too.
The suction cup is incredibly strong! It holds the shower in place, making it easy for me to sit and wash my hair.
These little lanyards are a great way to keep track of my masks and keep them clean.
The seal was open upon arrival, but I'm pretty sure it's fine otherwise. Overall, I love this product!
I drink a lot of coffee, so I thought this would help, but I didn’t see a noticeable whitening effect. However, it did work well for my sensitive teeth.
This space heater is a game-changer! It keeps me warm without drying out the air. The heating pads for the legs and back are excellent, helping me feel cozy and easing any muscle soreness.
I bought these long reusable gloves during the glove shortage, and they’ve been great for cleaning. While they’re not as form-fitting as nitrile gloves, they’re perfect for wiping down groceries.
The sweet orange, neroli, and thyme essential oil blend fills the room with a pleasant aroma. It's a bit pricey for the size, but I love the scent, so I’m happy with the purchase.
I really enjoy the Frankincense and Myrrh, but the price feels a bit high for such a small bottle. I would recommend it, especially when it’s on sale.
Perfect for various uses, including colloidal silver applications. It’s been durable for months, and I’m still using it without any issues.
Fast delivery and consistent performance.
Easy to inflate, especially with a pump. Great value for 2020 decorations, although using it without a pump might be difficult.
This product has its pros and cons, but it’s ultimately useful. The size is compact, and it’s easy to operate. I do wish the lighting was dimmer, and some of the sounds could be more soothing, but overall it works well.
I had a negative reaction to this product, experiencing increased anxiety. It didn’t work for me, and I ended up unable to return it, losing the total cost.
Fits perfectly and serves its purpose well.
Biz is still the best laundry additive, hands down. I’ve been using it for decades, and it works wonders on tough stains. I bought a pack of four boxes, so I’m set for the long haul.
Good quality and reliable.
These towels are great for cleaning mats and deodorizing. Although mine didn’t come with the promised six towels, the customer service was fantastic and sent me the replacements promptly.
Bought these masks for my husband, who’s a larger guy. They fit well and are comfortable, especially with the neck strap. I ordered one for myself, hoping it’ll be more breathable for me.
This product didn’t help with my shoe slipping as expected.
The paper towels are incredibly soft and feature a beautiful design. They’re not just functional—they also serve as decorative items in my room.

These air fresheners smell just like the ones from the car wash and last a long time.
The large size is perfect, and it does the job efficiently.

These pills are easy to swallow, though the smell is a bit off-putting at first. I haven’t seen any noticeable effects yet, but the price is reasonable compared to other probiotics.
These insoles revived my sheepskin boots, making them fluffy again. I’ll get more use out of my boots for another year thanks to this product.
These gloves fit well and are great for household chores and outdoor work. They’re especially useful for washing delicate glass items, as they provide extra grip.
Perfect for smaller bathrooms where space is limited.
This product is much gentler than similar items I’ve tried, especially for kids. It’s easy to use, works quickly, and is simple to clean.
Amazing product—very satisfied with the results. Thank you!
This product contains intestinal binding fillers, which might explain the lack of a full ingredient label. I can’t tolerate magnesium stearate due to adverse reactions, so I’ll be avoiding this one.
These straps are a great solution for my son, who wears glasses and hearing aids. They make it easy to pull his mask up and down without disturbing his hearing aids. The adjustable straps and easy cleaning are added benefits.
This product didn’t help whiten my teeth as I expected, and it was tasteless.
This 5-head electric razor gives me the closest shave I’ve ever had, better than any other electric razor I’ve used. It includes several useful attachments, and I appreciate the ease of cleaning and charging. It’s also comfortable to hold and doesn’t cause irritation.
I used this product for a few days, but the plastic's firmness was uncomfortable. While the instructions mentioned the hardness and suggested it might take some getting used to, I ended up with headaches after short use. I decided to keep it and might give it another try later.
It performs as expected.
The taste is unpleasant, but I’m hopeful it will help with stabilizing my gait.
The bristles only reach halfway up my teeth, so my teeth didn’t feel fully cleaned. It’s already in the trash.
The material is too slick, causing food to slip and fall onto the floor.
This product is good and clean, though it doesn't dissolve as easily as other peptide brands I’ve tried. However, I do love their BCAAs!
This product works excellently for our needs.
Great product, and shipping was fast!
I used to reuse styrofoam cartons from the large egg boxes, but after finding these, I’ve never gone back!
We really like these! The taste and consistency are great, and they’re $5 cheaper per bag than Vitamin Shoppe. Plus, they were delivered right to my door—awesome!
These work great, though I’m not fond of the bubble gum flavor. Luckily, it’s not overpowering.
The compression is incredibly soothing.
I’m new to Joon X Moon and find their products very giftable. The packaging is beautiful, and their scrubs and bubble bath fizz formulas make for a relaxing end to the week. The lavender scent is strong but not too medicinal, while the champagne scent has a fruity undertone. The soft, plentiful bubbles are soothing and help create a relaxing atmosphere. I love how the bottles look in my bathroom too. I find it safer than glass alternatives.
The little packets were difficult to tear open, requiring scissors or a knife. The flavor was okay, and it seemed to help with skin hydration. I've had better and worse mix-ins.
I've been taking milk thistle for years to protect my liver from daily stressors like alcohol and ibuprofen. This product is as effective as any, with a high concentration and a clean smell. At 120 capsules per bottle, it’s an excellent value. My recent blood tests came back normal, and my doctor was pleased. I trust this product!
They work really well.
I switched from a more expensive tooth powder to this one. It works similarly in terms of cleanliness but dries out my mouth the second I use it. The mint flavor isn’t strong, and it doesn’t freshen my breath, so I ended up using mouthwash. I’ve had this for over a month and still have plenty left, but I’m undecided about reordering or going back to the previous product.
I bought this for my mother-in-law, who suffers from insomnia. She absolutely loves the stars on the ceiling, saying it reminded her of camping as a child. The soothing sounds and sparkling stars have helped her sleep better!
The colors match the picture—vibrant black and grey. The material is a bit stiff, and it feels tight, which makes it somewhat hard to use. The lathering is okay, but it’s getting better after a few uses.
Works great and arrived quickly!
My puppies ignored this, which was disappointing since they chew on everything else. They do like pig ears, though.
I bought this towel wrap to use after showers while getting ready for work. It’s thin but absorbent, and the pretty blue color is nice. The Velcro is easy to use, and while the length could be shorter for my preference, it still does the job well!
I’ve never liked sponges until now. The Magic Eraser works wonders on my washable wallpaper and chrome fixtures, even without vinegar. It didn’t scratch or leave marks. While I don’t use it for everything, it’s a great tool for specific cleaning tasks.
I’ve only had these for a day, but I love them! I work outside all day, and it was annoying to constantly switch between sunglasses and readers. Now I don’t have to unless I’m in low light. Highly recommend!
This is pretty expensive for what you get, and honestly, it’s not that exciting. If you're after a good laugh and don’t mind spending more, go ahead.
This is a powder supplement that you mix with water. The mixing process isn’t perfect, with some clumps remaining, but it doesn’t bother me much. The taste is tolerable, and I’ll continue using it. As for digestion, I can’t tell yet, but I find the research behind it interesting.
I have several towel wraps, and they are really convenient, especially when I’m getting ready instead of wearing a bulky robe. They’re absorbent, stay in place, and are easy to wash.
These gloves are fantastic! They’re thick enough that I don’t have to worry about tearing them, even with my clumsy hands.
My wife loves this lotion for her dry, scaly feet. It works wonders, even though she doesn’t have diabetes.
Initially skeptical, I found this product easy to apply after showering thanks to the moisture still on my skin. It goes on clear and doesn’t stain towels. I love how smooth it feels and will replace my regular lotion with this one from now on.
I had high hopes for this product based on the description, but it didn’t work out. The mask is soft, but the nose bridge presses too hard, affecting my breathing. The strap tangles in my hair, and loosening it doesn’t help. The weighted padding caused discomfort, so I had to return it. Maybe it’s better for those who don’t have sensitive sleep needs.
Bought this for my 76-year-old mother, who has trouble hearing her cell phone. It works perfectly, making the ringer loud enough for her to hear throughout the condo. She’s very satisfied!
This toe nail clipper is excellent—much better than typical clippers, offering a clean cut every time. However, I wouldn’t recommend it for fingernails, as it may leave a rough edge.
Has the company started using less lotion in this product? It seems just like using regular Kleenex puffs now.
This is a reliable product, and I prefer it over liquid versions. I’ll definitely order it again when I run out. Great price too!
These run small. My son, who wears a size 9.5 shoe, found them tight. Larger individuals may find them uncomfortable.
After installing this onto my Waterpik, I noticed a slight leak from the handle down the hose, although it’s just a few drops per use. The pressure also seems weaker than the original.
I bought this for my sister, who’s into special effects makeup. The description said it was ammonia-free, but I found ammonia hydroxide and ammonia listed in the ingredients. She’ll probably still like it, but I won’t buy it again.
Normally, I just clean my mat with soap and water, but that makes it too slippery. This cleaner, which comes with a microfiber cloth, is perfect. A quick spray or two cleans the surface without losing grip. Highly recommend it!
This protein bar could have been a great dessert option, but the mass-market ingredients leave a weird aftertaste. While it’s fine while eating, the aftertaste is a reminder of its artificial content. The packaging is great, but I’d prefer a “real food” version.
Too much noise here to sleep!
The description was accurate, and shipping was fast.
Too tight.
Didn’t work for me.
Exactly as described—stays true to the basics.
I was excited to try these tooth cleaning sticks, and they didn’t disappoint. The flavor is hard to describe, but once chewed, they form a brush-like texture. While it’s not a replacement for a toothbrush, it’s a great supplement for freshening your mouth.
I’m not sure if the good reviews are paid, but this item didn’t work for me. A waste of $20. I have wavy hair, and it’s usually easy to manage, but this brush didn’t straighten it at all.
I get the same results from the ones I buy at Target. I wouldn’t purchase these again.
My two cats often suffer from runny eyes due to allergies or colds. This product has been very helpful.
I bought the "Got Milk" straws at Target for $1.79 per pack, and my kids loved them. Since I wasn’t going to Target for a while, I purchased these as a mix of flavors. The kids enjoy them, and the container is a nice bonus—it snaps closed, unlike a Ziploc bag. It’s definitely worth the purchase!
I purchase these regularly each month and have no issues with them. The added energy boost is beneficial. The only thing missing is iron, but as far as I know, daily vitamins typically don’t contain it.
Bought these for my husband, and he really enjoys them. We typically use them about three times before discarding.
Convenient to carry and functions perfectly.
The texture is unusual, and it's not as pleasant as expected.
Lathers well and has a handy pump for easy use. It moisturizes, but the scent reminds me of a cheap pina colada that I regret purchasing.
Works well with all smoking parts. The extra $2 for the cap holes for stems and bowls is definitely worth it.
This glycerin is a great addition to shaving cream! It helps the lather stay thick and rich, especially when using a shaving brush. The quart size is a good value. My only minor issue is the lack of a controlled dispensing lid, but I solved it by using a squeeze bottle with a dropper.
I’m treating my C-Spine injury with decompression therapy at my doctor’s office. This device provides support and decompression at home, and it’s easy to use. The adjustable tension is a nice feature. It’s a bit uncomfortable on the ears, but I’m getting used to it.
This product offers a nice blend of collagen from various sources (bovine, marine, poultry, eggshell), giving it a variety of collagen types. The price is higher than some, but it’s reasonable for the amount (8 grams per serving). It might have a slight taste or smell, especially from the eggshell, but it’s not noticeable in smoothies or flavored coffee. I would appreciate it if the nutritional info were displayed more clearly on the packaging. Overall, a solid product.
These smell fantastic and work well for moisturizing. They’re fun to use in the bath, and we enjoyed all of them!
A bit greasy, but it works well.
I bought this pillow mat for my partner who likes to fall asleep to music, podcasts, and videos. I can’t block out that noise, but the pillow mat does the trick. It’s comfortable and effective, although not ideal when sitting up in bed. We use both the mat and headphones to get the best of both worlds.
These tissues work well and are gentle on dry noses.
Compact yet powerful.
Comfortable fit and a great value for the price.
I’ve been using this turmeric for over a month, and it’s a good product.
This scale is awesome. It syncs with my Fitbit and transfers weight and body fat data directly to my phone. It took a while to set up, but it works great, and I love it!
This collar is larger than most adult adjustable collars, and the Velcro on the strap came off after just half an hour. It’s not nearly as good as the ones used in ambulances (I’m a former EMT). The only positive is the olive drab color instead of the usual blue and yellow.
I bought these for my husband because his shoes were rubbing against his ankle. They fit well and stay in place. Easy to wash by hand and dries overnight. A good product that I would purchase again.
This is an easy and tasty way to get zinc, which is great for health. Just a few drops a day and you’re set—no need for pills. Good value for the price.
Can you tell it’s fish oil? Not really. The orange flavor masks the taste well, though there’s a slight aftertaste. Still, it's tolerable and a great alternative if you don’t like fish oil pills. Decent Omega-3 content, and overall, it works fine.
I’ve been using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks, and it’s been effective. It has a nice taste, and it leaves my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean. I’ve also noticed some whitening. Three tubes for $18.99 is a good deal.
Doesn't work every time.
Perfect for a variety of holiday gifts.
Great product, fast delivery, and very satisfied.
As expected, good quality bandaids.
I received these as a gift, but they’re not very comfortable to walk in. The massage feature is barely noticeable when standing, and the buzzing is annoyingly loud when sitting, making it hard to hear the TV. Not recommended.
My cats knocked my old one off the desk, and the lid cracked. This replacement is similar, but it was hard to assemble and disassemble, and it rattled. I used some Vaseline around the grooves, and now it works perfectly. Problem solved!
The taste is fine.
Doesn’t scrub as expected.
I prefer a more organized approach to storing batteries. This holder is a great solution to keep batteries neatly organized and easily accessible. I even carry a couple in my hiking pack. It’s a well-built, efficient product. Highly recommended.
Do not waste your money. These towels wrinkle up when wet, and the center never dries. It’s like trying to wash with a piece of wrinkled cardboard.
I bought this based on my doctor’s recommendation, and it works great!
These disposable masks are standard 3-ply masks. They have comfortable ear straps, a moldable nose wire, and come in a pack of 50 for $8.99. At just 18 cents per mask, it’s a great deal, though they are designed for one-time use.
The flavor is great and it keeps me feeling energized and helps with digestion. I take it daily.
This product works well, but I don’t like that it sometimes leaves pink residue if not fully wiped off. I’m not sure if it’s a cleaning issue or the product itself, but it can look unclean if not thoroughly cleaned.
I expected this product to be larger, but it was smaller than I imagined. After using it once, I realized it didn’t give me the flawless skin I wanted. I prefer washing my face with my hands instead.
These fit my son’s toothbrush perfectly and work just as well as the original ones.
I was looking for a good price on this type of device and found it here. It’s sturdy, heavy, and effective. The different heads and adjustable speed are great. The battery life is good too, lasting for a week without needing a recharge.
I use magnesium powder every night before sleep. This product comes in a well-packed glass jar, and the flavor is pleasant, with no overwhelming sweeteners. It’s helpful for relaxation, and I appreciate that it’s not loaded with extra additives. I just wish the jar had been a bit fuller.
Very difficult to pull apart tissues.
Quick delivery, and the quality is good enough!
This hydrogen peroxide cleaner works surprisingly well. I cleaned around the door knobs, and the dirt seemed to disappear without transferring to the paper towel. It's impressive!
The capsule was deflated when I received it. My physical therapist confirmed it was lacking enough gelatin for proper performance.
Always running out of these. Now I have enough to keep a box in every room.
It works for me!
Great product with multiple uses! Works well on beards, and I also use one for dog massages and hair removal.
This was a reorder.
70% alcohol was hard to find and more expensive during the COVID scare.
I’ve tried several apple cider vinegar gummies, and these are my least favorite. The flavor is just okay, and the texture isn’t very gummy. While I appreciate that they contain the mother, it’s pretty much the only advantage over others, aside from a small amount of vitamins B9 and B12.
This set contains two travel-sized pill cases with a slim profile, each featuring six compartments and 54 labels. Each compartment is equipped with a secure clasp that ensures a tight seal. As shown in the image, I could fit up to 20 of my 50mcg D3 tablets in a single compartment. The compact and portable design stands out as the key highlight. Keep in mind, larger pills, particularly ones that are more substantial, may not fit in the compartments. The lids do not stay fully open while inserting or removing pills, so they will remain partially open. It’s also worth noting that the pill case should be inserted with the side featuring the finger nubs facing upwards for correct placement. At $8.99, it’s a great deal, coming out to just $4 per case.
Solidly built! However, I do wish the handle was slightly longer.
Excellent purchase! Very satisfied with this.
I’ve used these in the past, and they work well for buffing the edges of my nails, especially since they tend to chip. Given the affordable price, they perform quite well, and I would recommend them.
I typically use an enzyme-based product to neutralize pet accidents, but I’ve also been using this on the patio where the pets go. It works for eliminating odors, though it takes some time to dry.
I suffer from low blood pressure, and my cardiologist advised increasing my salt intake. While adding salt to my meals didn’t raise my blood pressure enough, these pills have been more effective. I now take a prescription medication to regulate my blood pressure, but these pills were a helpful interim solution.
It’s a bit tricky to use if you have thicker hair like mine. Personally, I still prefer my round bun maker. This may work better for those with thinner hair.
I bought these petals for an ash scattering ceremony, and they were perfect. They looked exactly as shown in the picture, smelled great, and there was a generous amount. Even though it was for a somber occasion, these petals added a beautiful touch. I’m really happy with my purchase.
I applied this on ^04 bisque, let it dry overnight, and then glazed it to ^6 the next day. It worked well, preventing most of the glaze from getting on the waxed areas. Excess glaze wipes off easily with a wet towel. It melts away leaving the unfinished clay after firing. I will buy this again when I run out.
These gloves are both pretty and durable. The purple pairs are lined, while the white and yellow ones are unlined. Both pairs are comfortable and robust, ideal for a variety of tasks like cleaning, gardening, or washing the dogs. The palms and fingers are textured for grip, and the gloves come up over the wrist. They are latex-free and have a stylish scalloped edge. Very pleased with them.
Great value! I use this facial brush twice a day, and it works well. I also use it to massage my husband's forehead and back, and he loves it. It can’t handle much pressure, but for the price, it’s an excellent product. The stone attachment and other two accessories are not very useful, though. I would have liked another brush instead.
The directions were not clear, so I had to watch a YouTube tutorial. I also got stuck in my hair a few times, which was painful and caused tangles. The battery life didn’t last as long as advertised—it only lasted for 6 strands before it was at 50%. It would have been better if it included an outlet plug, as I couldn’t finish without it dying. It’s only worth it if you have thin hair.
Didn’t do much cleaning for me.
A fantastic product for everyday use!
My skin feels smoother and looks clearer after using this.
This lamp is very well-made. It starts easily and produces a hot, steady flame. It’s perfect for lighter tasks like heating test tubes or sterilizing tools. If you need a larger flame, a wick-based lamp would be better. I use Everclear as fuel to avoid toxic fumes. Overall, it’s a solid product.
I’ve been mixing this powder into my morning smoothies for added energy and nutrition. It blends seamlessly without altering the taste. I highly recommend it, though I wish the packaging were a little larger, and it doesn’t include a measuring tool. Just something to keep in mind when ordering. Note: I received this item as a free gift or at a discount, and my review reflects my honest opinion.
This powder mixes well with other foods and helps with digestion. I use it daily, usually mixing it with cucumber.
Comfortable to sleep in, and I love the fact that these are connected, so they won’t get lost.
These inserts are a great recommendation from my doctor, and they’ve been a fantastic addition to my routine. I’ll continue using them.
The toilet paper roll is humorous when opened, but I found it quite pricey for the size.
My 7-year-old granddaughter loves wearing these masks every night. She used to wear plain black ones, but now she insists on these fun designs. Sometimes, I even catch her wearing them on top of her head during the day!
These are being used in my home security system, and they perform just as well as Duracell.
This product is excellent for boosting blood circulation, and it’s much more affordable than some other brands. If you engage in sports or high activity, I highly recommend it. I use it for jogging and weight training.
It does an okay job, but if you're supposed to prick your finger, you will need lancelets.
These are fantastic! Be sure to measure your calves before purchasing, as the fit depends on your calf size. There’s a great variety of colors to choose from as well.
These are easy to apply and remove. However, they can get a bit slippery if your face becomes sweaty or oily. They are thin, so they don’t affect the fit of your glasses much, except for providing a little extra stability.
Expensive, but they do the job.
These are so delicious that I find it hard to stop at just one. They didn’t really help my throat, but they distracted me enough to take my mind off it. Unfortunately, they’re overpriced for what they are.
Pretty basic but work perfectly fine. Considering the quantity, this is a good deal.
These are the same as those sold at my gym for 50 cents a pair. They are a little awkward to use, but since they’re disposable after five minutes, they get the job done. Plus, they avoid tan lines.
A great value for glass cleaners.
Perfect!
This is my third order, and we both love it. The taste is great, and it’s even better when mixed with some orange juice. It’s a fantastic way to get extra electrolytes and vitamins, and we’ll continue buying it.
This is heavy-duty and perfect for the task.
I can't live without this product!
My 6-year-old loves wearing this sleep mask. It’s cute, comfortable, and stays in place all night. The soft material and Disney design make it extra special for her.
I’ve been adding collagen powder to my coffee for over a year, and I’m really happy with this one. It dissolves quickly with no clumping and is undetectable in my coffee. Since starting, I’ve noticed improvements in my knees and lower back. I’ll keep using it.
Using this product in my car has helped relieve the pain in my legs. I’m very grateful for it!
I purchased this product to clean out my coffee pot, which had accumulated seven years of build-up. After soaking it for five hours, I was able to pour out the residue, and the pot was sparkling clean. My coffee tastes amazing now, and I’ll definitely be repurchasing this.
Thumbs up!
I’ve been using this for years, but the price has skyrocketed from $40 to almost $70. They’ve also increased the scoop size without adding more product, so now I’m using twice as much for double the price. I’m not happy with this change, and I won’t be buying again.
The best wrap I’ve tried!
These bars are surprisingly tasty. They’re perfect for a quick breakfast or post-workout snack. They’re filling and keep me full until lunch. The texture is smooth, and the peanut butter flavor is delicious. Great protein content and calorie ratio—highly recommend.
I suffer from chronic pain and needed a seat for my shower. I was worried about it looking medical, but this little bath stool is perfect. It’s cute, comfortable, and sturdy, and it doesn’t take up much space. People actually think I bought it for a spa experience, which is a bonus! It holds up to 300lbs, and I feel secure using it.
This seems like a quality product. I mixed it with water, ice, and frozen banana for a quick protein smoothie. It tasted great and was very filling.
Good product overall.
This is the third brand I’ve tried, and it stands out as the best. It’s fresher, tastes greener, and feels more alive. My only minor complaint is that it’s a little tricky to get rid of lumps, but the taste makes up for it. I wouldn’t switch brands.
A practical and useful tool that I use every day.
Very simple to use, and it works exceptionally well.
I’ve been using these on sunglasses without a nose grip, and they work just as advertised. They’re a must-have during travel, as you'll need to swap them out occasionally due to sunscreen or extended use during activities.
I’ve been using this for my back pain, and it’s been quite effective in providing relief.
I haven’t had the chance to use this product yet, as I didn't experience any blister issues during my vacation. However, someone else used it, and they mentioned it helped soothe their foot. The blister never fully developed.
My dentist recommended this type of toothbrush, and I really enjoy the gentle feeling it gives on my sensitive gums.
This is an excellent addition for my bedside commode. It’s just the right fit and has been really convenient.
The oil takes a little longer to absorb, but I love the fragrance and how it leaves my skin feeling. The scent reminds me of a rich jasmine aroma.
This kit is a lifesaver! I keep one in my belt and the other in my bag. It’s always on hand when I need it, and I couldn’t be happier with its convenience.
This product exceeded my expectations! The handle is perfect for reaching everywhere, and it works beautifully for what I need.
These earplugs do a great job at blocking out noise, but they’re not ideal for sleeping. The hard plastic makes them uncomfortable when lying on my side, and I find myself dealing with some itching. For outdoor work, though, they are highly effective.
These hanging witches were a quirky addition to our home decor. My wife chose one for its charmingly ugly design, and I ended up buying two more. They’re well-crafted with burlap dresses and painted faces, and they bring a fun vibe to the room.
Pros: Magnetic closure works perfectly. Well-made and a great value.Cons: I can’t think of any drawbacks!
This tray is a perfect fit for certain walkers. It comes with a removable liner that’s easy to clean. However, ensure that your walker has a crossbar at the top for it to work correctly. It’s not compatible with all walker models, but there’s a different version for those without the upper crossbar.
These help alleviate bursitis in my elbows by preventing accidental hits, which can cause pain.
I bought this tape after my physical therapist used it to help realign my knee cap during exercises. It’s been incredibly effective, providing support and reducing pain. After consistent use, my knee is back in place and functioning well.
The best tongue scraper I’ve ever found! The company is also extremely friendly and responsive. I’ll definitely buy this product again.
Not sure what alien material this is, but it works wonders on enamel tubs and tile showers, especially white ones. Simply spray on tub cleaner, wipe with a Mr. Clean eraser, and prepare to be amazed by the results!
I purchased this for my husband, and he absolutely loves it! He uses it every day, and it’s become an essential part of his routine.
Everything is exactly as expected. No issues at all.
After a windy, rainy day, I accidentally rubbed the side of my Audi against a cart while loading groceries. This product removed the black mark that stretched across my passenger side with just light rubbing. So glad I had this on hand!
These are the perfect size for me—strong, soft, and exactly what I needed.
I initially thought these would be great for playing golf, but they weren’t as comfortable as I expected. They work better on soft, wet ground. On harder ground, the cleats made my shoes uncomfortable, and I wouldn’t recommend using them for anything with air bladders. Overall, I had to give them a thumbs down.
A great addition to my first aid kit! It’s always handy to have around.
This product has made camping and travel much easier for me. It allows me to clean clothes on the go, and I can conveniently carry it in my pocket.
This product works great—exactly what I needed.
When I make my morning coffee, if I don’t use powdered MCT oil, I rely on these handy single-serve packets. It gives my coffee the kick I need. Though it doesn’t emulsify perfectly, I just stir it and enjoy.
The product works, but the small loops on the belt were a bit of a downside for me.
It worked well for a week, but then it broke. My son, who has longer hair, used it for soccer and liked the fit initially. Unfortunately, it started tearing after a week of use. We switched to a more durable, stretchable fabric alternative, and it worked much better.
This supplement supports natural testosterone production and boosts libido. While I’m unsure about significant increases in testosterone, I’ve noticed other effects like increased dopamine levels. However, some ingredients like L-Dopa and DHEA can cause anxiety and aggression if taken in excess. Overall, it’s not a miracle worker but may offer some minor benefits.
This stand is a high-quality, stable option for the pelvis and spine. Some reviews mentioned confusion about whether it included the pelvis, but considering the price, this stand offers great value for its purpose.
This MCT oil powder tastes okay. It took a few days to get used to, but now it works fine for me.
This product is just as described and works exactly the same as those found in stores. Great value.
Not the cheapest, but I see it as an investment in our health!
I’ve had trouble remembering to take this as instructed, so I can’t report any results yet. If this continues, I won’t be purchasing again.
I appreciate receiving quality products delivered right to my door. It's always a pleasure to get exactly what I expect.
These gift bags are durable and reusable, which makes them eco-friendly. They come in lovely glittery colors like silver, gold, and rose gold. I love how they look, but I do wish they offered more variety in the gift tags, as they only have “Thank You” on them.
This didn’t work well for my cat problems.
Seems to do what it’s supposed to do with no issues.
This roller is perfect for self-use or for a helping hand during physical therapy. It’s comfortable, smooth, and effective for relieving muscle tension, especially on the thighs and calves.
A disappointing purchase. It was noisy and didn’t improve air quality after using it in a small walk-in closet for several days.
A great alternative to bleach tablets—does the job effectively.
Due to arthritis and other joint issues, I can no longer easily wear some of my shoes. This product has allowed me to start wearing shoes that I thought I’d have to retire for good. It's become an invaluable tool for me.
The case is well-constructed and does an excellent job of storing fragile glassware at an affordable price.
I tried using this product to cut my own hair, but it didn’t work well—it kept slipping.
After using these pills for over three weeks, I’ve noticed improved firmness in my breasts, but not much change in size. I plan to keep using them and will update my review after a month to see if there's a more significant difference.
I’m very pleased with this product. It worked as described, and I’ll definitely order again.
Using alcohol and salt has worked just as well as this product for my needs.
The material feels a bit cheap and doesn’t look the best, but it works. The ombre color is nice, though it gives off a somewhat inexpensive look.
Fits perfectly, even for someone with a larger frame. It holds the sensor securely in place, though the green color is a bit brighter than I expected.
I can finally carry my E-pen with ease. The case is durable, and I love how accessible it is.
I’ve been using this product for 20 years, and it’s fantastic. It gives my hair a fuller, thicker appearance, and it’s one of the best hair waxes I’ve found. I just wish it didn’t have the lavender scent, as I no longer want to associate it with my hair.
This bath was incredibly relaxing. While I typically enjoy traditional lavender scents, this one leans more towards a floral fragrance than a lavender one. It did bubble and fizz, creating an inviting atmosphere for a soothing soak.
It's just a simple straw, and as long as it allows liquid to pass through, it's good to go! The color is nice too.
The cafe latte flavor is fantastic and blends effortlessly, offering a delicious taste! However, I was disappointed to discover it contains Sucralose (Splenda), which I try to avoid. But, the flavor is so good and it’s packed with nutrients that I might overlook that! After taking a nap, though, I woke up with a lingering aftertaste that wouldn't go away even after brushing. The artificial sweetener makes this product less enjoyable, which is unfortunate because otherwise, it's tasty. I wish they'd either left it unsweetened or used plain sugar.
Pros: I really like the scent. The oil feels luxurious and helps me sleep better. Cons: I can't think of any at all!
The size is almost perfect but could be a tiny bit bigger. I have a small face, and they fit me just right.
I've been using Skidmore products for years, and they've consistently delivered amazing results. For example, I once applied a polyurethane coating to my butcher block dining table, and it was a disaster. After sanding it off, I contacted the owner of the Skidmore product, who was incredibly helpful and gave me easy-to-follow instructions. The results were amazing — the table looks even better than when I first bought it. A little goes a long way, and even though I'm not a professional carpenter, this product makes me feel like one. I highly recommend it!
My daughter struggles with blood sugar issues that cause dry mouth, but this toothpaste has made a noticeable difference.
This is an incredibly fast and effective way to remove stains. It works exceptionally well.
Excellent value! This sponge is solid, not just a flimsy piece of netting, and has great durability.
My wife uses this as a white noise machine for sleep. We had an older model that was about 15 years old, and she was concerned it would die soon. So we ordered this backup. It works great, and we love it.
I accidentally ordered a few mini snaps and was initially going to return them. Instead, I decided to find something to go with them, and this bracelet is perfect! It pairs well with my large snap necklace, and I’ve started collecting both mini and large snaps.
I'm very pleased with this sponge. The price is fantastic. My only issue is that it doesn’t apply makeup as well as brushes or fingers do. I don’t contour, so I was hoping this would help apply foundation faster than a brush. It's easy to clean and maintain. If I could rate 4.5 stars, I would, but I gave one to a friend, and they love it too!
All the liquid liposomal vitamin C products I’ve tried have had a strong flavor, which some might want to dilute in water. I take it directly from the bottle, and the citrus flavor is quite strong. However, I prefer liposomal vitamin C (whether in liquid or capsule form) because it stays in your system longer than regular ascorbic acid, which is excreted quickly. The bottle of this product is comparable to others I’ve tried, and there’s nothing negative to report about it.
These bath bombs are great! They genuinely smell like cotton candy, and the color they add to the bathwater is beautiful.
I wouldn’t recommend these. The quality is very cheap, and the reading glasses broke on the first day.
Excellent blood pressure monitor! No more wasting money on batteries. It charges quickly and is just as accurate as battery-operated models. Great value overall.
This product works really well with a pleasant scent. During the monsoon season, there are tons of biting insects around. While it's raining, I’m able to sit outside and watch hummingbirds without being bothered by insects. I’ve already purchased a second bottle and would recommend it.
This product is amazing! It works far better than other brands, even Oxiclean. I highly recommend it!
The effects were somewhat confusing at first. It suppressed my cough momentarily, but I didn’t use it long enough to determine if the results were long-lasting. The package arrived disheveled, with the salt packet open and spilling everywhere. There was also a small crack in the inhaler. I contacted Amazon, and they refunded my money quickly.
While not as good as Aquacel Extra AG, these work well on their own and are much less expensive. They’re a good option for less serious issues, like wounds that aren’t infected with MRSA.
I’ve been seeing a podiatrist for my plantar fasciitis, and I bought these Powerstep ProTech insoles from his office for $50. I found the same ones here for less than half the price! They’re firm and great for any pair of shoes. My doctor recommends replacing them after a year, and I’m already due for a new pair, so I’m glad I found these. I recommend getting properly fitted by a podiatrist, but I’m really happy with my purchase and will definitely order these again.
This product is fantastic! I work in commercial construction, and before using it, I would come home every night with an achy back from wearing a tool belt. With this product, I haven’t had any back pain, except when I forget to wear it. It’s a bit bulky, but it’s totally worth it to protect my lower back.
I can't believe I only just found this! It worked wonders on my blackheads, and after using it for the first time, my nose, chin, and forehead felt smooth and soft. I highly recommend it to anyone with larger pores or blackhead issues. The price is reasonable, and it works perfectly!
Great quality and a solid price point.
Are you looking to get some extra energy out this holiday season? This toy is perfect for any enthusiast, from beginners to experts! It arrives in a standard Amazon box, and while the packaging isn't discreet, it doesn’t give away what's inside. Once unwrapped, you’ll need to wash it before use, and be sure to have some water-based lube ready. The texture inside is amazing, offering a variety of bumps and ridges that provide fantastic sensations. After use, cleaning is easy, and it’s ready for your next session. For the price, it’s a great addition to your collection, and would even make a fun gift for someone!
This item is adorable and well-made. The trees are really cute, and it comes with little clothes pins for each tree. There are no extras, which could be useful in case one gets lost. The burlap string included requires a bit of assembly, but the lettering is not perfect — the final "S" is coming off and some letters are a little crooked. However, the trees arrived in order, so assembling the phrase "Merry Christmas" was quick and easy.
This product is made in China and lacks a specific brand label, so it could be sold by any brand. While the price of $24 seems high for plastic rods and brushes, I recommend shopping around for the best price. The instructions suggest using duct tape to keep the sections together after screwing them in, which is necessary since they can come undone during use. The rods aren’t very flexible, and they’re not ideal for tight turns. The set includes two brushes, with bristles that are both stiff and flexible. Overall, I wish there was a vacuum hose attachment option for cleaning out lint after use.
Great curling iron!
It smells nice but is overpriced for the small 2.5oz bottle. You can get a larger 7oz bottle for just a dollar more. The product description and image are a bit misleading, as I expected to receive several mini bottles for the price.
This product works wonderfully for keeping mosquitoes and flying insects away!
I’ve tried countless hair products over the years, and this natural repair serum is the answer to my hair problems. It controls frizz, adds shine, and helps with dryness, especially since I color my hair. My hair looks shiny and healthy, and I love that the oils used are natural and familiar. This bottle will last a long time, and I’ve even shared it with friends. Highly recommended!
I use a lot of stain removers with my puppy, older dog, and husband, and this one works great! Coffee spills, food stains, and pet accidents are all easily cleaned with this product. We use stain removers almost every time we do laundry.
This product does a good job of muffling sounds, although not completely.
I love this product, aside from the color. It’s effective for relieving pain.
I’ve been using Professor Amos drain cleaner for years, and it always works. I may need to apply it more than once, but it clears my drains every time.
Good product; it smells like curry.
This shower scrubber brush is fantastic! It's soft, easy to grip even when wet, and provides a nice scrub that helps clean deep down. It’s also great for reaching difficult spots. A great value overall.
This toilet anti-odor spray is decent. The scent is a bit weak compared to others, but it’s still effective in reducing odors. It’s best to use it before using the toilet for maximum effectiveness. Overall, this product is just average in terms of potency.
Great buy, but note that the expiration date is approaching sooner than if purchased directly from Dr. Gundry’s site. Still, the price is great for the product.
We needed this specific battery for our security system and couldn’t find it anywhere. The price was reasonable, and I’ll definitely order more in the future. I recommend this Panasonic battery for its long-lasting performance.
This is the best! I will definitely buy more once I run out.
Exactly as pictured. A bit pricey, but it's a nice item!
I bought this shower bench for shaving my legs and for sitting when I’m not feeling well. It fits perfectly in my shower and is sturdy enough for support.
I just needed the clip, but it doesn’t open.
This is a great toothbrush! It’s soft, and my dog tolerated it really well.
These are great files for the price. They file smoothly, leave nails feeling nice, and are washable! I’ve had mine for months, and they haven’t dulled. An excellent purchase.
I bought two of these, as I needed something smaller and more affordable for travel and work. While it’s not as powerful as my expensive one at home, it does the job well. It’s perfect for keeping in my cosmetic bag for quick post-lunch tooth cleaning.
I usually buy generic tissues, but when I’m sick, I want the real deal – Kleenex. These are softer, smoother, and don’t irritate your nose, even with frequent use. The 8-box pack is great to keep around the house.
It’s exactly what I expected. The scent isn’t strong, but it applies well and does the job. I keep it in a plastic bag to prevent it from drying out. So far, it’s worked well for a few weeks.
I ordered the ones for fingers and toes but received only the ones for toes. I’m returning them!
This product has become a lifesaver for managing my eczema spots, especially on areas that are tricky to reach under clothing. It helps with healing those itchy spots, and I can use it on my face for the scales as well. The best part? It's multitasking! Plus, it has a pleasant scent.
I’m really happy with these wipes. They're compact (I keep them in my car) and work well for quick clean-ups on the face or other parts. And no, they're not just for kids!
Don't bother with this. It looked great when I received it, but it doesn’t fit on any of my cabinets. A disappointing purchase.
I wasn’t sure what I was getting into with this beauty and health tool, but after some research and reading the manual, I felt more confident. The bulbs took a while to light up, but they eventually did, and after a bit of trial and error, I adjusted to the buzzing and smell. I’m taking it slow, but I’m optimistic about its potential!
This is my favorite from the Wen collection. It works wonders for me!
The application is difficult, and it’s hard to get the product out of the tube. A caulking gun would have been a much better tool for this!
It’s very thin and doesn’t feel like the brand name. Not quite what I expected.
Finally, no more red nose! The tissues work, but I’d prefer not to spend so much on them in the future.
Super easy to install and clean, plus it offers great value. I’m very happy with this product.
I've ordered these twice and love the soft packaging. It’s convenient to carry around in my car or anywhere in the house. High quality at a great price.
It’s a bit tricky to maneuver at first, but you get used to it with some practice.
I bought these dog-themed matches for my friends and got these cute cat ones for myself. They’re adorable, but the matches themselves are a bit low quality.
My son absolutely loves it! Tastes great!
At first, I wasn’t sure this would fit my HVAC system since my house only has heating and ventilation, but after consulting with the manufacturer, I figured out the perfect setup. Everything arrived in great condition, and the quality is excellent. The installation template was super helpful, and the device is easy to use with useful status lights.
Fantastic product! Cleans my contacts really well.
Exactly as described. It’s a great cleaning item.
I love using this as a night moisturizer. It takes a moment to figure out the right amount, but it absorbs so well that it’s not a hassle. I think you'll love it too!
It makes fantastic party joints, almost two ZigZag papers in length. It’s a bit too long for my daily use, and there’s no extra belt like the smaller RAW rollers, but it’s still a solid choice.
This set has all the essential scents to get you started. You can mix and match to create a personalized aroma for your home. I prefer using a non-water diffuser, and it works well with this set.
Great product!
Bought this as a Christmas gift, and she loves it!
The rice was absolutely delicious.
Super cute! Be warned, though, it takes a bit of time to assemble, but the end result is totally worth it.
Now is the perfect time to support your immune system. These gummies taste great and contain elderberry, propolis, and echinacea, all known to boost immunity. They’re easy to take and soft to chew. Highly recommend!
Indoor air quality is crucial these days, and this gadget is an innovative way to purify the air through your HVAC system. It’s small, easy to install, and works well with an air filter to improve overall air quality. Highly recommend it!
It worked once and then stopped functioning. After that, the lights wouldn’t turn on, and it didn’t produce any heat. Very disappointing. I’m frustrated with the product and the return process.
This shaver has a cool design that my son absolutely loves! It works surprisingly well for a novelty item. However, the brushes don’t clip in securely and can fall out. Still, it’s functional and cool for those into skulls.
Great supplement for teeth and gums! After just four days, my gums are pink again, and the redness is gone. My teeth feel stronger, and they seem whiter, despite my coffee and tea habits. I’m impressed!
I expected a three-pack, but received only one bottle. Always double-check the details! However, I’m eager to see if this appetite-suppressing capsule works for me.
Flavor is my top priority when reviewing energy drinks, and though this one is a bit too sweet for me, it works. I tend to add lime or lemon juice to balance it. On a sunny day, this helped me stay energized through a tough tennis match.
This is essentially a heated pad with a removable shield to retain heat. While it looks like carpet in pictures, it's actually made of a plastic-like material, which is easy to wipe off. The heat is concentrated in the center but still keeps my feet warm along the edges. A great addition to my cold office!
Compared to other rolling machines I’ve used, this one seems durable and is easy to operate. It’s made of hemp plastic, which is reassuring. I’m sure it’ll last a long time. Love it!
This double-sided brush is decent for dog grooming, but after a few weeks, the bristles start falling out. It’s not the most durable option.
The steps are clearly numbered and easy to follow, so there’s no confusion or mistakes. This is the best one I’ve owned!
I was hesitant about buying a cordless clipper for my cat, but this one works great! It dematted his fur quickly, and the LCD display is a nice touch. It charges fast and is easy to clean. Best of all, my cat was so happy I got a kiss afterward!
This product helped with my arm pain from shingles. It was effective enough to help me sleep through the night.
These cotton balls are great, especially for nail polish removal. They hold together well and do the job without falling apart.
It worked great!
Didn’t mean to order this, but I’m glad I did. It works as advertised and is a neat addition to my hair routine. Chi approved!
This set includes two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam earplugs. The masks are soft and adjustable, though there’s no extra molding around the eyes, so some light leaks in. Still, they’re comfortable, and the quality is good.
This new Dreft formula smells amazing—not too strong. The box is also a great eco-friendly option, and I love how easy it is to use. It cleans and freshens clothes and cloth diapers effectively.
I love these Ziploc bags with wide, flat bases! They stand on their own, which makes meal prepping and freezing so much easier. A fantastic design!
These 2 oz cups are cute, but the packaging was subpar. A lot of them were damaged when they arrived, which is a shame since the design is adorable.
This brush is perfect for straightening my daughter's hair. It’s easy to use, heats up quickly, and gets the job done without fuss. The cool handle is a bonus. I’m so happy I found this!
No instructions were included, and I couldn’t figure out what the handles were for. However, I managed to use the sticky tabs to keep the balloons together.
I bought this for international travel, but when it rains, the lotion separates from the insect oil, making it hard to mix them back together.
This product caused my wife’s legs to go numb, which was unexpected and unpleasant.
We installed this for my wife’s knee issues, and the setup was straightforward. The lift worked well, making it easier for her to stand up. The toilet remains stable, and everything’s held up well. Just be aware of the bolts—they needed a bit of adjustment, but overall, it’s a solid product.
These EVA insoles don’t offer as much durability or cushioning as the polyurethane ones. They were too large for my shoes, so I had to trim them, which was a hassle.
These insoles are very comfortable and soft.
This mask is a delight! The glitter adds a nice touch, and it’s light and comfortable. It’s perfect for occasions like doctor’s appointments, as long as they aren’t virtual. It works well for all kinds of outings and adds a cute flair to your look!
After three years, I noticed a leak in the product.
This was a great fit for my device, and now I can finally charge it without any issues. Very happy!
One week update: I was initially unsure about this product, especially with such a challenging task ahead – eliminating the strong odor in a laundry room shared by three dogs. The smell in the room was overpowering, and no air freshener could neutralize it. Once I plugged this in, the room smelled much more pleasant within an hour. Even when the dogs come in wet, it makes a noticeable difference. Now, let’s see how long it holds up. Update after a month: Unfortunately, the product is no longer as effective as before. If my laundry room were larger, I would consider a bigger model like the one we use for the whole house. For now, I might need to invest in face masks.
These are perfect for my chemo treatments! They’re incredibly soft around the eyes, and the Velcro design ensures maximum light-blocking so I can get a restful sleep. I’m so grateful to have discovered them, thanks to a friend’s recommendation. If you're looking for comfort and quality sleep, I highly recommend them!
These 24” wind chimes are music to my ears! I love the peaceful sound they make. I recently moved them closer to my bedroom, and their tones remind me of Christmas music. They add such a lovely atmosphere to my porch. I would definitely buy them again!
Unfortunately, this didn’t meet my expectations. It didn’t smooth my feet at all, and the motor sounds pretty cheap. I’m in the process of returning it.
This product provides a fantastic stretch, and I use it daily on my office chair. Since I started using it, my lower back pain has disappeared by the end of the day. Highly effective!
We’re big fans of both this flavor and the coconut one. The only downside is the price, but they’re worth it.
I primarily use this form of curcumin for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, offering neuroprotection. That said, it also works wonderfully as an anti-inflammatory.
These are excellent! They’re the best ones I’ve found so far.
This was a huge disappointment. It doesn’t even work properly. It was the biggest waste of money.
I’m so impressed with this dryer! The stand and wheels make it easy to move around, and it dries the hair upwards, which speeds up the drying process. It was simple to assemble and works like a professional-grade dryer.
This nail file is fantastic! The “sand” doesn’t rub off, and it’s of great quality.
I bought this to combat dry mouth during the night, and it works wonders. I’ve just ordered three more bottles!
I’ve only been using this for about four days, but I can already tell a noticeable difference. Thank you for this great product!
This product is nice, but it’s overpriced. I found it at a big-box store for half the price.
After reading all these reviews, they all seem to be from the same person... Weird, right? Just be cautious when purchasing.
I can’t seem to get the protector off the brush, so I’ll have to return it.
I loved these gloves the first time I bought them, but the second batch felt different. The material is more felted, and the color isn’t the same. It seems like the product may have changed.
These bars are great! They’re a little chewy and can get hard if stored in a cold place, but overall they’re one of the best egg-free paleo options available. Definitely worth trying.
My posture has greatly improved, and I get compliments from physical therapists. However, I started to feel irritation around my collarbone due to a new car seat back. This posture corrector has helped hold my shoulders back, easing the discomfort. It's easy to put on, adjustable, and comfortable. Remember, only wear it for 30 minutes at first!
I only use these nail files. They’re the best in my opinion. Thank you for offering such a great product!
I bought these hoping they would block out my husband’s snoring, but they didn’t work as expected. However, they were perfect for my plane trip, keeping overhead lights out and helping me rest.
The strap on the back makes masks fit much better and feel more comfortable. Unfortunately, the little cup insert didn’t work for me. It seems designed for a much smaller nose. The rest of the design works fine, though.
These are much better than the $3 box!
This flavor doesn’t taste anything like salted caramel, and it’s pretty awful. I’ve had much better tasting whey proteins. As a caramel lover, I was really let down. It's hard to drink, and I wouldn’t recommend it. There are better options out there, like Extend.
This product is heavy-duty and works really well in the kitchen, cleaning various surfaces effortlessly.
These bags are great for small to medium waste bins. The price is right, and they were delivered quickly. However, they do tear easily with heavy or sharp items.
The soap container is difficult to squeeze, so I just applied the soap directly onto the brush. It worked well for exfoliating dry skin, but the hard-to-squeeze design makes it less convenient. I bought the three-pack, so I’m sticking with it, but I wouldn’t purchase it again.
I bought these to add traction to the soles of my boots, but they didn’t stay on for long. After just one wear, they started peeling off. They were inexpensive but ended up being a waste of money.
Maca Powder is a nutritious superfood from Peru, perfect for adding to smoothies or baking. It boosts endurance and provides essential nutrients. However, it has 20 grams of carbs per serving, so keep that in mind.
We’ve been using this product during the pandemic to stay hydrated and healthy. It’s a good supplement, though I find the salty taste a bit off-putting. Diluting it with extra water makes it more tolerable, but overall, I appreciate the vitamins it provides.
I like the concept of this device, and the vibrations are soothing. Unfortunately, I have scalp pain, and the pressure from the device made it uncomfortable for me. It also didn’t stay in place on my left ear. The battery life is short, and you need to recharge it frequently. I used it only a few times before deciding to return it.
I absolutely love this! The freshness and coconut scent are wonderful.
If you're a fan of Sangre de Grado, this is a solid choice.
These supplements were a great deal, cheaper than my regular store. I will definitely order again, though I’ll warn you, amino acids taste awful and leave you with bad breath.
These high heel pads were amazing for my feet. I wore heels I couldn’t handle before for an entire night, and they felt comfortable throughout.
These are the best nail files and buffers I’ve used. As a nail tech, I rely on them. I can clean them after use, and they last. A must-have in my toolkit.
While not the most durable, this did the job for local use. However, it’s not ideal for mailing items. It works for gift-giving, but I wouldn’t trust it for shipping.
I’ve been looking for something to ease the pain from my bunion, and this product works okay. It cushions the space between my big toe and second toe but doesn’t really correct the issue. It’s a temporary solution, but I’m still looking for something more effective.
These probiotics are reasonably priced and seem to work as well as my usual brand. They’re a good value.
Since I started taking this, the pain in my limbs has decreased significantly. I’m finally able to walk again without discomfort.
I’m impressed with this foot stool. It’s made of sturdy plastic, and it helps with bowel movements. It works best for those under six feet tall. My partner, who is 6’1”, found it uncomfortable, but it’s perfect for me. It definitely improves the bathroom experience.
I used this twice on wet feet, and it worked wonderfully at removing dead skin and smoothing the soles.
This is absolutely delicious!
It doesn’t fully straighten my curly hair, but it’s still decent.
I rely on these for joint pain. After consistent use, they’ve made a huge difference, and I’m no longer in constant knee pain. I highly recommend them.
This sensory bath toy is perfect for my autistic son. He loves the texture and enjoys holding it. It’s flexible and works well for calming sensory needs.
Fresh Aid Toothpaste has a unique formula with ginger root extract. It leaves your mouth feeling clean, though I’m not sure it’ll protect my gums as well as fluoride toothpaste. I’ve only been using it for a week, but it’s a good option for those avoiding chemicals. I’ll update if anything changes.
This product is really easy to use and does a great job of making my granite countertops shine. It leaves a pleasant, clean scent and is simple to apply—just spray and wipe with a dry cloth. The can lasts for a long time, which makes it an excellent value.
Unfortunately, just like the other reviews I ignored, the liquid won’t pass through the tube. It just doesn’t work as expected.
This modern scale is really nice and works well in my bathroom. It runs on 4 AAA batteries, which were easy to install. The glass surface looks sleek, and the scale is accurate when weighing. Overall, I’m very satisfied with it. It has met all my expectations, and I received this scale for free to test and review. This is my honest opinion after using it myself.
My family has issues with ear wax build-up, so I tried this product to make the process a bit less intimidating. It works okay, though I think I need to use it more to get the full benefit. The bottle does work as advertised, though.
These brushes seem to put more strain on my Oral B than the original brushes did. I think I’ll go back to using the original Oral B brushes for better performance.
I’ve been using the Aria scale for about a month, and it’s been great! It takes a new measurement each time I step on, which is a feature I love compared to my old scales that only showed slight changes. The sync with my Fitbit account is seamless, and I’ve had no issues with the weak WiFi in my bathroom. Body fat percentage can fluctuate, but it’s reliable enough to show trends over time if you weigh yourself consistently. Setting it up was simple, and it has become a part of my daily routine. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase!
I’ve been using it for a while, and it has a nice flavor. It’s very effective, and I’m happy with the results.
This was a gift, and the recipient loved it. It’s comfortable and was appreciated, especially for a patient.
I gave this as a gift, and it was well-received. The recipient really liked it!
I strongly advise against using Magic Erasers! They don’t serve a useful purpose and can damage any surface they come into contact with. If you care about the condition of your surfaces, stay away from these.
These adult diapers are soft and comfortable, and they provide great absorbency. My only concern is that the design looks more like baby diapers, which is a bit odd for adult products.
This item is not as pictured, which was a bit disappointing.
These colorful holiday gift bags and tags are perfect for giving smaller gifts, like homemade baked goods or bottles of wine, to neighbors. The drawstring made of ribbon seals the bags securely. They’re also great for teacher gifts or family presents. I highly recommend them!
This fits perfectly and works just as expected.
I love this pillbox with the Fox Hunt theme. It’s cute and functional!
In the clouds! God bless! 🙂
I had to return it. It didn’t work for me, unfortunately.
I’ve tried many different types of nose pads, but these self-adhesive soft pads are the best by far. They’re incredibly comfortable, especially for my small nose bridge. They come in various colors, and I think they’re worth the extra cost!
These bags work really well for clearing odors in enclosed spaces. I’m pleased with how they perform.
I’m not trying to be negative, but this was the worst $9 I’ve spent. I wouldn’t recommend it.
I’ve bought several of these kits, but I’ve figured out why they didn’t work for me. Many of the breakfasts and lunches consist of sugary bars that leave me feeling hungry afterward. I ended up switching to eggs on the days I was supposed to have the bars. I didn’t lose any weight, and I found the sugar content didn’t suit me.
This was a last-minute gift for a 15-year-old hockey fan. It arrived on time, and he seemed happy with it. I can’t comment on the game, as we didn’t play it.
While it doesn’t provide a new neck, this product does help alleviate strain and tension around my neck and shoulders. Lying on it regularly helps ease the tension, especially while relaxing or listening to music. It works best when you just relax into it.
I bought this as part of a soap-making kit, and it was well-received. A little goes a long way, so this is great value! After using it regularly for 6 months, I had to reorder. It creates fantastic lather and has been a great addition to my soap-making supplies.
Exactly what I expected. Thanks!
This pump is really strong, and I have two of them—one from here and one from another vendor. It moves more coolant than I thought it would. I’ve got it maxed out right now, but I’ll lower the setting as I don’t need that much flow. I’ve set up redundancy with two pumps using the Koolance RP-452X2 Dual 5.25” Reservoir. It’s a reliable setup.
Unfortunately, this didn’t remove the odor as I hoped it would.
I use between 12 and 14 tsp for leg cramps, and it works wonders! My dad had hand cramps, and after just 12 tsp, the cramps were gone in about 15 minutes. It’s great that I can adjust the dose based on needs. Highly recommend checking out Dr. Carolyn Dean for more info!
I loved the variety in this set. Very pleased with the selection!
I recommend using vinegar for weeds instead of chemicals! As a cancer survivor, I avoid poison and prefer vinegar with a little dish soap. It works great when used on small weeds and is safe and simple.
This is the best natural 0-calorie sweetener I’ve found! It has no aftertaste and tastes just like regular sugar. It works well for baking, though I prefer to add it toward the end of cooking. Perfect for sweetening dry cereal!
I’m excited to use these with our cloth diapers. They’re durable and waterproof! After using them for almost a year, I’m still really impressed with the quality. The drawstrings aren’t essential but still useful. These have been amazing!
The size is perfect. It does leave some residue on my hands after handling, though.
Unfortunately, this product didn’t work at all. I wouldn’t recommend wasting your money on it.
This case is great! You won’t be disappointed with this purchase.
These mats are very easy to use. They fit together and separate without any trouble. The thickness is just right—my pins don’t poke through. Plus, they dry really quickly. Overall, I’m really impressed with these mats.
I’ve tried several keto supplements, and this one was awful. The taste was so bad I couldn’t finish it. It didn’t give me the same energy boost as other supplements, and I was disappointed with the overall experience.
I’m absolutely thrilled with this product! My feet tend to develop thick calluses, and I’ve tried many methods to remove them. This device worked better than anything else—my feet are smooth and soft after just a few uses. Surprisingly, it’s gentle on the skin compared to other tools, which often left me sore. I’ll definitely continue using it.
This worked really well for me. I only needed one application to remove the odor from my old, stinky sneakers. I’ll definitely buy it again.
After trying many metal nail files, these are the only ones I use now. They’re by far the best.
I love this foot massager! It really helps with the tightness and pain from an old injury. The pressure is great, and I can adjust it based on my needs. I use it daily with no issues.
This product is pretty useless. You have to place your entire mouth over the opening and exhale, which makes it impossible to use while driving or doing anything else.
I really dislike when protein powders are overly sweetened with artificial sweeteners, but this one isn’t like that. It has a natural sweetness and tastes just like a creamy latte. I add it to my morning coffee, and it’s perfect! The only downside is the packaging—it doesn’t seal very well, so I had to transfer it to a different container to keep it fresh.
These are heavy-duty and the caps fit tightly, but I wish they were a bit larger.
This tiny pill is very easy to swallow and is great for people with dietary restrictions, like those with celiac disease or sensitivities to dairy or soy. It’s also chewable, which is a nice bonus.
DMSO is a carrier product that should be applied on clean, undamaged skin. Use with caution and only externally. When combined with pain medicine like Icy Hot, it can provide relief for severe pain. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before using.
This was the best deal I found. I’ll definitely buy again.
I had trouble warming the clay model in my small microwave. It didn’t heat evenly, and once warm, it was uncomfortable to wear because the weight was at the bottom. The Velcro strip didn’t seem secure, either. Based on the reviews, I expected better quality.
This product has given me a lot of relief for my back and legs. I no longer have to deal with my legs falling asleep!
I’ve recommended this product to many clients, and it works well for them. Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked as well for me, which is frustrating. I may try it a bit longer before deciding.
Slow results, and the chemicals are pretty strong.
I've been using this daily for a couple of months now, and I’ve definitely noticed a significant reduction in lower leg cramps, especially in my calves. This is the only supplement I’ve found that offers 1000mg of potassium per scoop, whereas others require you to take multiple pills to reach a similar dosage. I mix it into warm water (about 1/4 cup) and then add flavored water to improve the taste. It’s a little different in flavor, but you get used to it.
Tastes great, but about 20-30 minutes later, I get some unpleasant belching. I’m not sure if they are working, but I’m still taking them.
I take this for better sleep and regular bowel movements, along with Dulcolax when necessary. Since I have diabetes, my digestion has slowed, but this really helps my heart and digestion. Magnesium is awesome for muscle cramps too.
Does it work? Not sure. Did I feel a slight placebo effect? Maybe. Would I buy it again? Probably not. That’s all I have to say.
This is the only cleaning solution I’ll ever use.
These are great for my contacts! My eyes always feel refreshed in the morning after using them.
Works very well and is super easy to use.
Good product, but the extended button causes it to pop open in my pocket often. Still, it works.
I bought this to catch stray hairs missed after multiple rounds of laser hair removal. It does require multiple passes in some areas. It does pull a little, but I’m not sure if this is the norm for epilators or if this one is weaker. The electric razor option is nice for areas I can’t get. I’ve also used the heel sander on my feet, and it's fine, but that wasn’t my main reason for buying it.
I absolutely love my little witch! She’s perfect!
So grateful they make a liquid version of astaxanthin! My husband can’t swallow pills, and this is the only liquid option I’ve found. It’s a bit pricey, but it’s the only option, so we keep buying it. I mix it with his liquid fish oil, and he drinks it with juice every morning. I’m glad he doesn't mind the taste.
I love the portability of this pill organizer! It’s great for doses twice a day, but the only downside is that the pill cases are a little tricky to remove. It’s also missing AM/PM labels, only showing sun and moon icons. Overall, it’s really convenient, but these small drawbacks keep me from giving it a perfect rating.
I’m very happy with this! I spent a lot of money on a teak bench years ago, and it eventually rotted. This is lightweight, comfortable, and perfect for my small shower. If you’re frail or afraid of falls, you might want something sturdier, but for me, it’s exactly what I needed.
I bought two in different colors. One holds a nebulizer and all its parts, and the other holds personal medical equipment. It’s much more organized now, and the different colors help separate things for easy access.
If you're looking for an excellent maintenance wash with nano ceramic protection, this is the product. It has great cleaning power and leaves the paint glossy. Just follow the instructions carefully, as it needs to be rinsed off quickly. I love it, and it’s concentrated enough to use as a detailer too.
Excellent product. I’ll never be without it. It works!
This is a wonderful set for yourself or as a gift. The scents are amazing, and it’s so relaxing to soak in a hot tub. The packaging was also impressive. I’ll definitely order more for gifts in the future.
My granddaughter loves it!
Didn’t help or feel comfortable at all.
I’ve been using these for squats in my 5x5 Stronglifts program. I started feeling some instability in my knees when squatting heavy. These sleeves provide just the right amount of compression and support. Now I’m squatting heavier without issues, and they’re comfortable to wear. The size chart worked great for me too.
It shaves well, but the first one I bought stopped working after five months. The seller kindly provided a replacement.
Works as expected.
Exactly what I was looking for, and the price is great. This was much cheaper than in the store.
The product feels cheaply made.
Perfect! I bought these based on a recommendation from Kelly Starrett's book, "Ready to Run." They’re exactly what I needed—well-made and sturdy.
With the current health situation, these are great for slipping inside paper masks. They add an extra layer of protection. Occasionally, they can be a bit sticky on the edges, but they’re effective and comfortable.
The scent of this deodorant is great, but it didn’t work well for my skin. I had regular breakouts in my underarms, and I don’t typically have sensitive skin.
These masks are just as effective as standard N95 masks and are comfortable to wear. They fold neatly and last about a week each. The ear straps are comfortable, though they can get a little sharp at the back of my ears.
QGel is made in the USA, but it contains gelatin, which isn't vegan or vegetarian. It has CoQ10 and vitamin E, both of which work together as powerful antioxidants. I take this supplement for general health maintenance, and it seems to help with energy production and heart health. It’s a solid supplement if you’re looking to improve your overall well-being.
This body wash smells amazing, and the foam gives it a luxurious feel.
All the ingredients in this product are carefully selected and researched. It helps me stay focused and reduces stress. It’s a bit pricey, but it’s worth it during stressful times. One capsule works well for me since I don’t weigh much over 100 pounds.
This is a must-have for helping with COPD.
I love this product, and I’m so glad it’s available on Amazon!
I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong, but when I use this, it stays in place with no effort on my part. Unfortunately, it just didn’t work for me.
Good product.
These necklaces are pretty, and they come in a nice box, which makes them a great deal. I had to replace the chains with sturdier ones to avoid tangling.
This vitamin product works great, and I would definitely buy it again.
The size is nice, and the noise level is okay, but unfortunately, it doesn’t work very well. A waste of money.
Colloidal and nano particle minerals are fascinating. If used properly, they can deliver excellent results. Make sure to read up on them, especially copper, if you have medical issues. Many knowledgeable experts and doctors provide great information about them.
My nose used to get really sore during allergy season, but now it doesn’t at all.
I’ve used this product for years, but now it’s in capsule form instead of the old green pill. The capsules don’t seem as effective for me, and I wonder if the ingredients have changed.
I’ve been on vitamin D for years due to a deficiency. I tried this product, and it seems to work, but I can’t tell for sure. I noticed some insomnia after taking it later in the day, so I stopped that routine. Overall, it feels effective, but I’ll update if anything changes.
Exactly what I wanted!
The small buckle that sits in your ear when you sleep on your side is a bit uncomfortable.
These are great for overnight wear, but the thigh band tends to roll down during the night, which can be uncomfortable.
It’s impossible to use. The area for the battery is blocked, making it very difficult to remove. A waste of money.
This is like protein isolates taken to the next level—extra healthy and extra protein for muscle fuel. Plus, it supports joints and soft tissue. Tastes great too. I hope this review is helpful!
The packaging of this MCT oil is fancy, and it comes in a wine bottle-like container. The taste is slightly coconut-flavored, unlike other MCT oils that are flavorless. However, you’re mostly paying for the fancy presentation, not the quality. The bottle does have a tendency to drip when pouring, but otherwise, it’s fine.
These earplugs fit perfectly and allowed me to get the best sleep ever without my husband's loud snoring. I haven’t used the other earplugs in the set, but I’m sure they’re just as great! Thumbs up!
I had to buy a rubber insert or gasket because it didn’t fit any of my scooter posts, no matter how tight I made it. I tried it with two different brands of scooters, and both didn’t fit without the extra gasket I bought at a local hardware store. Without it, the basket wobbled and eventually slid down the scooter. That said, I do love it! It's great for carrying my cell phone, purse, TV remote, and other small items!
This is a very strong massage tool. While it doesn’t replace a professional massage, it does exactly what it promises: it kneads your muscles effectively.
I couldn’t wait to try this oil on my face and body. After just one use, my skin felt smooth again, and the itching stopped. I added a dropper to my bath, which made for a heavenly shower experience. I also added it to my shampoo, and for the first time in a while, my scalp didn’t itch. It didn’t completely get rid of my eczema, but it definitely soothed the itching. This oil is truly a lifesaver!
I don’t have a beard, so I found this painful to use. When I tried to shave my neck, it pulled my hair out instead of cutting it.
THIS IS NOT A LIFESAVING TOURNIQUET. It shouldn’t be used in actual trauma situations. The materials and construction are subpar, and parts of it started breaking right away. While it looks like a real tourniquet, it doesn’t function at the same level. It is, however, an affordable option for training purposes. I used it in a class, and it worked well enough for practice, but it's not suitable for real-life use. This is strictly for training.
I will definitely buy these again and again.
These gauze packs are non-sterile and a bit thin, but at this price, they’re a great option for emergency backup use (e.g., in bug-out bags). I wouldn’t rely on them in my primary first aid kit, but they’re perfect for keeping in a pinch.
I typically drive 10-15 hours a day for work and bought this cushion to relieve the discomfort I was experiencing. Unfortunately, it didn’t help and actually made things worse, increasing my discomfort to pain. Before using the cushion, I took 5-minute stretch breaks every few hours, but with the cushion, I had to take breaks every hour. I’m very disappointed and would give negative stars if I could. The company wouldn’t refund me, so now I’m stuck with this overpriced, ineffective cushion.
I wash a lot of dishes by hand, and these gloves fit my small hands perfectly. They’re not tight, but not loose either, and they don’t rip easily. I’ve had no holes even after multiple uses, which is a big deal for rubber gloves, especially when washing sharp items like knives and forks. I have several pairs for different rooms—definitely durable and long-lasting!
The grapefruit scent doesn’t match the description at all. It smells more like a generic cleaner than anything fruity.
The cutting head broke where the hinge meets the base, which was very disappointing.
I’ve been struggling with fatigue, especially since I’m older and tend to feel sleepy after sitting for a while. After taking these drops for just three days, I’ve noticed a huge difference. No more excessive yawning or sleepiness! The raspberry flavor is a bit sweet, but it works and keeps me energized for hours.
It was super easy to apply and seal my new granite vanity top. The instructions were clear, and the process was straightforward.
I’m not really sure how to review a probiotic, but after being on antibiotics, my digestive system was a mess. These helped me get back to a more regular schedule. They seemed to work just fine.
AMAZING product! I absolutely love it. Thank you!
I cannot begin to describe the amount of pain I’m in after using this device. I’ve read great reviews, but for me, it was unbearable. I can barely sit or stand after using it.
By far the best supplement I’ve ever used. Whether vegan or not, it provides incredible energy, curbs my appetite, and just makes me feel great. It even tastes amazing!
It was great! Very easy to use, and it was quite comfortable.
These washcloths are fantastic. Whenever my aide isn’t available to give me a shower, I use them. They have a pleasant scent, and they warm up nicely in the microwave.
At first, I was skeptical, but after seeing YouTube videos and trying it myself, I was amazed by how well this product cleaned our vinyl siding and decking. Our UPS driver was even impressed and took a photo! The sprayer reached high areas, so no need for a ladder. I’ll definitely be using this annually from now on!
A good product overall.
This product is decent. The steam is nice, but I was hoping for more straightening power. I may be more accustomed to flat irons. Still, it does what it’s supposed to, so it might just be a matter of personal preference.
My husband has been using this for back and leg pain. We’ve read that it can take weeks or even months for significant relief, but he’s already feeling some improvement. The instructions are easy to follow, and we’re hopeful that continued use will bring even better results.
The description said it was 4 pairs, but I only received 4 pieces (which equals 2 pairs). I felt cheated and ended up returning it. I found another seller who offered 4 pairs at a similar price.
It's just okay. The can is small, and I don’t really have strong feelings about it.
I love what EvridWear has done with these poufs! They offer 3 different levels of exfoliation: white (light), blue (moderate), and dark blue (heavy). The poufs are durable, produce a great lather, and never irritate my sensitive skin. I love the variety and appreciate the quality. They even come with a storage bag, and the price is fantastic. I highly recommend them!
I like this product, but the pump is a bit slow. I have a neck and spine injury, and I feel like it offers some support when inflated.
The flavor is weak, and there's no color to indicate what flavor you're having. I wouldn’t recommend it.
These are basically just candy with a small amount of elderberry and vitamin C. The elderberry dosage is quite low, and they are coated in sugar. They taste good, but if you want a more potent elderberry supplement, I’d suggest looking for something else.
It smells so clean, but not overpowering. I will definitely be buying more of this.
It fit perfectly into the Waterpik base, but there was a slow drip where the hose connects to the handle after use. It seems like a common issue based on reviews.
Great purchase! I would recommend this seller anytime. Thanks!
This product exceeded my expectations! After 20 minutes of use, my calluses were gone. I no longer waste money on pedicures, as this product works much better. It's easy to use and very effective.
I needed a small travel jewelry case, and this one works perfectly. It fits my vacation essentials, and I love the quilted zipper case. Great value for the price.
This is a great way to boost your immunity! I add it to my food for both health benefits and flavor. While I typically prefer fresh ingredients, this is a great alternative when I can’t find certain mushrooms locally.
This sandalwood oil has a classic woody fragrance with powdery and incense undertones. It's one of those scents you either love or hate, but it works wonderfully in homemade soaps, especially for men.
I’ll be recommending this product to my friends and family.
It worked well to keep my jewelry organized while traveling.
Very pleased with this purchase. It seems to be the real deal. I’ve used it in the past, and although there was a small mix-up with my order, they handled it well. I’d definitely buy from this seller again.
This is the best beard trimmer I’ve ever owned! It has long battery life and is easy to adjust to control the trimmer depth.
The selfie stick is easy to use and comfortable to hold. The Bluetooth remote makes taking selfies much easier than setting a timer. It extends to a good length, and the tripod is a nice bonus!
I loved this product at first. It was easy to install and adjust, and it worked great for driving with my disability. However, after two months, the glue holding the base in place came loose, which could be dangerous. I’m hesitant to buy another one for the same issue, but for now, I’ll try to fix it myself.
The container is stiff and pretty, and it fits in the car cup holder. However, there’s no lid, so after use, it’s just a tall cylinder with a hole on top. The tissue is softer than hotel tissues but rougher than Kleenex. It's small and hard to pull out just one at a time, making it frustrating to use. It’s overpriced for what you get.
At first, I loved this mask insert because it made breathing easier. However, it started to feel uncomfortable after a while, as it pressed against my nose. The shield wouldn't stay inside the mask, so I had to keep track of two pieces. It did help with cleanliness and prevented lipstick stains, but I constantly had to adjust it.
This product isn’t waterproof, but I use it in the shower all the time, and it still works great! My acne has decreased significantly since I started using it. I absolutely love it, and the price is fantastic!
Quitting smoking is tough, but this system offers a combination of rewards and therapy. The sensor helps track your progress, and there's a community to share your journey. It’s a great way to get help, and it’s okay to ask for support.
It does the job as expected.
It’s antifungal and works well for relieving itching and crawling sensations.
A bit big and bulky for smaller people, but it’s sturdy and cushioned.
This set of stones is one of the nicest I’ve used. The stones are well-polished and glide smoothly over the skin. They’re great for relaxation, though don’t expect them to reduce wrinkles. They do help with puffiness, though. The set comes nicely packaged, making it a thoughtful gift.
Unfortunately, this product did not provide any noticeable results for me.
The sponge heads detached almost immediately. The adhesion to the plastic is not strong at all. I ended up using five sponge heads when I would usually only need one.
This toner works wonders for my skin! Initially, I didn’t realize I was purchasing a toner instead of a facial wash (my mistake), but I’m still happy with the results. It leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, and glowing, and I had no breakouts after use. Plus, the seller sent me a sample of their Collagen Wash Gel, which also impressed me. I will definitely be purchasing that too. Five stars all the way! Thank you!
These Dalek socks are a big hit! I bought them for my daughter, who's a huge Doctor Who fan, and she was so excited. They come in vibrant blue and orange, with one pair in a neutral grey, perfect for various outfits. They fit comfortably just above the heel, and she loves both the fit and design. Any Doctor Who fan will appreciate these!
My husband loves these socks! They are thick, stretchy, and non-binding, making them incredibly comfortable. They stay up without leaving any marks on his calves.
This chain was a great replacement for my broken one. It’s definitely a good value for the price.
We’ve been babysitting a mature cat, and this air deodorizer has been a lifesaver. It helps eliminate odors, especially in a small space. I can immediately tell if someone forgets to plug it in—it’s that effective. It’s almost silent, but you can feel the air circulating. It keeps the room smelling fresh and clean, helping with odors from things like mold, septic gases, or even sneezes. It’s a great option for smaller spaces!
This baby oil has a gentle, classic scent that I adore. Although I don’t typically use baby oil on my skin, it’s great for insect repellent, removing sticky substances like gum or stickers, and even cleaning paint off brushes. It’s also essential in making dough and slime, which my kids and I enjoy playing with. A handy product to have around!
This product is amazing! I use it mainly on my neck and shoulders, and it works wonders. It’s also helpful for relieving period pain when I wrap it around my waist. I don’t know what I was doing without it!
This bag is cute and functional, but it’s not very strong and barely zips up. I’ll only be using it occasionally. It’s a good deal for the price, and the jars were exactly as described. Delivery was fast.
Unfortunately, I didn't like the taste of this product—it was too bitter for me.
I've been using Heel Tastic for over three years, and it keeps my heels and toes from cracking. However, I mistakenly ordered a different product once, and it was ineffective. Make sure you’re getting the original Heel Tastic for the best results.
The parts of this product fit together well, but the squeegee is flimsy and too narrow. It almost touches the metal if too much pressure is applied, so it doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. Although it’s not worth returning, I wouldn't purchase it again.
If you’re looking for a reliable fish oil brand, Carlon has been in the business long before it became a trend.
This is by far the easiest opener I’ve ever used. It requires much less hand strength compared to other similar products.
I returned this product.
This product has been a game-changer for me! I've carried tension in my neck and shoulders for years, and since I injured my neck three years ago, I’ve been dealing with chronic neck pain. After using this device for just two days, I felt significant relief. I now use it every night for 10-15 minutes before bed, and my neck feels much more relaxed and mobile.
These are inexpensive but still offer decent value for the price. You get exactly what you expect.
These products are of great quality, and I loved every scent in the box. Highly recommend them!
These taste amazing and make us feel fantastic! You can definitely feel the difference.
These clippers are great at clipping nails efficiently without leaving jagged edges. I still need to smooth them out a bit, but I do that with all my clippers. They come in a convenient tin for storage.
Once I figured out how to remove the center shaving head, this product became a 5-star item for me.
I use month-long disposable contacts and always clean them carefully. This product, along with regular multipurpose solutions, helps extend the life of my lenses by at least a week.
Unfortunately, these didn’t help me find pet urine. It might be due to my color blindness, but my UV lamp worked much better.
These have been lifesavers for my feet!
My wife loves the color and fit of these—they stay in place comfortably.
This scale works well, but I recommend checking the starting point before using it to ensure it reads 0. It’s a decent option for a budget scale.
It’s alright, nothing extraordinary.
I wish I had discovered this product sooner! I’ve been supplementing with flaxseed oil for my rosacea and using Ecological Formula’s TriSalts daily. This has significantly relieved my nerve pain from blood clots in my leg and foot—instant results. It’s been a real game-changer, and I can live much better now!
This fish oil has a pleasant taste, making it easy to take.
I can’t sleep without these eye pads! They’re the most comfortable I’ve ever worn and are adjustable to fit perfectly.
As expected, this tastes great.
This product has been incredibly helpful. My husband refuses to get a hearing aid, but this has allowed us to stop shouting. It’s made a significant difference in our communication.
These bags are heavy-duty, with crisp folds and a reinforced bottom. However, the handles are a bit tricky to attach. You’ll need to push the plastic tips through both holes, but they hold up well even with heavy items. Still, I was confused as to why they aren’t pre-attached.
The bristles aren’t sturdy enough for brushing teeth, and the bamboo handle feels like it might give me a splinter. A waste of money for me.
These are the best, but they’re overpriced on Amazon compared to the price at Whole Foods, where they cost a third of the price here!
I’m really enjoying the bottles I received and will likely order more soon.
I’ve been using this for years, and it’s the only product that prevents tooth sensitivity when I switch to something else.
This product cleans very well without leaving a sticky residue. The rose scent is lovely—not too strong. The company also provided helpful instructions on how to use the spray. I will definitely repurchase and recommend it.
This product is great around the house!
I will definitely be buying these again!
I had high hopes, but I’m unimpressed with this product. I get better results with a dollar store antibiotic ointment.
My husband likes these—they fit well and are more comfortable than other options.
I didn’t like this at all. It tasted like cardboard and I will never order it again.
This product broke at the seam on the first use. The “heavy-duty” velcro also cracked. It didn’t hold up well, especially for the price I paid. Stick with simpler harnesses for better durability.
This product helps restore your pH levels and supports gut and urinary health. It also helps balance vaginal health and prevent infections. I recommend it for maintaining overall intimate wellness.
When I opened my container, I was shocked to find it was less than full. The powder is fine and has a sweet but slightly bitter aroma. The taste is mild in my coffee. I’ve been taking Lions Mane capsules for months but decided to try this powder for quicker absorption. I’ll update my review once I feel the effects of the powder.
This product does a great job cleaning floors and is very easy to use.
I love this kit! It comes with a variety of file textures, works great on both bare nails and acrylics, and looks nice too. I’m really impressed with the quality and highly recommend it.
I love my bags now—they make it so much easier to tie up my garbage!
These work effectively to prevent mask straps from irritating your ears.
I tried it once, but it didn't seem to make a noticeable difference.
The size is perfect for packing a comprehensive home medical kit. It's surprisingly spacious once you fill it up, holding items like medications, bandages, and gloves. Ideal for travel, it keeps everything organized in a portable way. Even though it seems small initially, it holds quite a bit, and the price is reasonable. Highly recommend!
Kinesio tape is excellent for a variety of physical issues. I've tried other brands, but the Kinesio Tex Gold is by far the most effective. It adheres well and stays in place for days, even during activities like swimming or sweating. It's easy to remove with minimal residue. I suggest consulting with a physical therapist before using it on your own.
The band is really impressive! The material feels like high-quality leather—strong and durable. It comes in three colors: Brown, Black, and Light Brown, all neatly packaged. Great value and a wonderful product overall.
These are good for soap-making, but cutting them with a serrated knife is tricky. It was difficult to cut through the loofah sponge.
This is my favorite toothpaste.
This part worked perfectly for fixing my stem. It repaired the broken screw as good as new.
Bought this for a large 36" tub, and it works perfectly.
I didn't enjoy this at all. It had no flavor, and the only taste left was bitter and unpleasant. Not worth the price. Ended up returning it.
My grandkids loved these probiotics! I tried one and it had a sweet fruit punch flavor, almost like a pixie stick, very enjoyable.
This product worked well for my hair. It seemed to be of good quality, and my hair looked nice after using it. It was also durable, easy to hold, and use. I was satisfied and would recommend it.
Very moisturizing and protective with almost no scent—perfect for my preferences. Will buy again when needed.
When I first got this, I was surprised by its clear appearance, unlike other similar products. It's flavorless and odorless. After using it daily, I noticed some improvements in energy and sleep, especially during this tough, cold winter. I’m doing better than usual, so I consider this product effective.
I bought this cushion directly from the manufacturer, but it doesn’t seem worth the price. It slides around on my chair, and I end up readjusting often. After using it for weeks, I still find it uncomfortable. Definitely not the best cushion for $60.
I saw noticeable results in just about a week.
These work well for displaying Christmas cards, and they can be used both vertically and horizontally.
The cap leaks, and the taste is unpleasant. I'm not sure it meets expectations.
I couldn't tolerate this product for some reason, and it didn't agree with me.
The plates and napkins are of high quality—thick and durable. The kids enjoyed using them at our small party. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
This straightener worked great for my 5-year-old's hair. It’s gentle enough to avoid damage but effective for smoothing, especially when combined with a lice comb. Not recommended as a main straightener, but it works well after styling.
This fragrance is perfect for my kitchen. It lasts long and doesn’t clog the diffuser.
The front fastening on this wrap can be uncomfortable, especially with the velcro. However, the back fastening works fine and provides comfort. It's soft and seems to be of good quality.
This cleaner doesn't foam much, but it worked well on my carpets. I appreciate that it’s free of harsh chemicals and cleans effectively.
The tire broke during installation, and customer service was unhelpful, offering only a partial refund and requiring me to return it at my own expense. Very disappointing experience.
I've been using this for almost two weeks now, and I love it. The individual wrapping is convenient, and I’ll continue using them!
I took two pills in one day and didn’t feel any boost. I’ll keep taking them, but I hope it starts to show results over time.
Good protection.
The lid broke within a week, and it disconnected entirely soon after. I didn't reach out to the seller but expected better quality.
Good product, works as intended.
I've noticed slight improvement in my joints with this supplement.
I haven’t used these yet, but I’m already impressed by their appearance. Bought them for my mother-in-law as a gift. They're larger than expected, durable, and aesthetically pleasing. I think she’ll love them! I’ll update after she uses them.
This is an excellent pre-and-post-workout mix. While it contains aspartame, I prefer avoiding extra sugar. It’s high in electrolytes and protein, making it perfect for my intense Florida workouts. I was a Gatorade fan, but now I prefer this. I’ll keep buying more.
These work great! I’m allergic to most dryer sheets, but these don't cause me any issues.
A very comfortable mask.
Easy to use and remove. Great for picking up pet hair.
These are okay, but they didn’t provide much warmth. Still, they’re comfortable.
I purchased the Heated Sleep Eye Mask for my wife, and she loves it! It heats up quickly, stays warm, and is very comfortable. The design blocks out light, and the material is soft and breathable. Perfect for anyone dealing with migraines, dry eyes, or just wanting a relaxing sleep. Highly recommend!
I’m still figuring out how to use this effectively. I tried it on my nose and around my mouth, but didn't see much difference. The vacuum is strong, and it has multiple suction heads. The cold compress feature feels nice, but the hot compress didn’t get warm enough to make a difference.
This sound machine has a unique feature—a human-like voice announces the timer settings, which is quite cute. The build quality is not the best, and the buttons require a firm press to work. However, the night light is bright, and the sounds like birds and thunderstorms are enjoyable. It’s functional but not amazing for the price.
I bought this shaver for my husband, but it had charging issues. The light stays on all the time, and the battery doesn’t last long enough for a full shave. The manual is confusing, and overall, it hasn’t performed well. My husband won’t be using it anymore.
As a fan of all things science, I love the beaker-inspired packaging. This toner addresses various skin concerns, including irritation and oil control. It moisturizes and is great for oily, acne-prone skin. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an all-in-one solution!
The small roller handle broke almost immediately, and the larger roller handle is too flimsy. These didn’t hold up well, so I’m returning them.
Poorly made grabber. I’ve had several others, but this one doesn’t hold up. The center folds easily, making it wobble. It’s just not sturdy enough, and I’m very disappointed.
The item arrived opened with something stuck inside. I won’t be using it—definitely a waste of money.
This D3K2 supplement is a great value. The price is reasonable for a 3-month supply, and the combination of D3, K2, and calcium is ideal for maintaining bone health. I take it daily and feel good about its benefits.
I didn’t expect much, but these earplugs worked surprisingly well. I wore them to a concert, and my ears weren’t ringing afterward. They are a bit tricky to hold onto, though, and easy to lose.
Not sharp enough for my needs.
I’ve been using Berger lamps since 1989 and love them. The scents are wonderful, and the containers are beautiful.
I bought this for my grandpa, and he loves it! It arrived fully charged, which was a nice surprise. The charging process is simple, and the additional set of blades is a great bonus. Looking forward to seeing how it holds up over time.
An excellent choice for inclusion in any first aid kit; highly recommended.
While I believe there’s some noticeable improvement, I’m not sure it’s as significant as expected. I’m continuing to use it to avoid wasting my investment, though my morning routine is already quite packed.
The display is difficult to read due to incomplete numbers. I returned the item due to this issue.
Ideal for managing Sever's disease. My son finds these very comfortable and they are helping alleviate his pain.
These sheets have exceeded our expectations. After ten years of trying different brands, these are the softest and most durable. The wrinkle-resistant feature is a bonus, and they fit our pillow-top mattress with some extra room.
Perfect size for organizing Brother Tze tapes.
These masks are comfortable to wear, thanks to the soft, slightly stretchy material. However, they lack filter pockets, nose bridge wires, and adjustable ear straps. The polka dot designs are a fun bonus!
I was surprised that Stevia was not listed as an ingredient; the product contains Maltodextrin and Silica. Despite this, the sweetness and performance meet my expectations. This could be a labeling oversight, as previous products from the same brand included full ingredient listings.
This product meets my expectations. It was easy to use straight out of the box and feels comfortable to hold.
This product is highly effective for treating stage II pressure ulcers and moisture-related skin breakdown. I wouldn’t recommend it for intact skin, but it works wonders for wound care. As a wound certified nurse, I trust this product and use it regularly.
The extended length of this shoehorn helped alleviate my mother’s back pain, which she experienced when using a shorter version. This tool is ideal for anyone with flexibility limitations or back issues.
This compact light is a game-changer! I initially blinding myself when I first used it, but now I love its size and convenience. It fits perfectly on a cluttered desk and has multiple light temperature settings, which I appreciate. The warm light is just what I needed. The timer feature is a nice touch, and I’ll definitely be ordering another one for my son.
It’s difficult to find parts for my old paint gun, but these fit perfectly and are just what I needed.
After watching reviews for a week on YouTube, I tried this product and experienced no stomach issues. It made me feel great and is especially helpful for those with HPV.
You get what you pay for. The tool arrived on time, but after inserting the batteries, it kept spinning and wouldn’t stop. I had to remove the batteries to stop it, and it never worked again after that first use.
This product performs as expected.
The product fits my Z2 travel CPAP machine perfectly. I used it in a tropical climate and found it effective in reducing dryness, although I can't speak for how it would work in drier climates.
Be cautious with this wet charcoal product as it gets everywhere. I had difficulty removing it from my teeth and gums, even after brushing and flossing. Although the results haven’t been visible yet, I’m not impressed so far.
I’ve added this supplement to my daily routine with noticeable improvements. As always, consult with your doctor before adding any new supplement. The product arrived well-sealed. I received this product at a discounted rate for testing and am sharing my honest review.
This washcloth has proven reliable over time. It’s long-lasting and holds up well after repeated washes.
Provides noticeable relief from inflammation.
The denture bath is functional, but it’s a bit too small for larger dentures.
Currently, this is the best product on the market. I recommend opting for the Pro Formula, as it performs better than the others I’ve tried.
This product is exactly as described.
These refills fit perfectly with the Scotch-Brite dish scrubber and perform much better than the name-brand options. The material quality is superior, and they don’t leak soap like the originals. I’ll definitely buy again.
This sponge is fantastic! It’s durable, feels great to the touch, and the band keeps your hand securely in place while using it.
The product is small and difficult to apply. I have calluses from crossfit, and it didn’t provide any more benefit than using coconut oil.
A great purchase overall!
These bottles are transparent, so you can easily see how much water is left. They don’t leak and retain heat well. I’m confident in their quality, and I don’t expect to need replacements soon.
These pads were helpful for improving the fit of my slightly too large flats. After trying different combinations, they fit perfectly. I’d rate it 4 stars since a little more thickness would make them even better.
This product helps alleviate upper shoulder muscle pain. It absorbs well into the skin, but you might need to apply a generous amount. The ingredients also have anti-inflammatory properties, making it a good value compared to other options.
A cute, lightweight product that fits well.
I bought these for a baby shower gift. They are of excellent quality and match the description perfectly.
This product has a pleasant scent and offers good value. The shipping was timely as well.
I love this product and highly recommend it. I’ll definitely purchase again.
After using several electric toothbrushes, I find this one very portable and convenient. It performs almost as well as my Sonicare, with the added benefit of being easy to carry around. The multiple modes and strength options make it customizable for my needs.
These hot socks have been a great solution for keeping my feet warm in air-conditioned spaces. They are especially comforting when heated in the microwave and work wonderfully for relaxing at night.
Great product at a good price, and I love the multipack. I will definitely buy it again. Once you try Scrub Mommy, you won’t go back!
As someone with chronic low Vitamin B12, I find this liquid supplement very effective. It offers a quick energy boost and tastes fine after a follow-up drink. I’ll definitely repurchase when it runs out.
This product works as expected and performs well.
This is almost the same as other products I’ve tried, so I will likely buy more.
This toothpaste is great for keeping my mouth fresh and clean. It doesn’t dry me out like some other options, and it’s made with vegan-friendly, recyclable materials. Plus, it’s produced in the USA. Great choice!
So far, it seems to work well, but I’ll need more time to assess its long-term effectiveness.
These taste awful with an overpowering oregano flavor. The cubed shape makes swallowing difficult. The product might work, but the taste was off-putting.
As advertised.
I bought this directly from the manufacturer because they offered a smaller set not available on Amazon. However, the “one-month supply” is really only a one-week supply. The treatment was messy and difficult to apply due to hard-to-open tubes. Additionally, I didn’t see any improvement after using it as instructed. Overall, I was disappointed with the product and would not purchase it again.
I didn’t experience much from this product, but my wife really enjoys it.
This leather cleaner works effectively for both shoes and bags. It’s easy to apply and provides moisture and revitalization to the leather with even, careful application.
Magnesium has been a beneficial supplement for me, helping with anxiety and digestion. This is a high-quality product, and I’m happy with my purchase.
While the product does help keep your bong cleaner, it doesn’t fully clean it. For the price, I still have to clean it manually every few days. It’s effective, but not perfect for all situations.
I've always been a fan of Sweetsation Therapy products, and this sunscreen is no different! Usually, I buy directly from their website, but this time, Amazon offered a better price. Funny how that works! I decided to try this after being disappointed by the Honest brand sunscreen from Costco, which left my kids greasy, unprotected, and sunburned. It was a disaster! Sweetsation's sunscreen, on the other hand, is excellent—light, creamy, and absorbs beautifully without any oily residue. It's effective in preventing sunburns and is gentle on sensitive skin, even for my allergy-prone daughter. Plus, it smells like chocolate, which is a fun bonus! A little goes a long way, so the price feels justified. I’ll definitely be repurchasing.
These roller balls are fantastic—compact, functional, and the colors are vibrant and beautiful. A lovely little find!
Unfortunately, this cleaner didn’t meet expectations. It leaves a noticeable film on my mat that I can’t remove without hosing it down or taking it into the shower. Not what I hoped for, and it feels like false advertising.
I love how these socks help with my dry, cracked heels—they feel great! However, I did develop a rash from the silicone lining. To work around it, I’ve been wearing them inside-out with a regular sock over them, which also makes it easier to wear shoes in the winter. Not perfect, but still helpful.
This toothpaste has a delightful clove and mint flavor that I love, and it cleans thoroughly.
I was pleasantly surprised by this product! Though I received it free to review, it quickly became a favorite. As someone with long hair past my waist, I’m cautious with heat tools, but this one works well. It straightens efficiently, especially on slightly damp hair, and leaves my hair soft and smooth. The instructions were straightforward, though the button placement is inconvenient—I kept accidentally changing the settings. Overall, a great addition to my haircare routine, and I’ll keep using it.
Sadly, this product provided no relief from my pain. It didn’t work for me at all.
These pads are versatile and fantastic! I use one pack for skincare and another for my dog’s daily grooming. They’re washable, durable, and perfect for both uses. They even make great gifts!
These q-tip swabs are a game-changer! My toddler used to hate having his ears cleaned, but now he’s eager to do it himself. I feel safe letting him try since they’re designed to prevent pushing too far.
This was the perfect gift for my 19-year-old granddaughter! She loves all things sparkly, and this hair tool is both stylish and functional. It heats up quickly, is lightweight, and includes a car adapter—so convenient! She can now do her hair on the go. A dual-voltage feature makes it great for travel too. A fantastic purchase!
I’m blown away by how well this product works! It cleaned even the dirtiest pipes effortlessly, with no lingering smells or flavors afterward. The instructions were clear, and it exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend!
I use this tool for work, measuring pull forces, and it performs as well as professional models that cost significantly more. While it isn’t calibratable, it’s accurate enough for my needs. Excellent value!
Love this product—it’s fantastic.
I’m so grateful for this swim diaper for my 4-year-old daughter with a disability. It fits perfectly, works well under any swimsuit, and allows her to continue swimming practice without issues. Thank you for creating such an inclusive and functional product!
These cobalt blue bottles are perfect for making oil blends. The quality is excellent, and I love the rich color.
This tool has great potential, but the suction cups don’t stay in place, which makes it almost unusable. Such a shame!
While the items matched the description, they didn’t work for my husband. It’s worth trying since they may work for others, but we didn’t have success.
The cloth liner didn’t last through a single house cleaning. Very disappointing.
These little containers are super cute, easy to use, and perfect for carrying pills in my bag. A great product at a great price!
This lotion is a lifesaver for my nighttime leg cramps. It works almost instantly, relaxing the muscles and allowing me to fall back asleep. It’s not greasy, has no scent, and I’ve recommended it to several people who now swear by it too. Absolutely worth the cost.
These toothbrushes are excellent for sensitive gums. The soft bristles clean effectively without irritation, and the travel cases are a thoughtful touch. Each family member gets their own color, which is a bonus. Highly recommend!
Love the fit and style of this product—it’s just what I was looking for.
Unfortunately, one of these broke after only two weeks. Hopefully, the others will last longer.
Followed the directions carefully, but it’s hard to tell if this product actually worked. I might try again, but I’m hesitant.
This toothpaste is great for cleaning and whitening without fluoride. However, I’m concerned it contains sodium benzoate.
This is a wonderful product! Easy to use, and my baby doesn’t mind it at all. Highly recommended!
Cooked two burger patties from this pack, and they were delicious with minimal shrinkage. A happy find!
These dog-themed matches are adorable, though a bit overpriced. I gave them as gifts, but no one commented on how cute they were—guess I’ll rethink my gift-giving circle!
What a charming book! It’s like having tea with a good friend—practical, helpful, and a joy to read. A lovely addition to my herb book collection.
This toilet spray does the job, but the sea salt scent wasn’t quite what I expected—it leans floral. Also, one sprayer splatters instead of misting, which is inconvenient. Despite these issues, it works as advertised.
I buy these because I appreciate that they are disposable and eco-friendly, not made from plastic or styrofoam. However, they are on the pricey side.
These keto electrolyte drops have been a great aid in helping me get back on track with weight loss. The taste isn't amazing, but it's not bad either. Mixing them into a drink works best. The bottle size is good for the price, and the mild flavor of the keto salt is a plus since stronger tastes are hard for me to handle. Overall, this is a good product and a great value.
This product works effectively, and it doesn't cause any side effects, which is a big relief. The only downside is that it’s a bit expensive, but if you need it, it’s worth it.
I was thrilled to find such a lovely product for an 80th birthday party. The items were soft, reasonably priced, and arrived quickly. I would definitely use this seller again!
I've struggled with poor posture my entire life, but this product has been transformative. Within a week of use, I’m standing straighter, and people have noticed I look healthier. The instructions are clear, and I wear it for 30-60 minutes a day while doing chores. It’s a total game changer.
These fit snugly and work well. While they don’t offer the same level of power as brand-name replacement heads, they perform admirably for the price.
The product works perfectly fine!
This tastes great and blends wonderfully into smoothies with frozen fruit, milk, and ice. While I wouldn’t recommend mixing it with just a liquid, it’s excellent in a blender. I've had my container for months, and it’s still fresh. The price is a bit high, but it lasts a long time.
This has been a lifesaver at the office—I can sit all day comfortably with it. It’s so good that I could sit on it 24/7!
Wow, this is incredibly comfortable! My back has never felt happier. Thank you!
This product almost turns tie shoes into slip-ons. Super convenient and easy to use.
My husband, who is 60, has been facing some new health challenges, including decreased testosterone levels and a slightly enlarged prostate. His doctor recommended Saw Palmetto, and this product combines it with vitamins and other natural ingredients. After using this, he sleeps through the night without needing to get up to urinate, which has been life-changing. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review, and I can confidently say it’s been a great help for him.
This is fantastic for getting precise circumference measurements for both yourself and others. The plastic end of the tape prevents it from retracting, but it could use some reinforcement since the tape becomes unusable if it breaks.
These bags are huge! I tie a knot in one corner, and they stay secure when the trash is taken out. They can be reused until they get too dirty or smelly.
I’ve been using this for years, and it always helps make my back feel better. I’m not entirely sure how it works, but it does the trick every time.
This product is excellent for relieving neck pain. Highly recommended!
The capsules are of high quality and very effective.
These small bags are ideal for portion control. They’re practical and work perfectly!
For the past few years, I’ve rarely been sick, and I believe my daily vitamin C intake plays a part. Recently, I was exposed to someone spreading their cold, and I feared I’d get sick. I used this product as directed—four times a day—and was amazed that I didn’t fall ill. It’s a bit pricey, but the results are worth it. I’ll always keep it on hand and even recommended it to my nurse practitioner.
These Ziploc gallon-sized bags are durable and feature a smooth slider closure. They hold a lot and make a fun gift with NFL-themed designs. A fantastic find for sports fans and a great value overall!
Though it's on the pricey side, the quality is exceptional. If it's within your budget, it's definitely worth the purchase.
I bought this to increase my fiber intake, hoping for better regulation. However, since it's only soluble fiber, it didn’t meet my needs. That said, the product is easy to use, dissolves completely in water after a minute or two, and is both tasteless and texture-free. While it might work for others, it wasn’t effective for my situation.
This product truly does an excellent job of clearing out impurities from your pores.
These are incredibly convenient, and the box is attractive enough to leave on a side table without any concern.
The product delivers exactly as promised. The pills are easy to swallow, and I’ve had no issues while using them.
I wasn’t a fan of this product. The caffeine content kept me awake all night after taking two pills, and the high concentration of Vitamin B12 seemed unnecessary since the body excretes the excess. Additionally, the subscription cancellation process feels deceptive, requiring extra steps to confirm cancellation. If you’re looking for an alternative, I’d recommend Alpha Brain, which is more cost-effective and caffeine-free.
These amino acids taste amazing! Since I started taking them, I’ve noticed faster recovery from workouts and less post-exercise soreness. However, the packaging could be improved—the bag is oversized, and the scoop is too short, making it messy to use. I reached out to customer service, and they assured me that smaller containers are on the way. Great product and top-notch customer support!
This product offers many health benefits, and I enjoy the taste of vinegar. My daughter initially disliked it, but after a week, she began adding it to her water and now enjoys it too. The best part is that it's all-natural!
These are an excellent replacement for my favorite running shoes.
These cloths are sturdy, quick-drying, and reusable. While they can’t handle machine washing due to their thinness, they’re perfect for eco-friendly cleaning. I use about one per week for kitchen counters, and the colors—magenta and fuchsia—are vibrant, though very similar.
These cups feel awkward. The gold rim looks cheap, and they are fragile, breaking easily. I wouldn't recommend or use them.
I used this disinfectant spray on my shoes, which had developed an unpleasant smell. It significantly reduced or eliminated the odor, depending on how frequently I applied it. It’s effective and does the job well.
Perfect! The product matches the description exactly.
I wanted a functional and aesthetically pleasing clipper set, and this delivers. Both the fingernail and toenail clippers feel solid, are ergonomic, and cut cleanly without jagged edges. They’re made of stainless steel, ensuring durability and ease of sanitation. Though they come without a case, I store them in a small makeup bag. Highly satisfied with their performance!
I know it’s a strange item to discuss, but as someone who occasionally travels with my husband in his truck, I thought this would be useful for nighttime needs. Unfortunately, it’s cumbersome, leaks, and the gasket often falls off. I wouldn’t recommend it.
Simple to prepare and tastes great!
I’ve only used this product once so far, so I’m not sure about its effectiveness yet.
This product doesn’t work well for gymnastics activities. I found that "It Stays" performs much better.
The texture of this product strikes a nice balance—not too hard from beeswax, nor too soft from olive oil. The price is reasonable compared to big-name brands, and the olive oil flavor is acceptable. However, I was disappointed that the use-by date was only two months from when I received it, so I’ll need to store unused tubes in the fridge.
This product doesn’t provide enough iron to manage anemia. Even doubling the dosage wasn’t sufficient for my needs.
These work reasonably well for general noise cancellation, like mowing the lawn or attending sporting events, but I wouldn’t rely on them for shooting protection. Over-ear options offer better hearing safety in that scenario.
I used this toothbrush for the first time yesterday, and I was pleasantly surprised. It’s lightweight, easy to handle, and reached all my back teeth comfortably. After brushing, my teeth felt exceptionally clean and even shiny! The pink color was a fun bonus.
A guilt-free snack option that works well as a light meal replacement. The taste is healthy—not overly sweet but still enjoyable.
These fiber supplements taste great and are easy to take. I don’t mind using them regularly.
Fast delivery and spot-on accuracy!
This product arrived on time and in perfect condition. It’s an excellent way to monitor acidity levels and has helped me address some health concerns. I plan to reorder and even give it as a thoughtful holiday gift.
Natural remedies usually don’t work for me, but this one seems promising. I used it alongside Sudafed for a bad cold, and within two days, I felt significantly better. Though it’s pricey, I’ve used it for months and believe it helps prevent colds from escalating.
This product didn’t have any noticeable effect for me.
These glasses are amazing for nighttime driving through canyons. They reduce glare and help alleviate anxiety from oncoming headlights. I highly recommend them, especially for truck drivers or anyone working late hours.
Exactly what I needed for cutting both my hair and my husband’s.
These detergent sheets lack clear instructions on water quantity, but they dissolve easily and clean effectively. I appreciate their eco-friendly, compact design, making them a great space-saving option.
As a first-time water flosser user, I’m thrilled with this purchase. It has a good-sized reservoir, plenty of attachments, and works great. It’s easy to charge and portable too.
These wipes are excellent for cleaning lenses. They’re simple to use and disposable. I’d buy them again.
The orange cream flavor is delightful and much better than other options I’ve tried.
A good product overall. Thank you!
This version is stronger due to its alcohol content, which I prefer since it’s more effective for my needs.
The product itself is fine and undamaged, but the packaging was poor and lacked protection. It could easily have been compromised during shipping.
I almost forgot I had this product, but I must admit it’s effective at reducing lasting odors. I keep it plugged in constantly.
This belt has been a lifesaver for relieving back pain and belly pressure, especially at such an affordable price.
These pill boxes are surprisingly small! I’ve never seen anything like them before.
I’m very pleased with these rinse-free bath cloths. They’re larger than expected, thick, and soft. With just a bit of water, they create a nice lather that dries without leaving a sticky or stiff residue. They’re perfect for travel, camping, or post-surgery recovery—so versatile and easy to use.
While the idea behind this mask insert is good, the execution falls short. It leaves gaps that let in unfiltered air, doesn’t fit well on adult faces, and tends to fall off when removing the mask. It also barely reduces fogging for glasses. Overall, it’s not worth it.
This product is okay but not great. It lacks an applicator and advises against using fingers, so a tissue is the only option. It initially burned slightly but did provide some numbing relief later. I prefer other brands for better performance.
A fantastic purchase! I’m happy with it.
The item isn’t long enough for my needs.
The scent could be more prominent—it’s too subtle for my taste.
These seem promising so far. I’ve placed them on my lawn and hope they keep gophers away as intended.
The TriNova Grill Cleaner works well. Just spray it on, let it sit for a bit, and scrub lightly. It makes cleaning much easier than using water alone.
These simple teethers are fantastic! We’ve already gone through two sets and keep one in every baby bag. A great on-the-go option for little ones.
This product is very messy to use and leaks constantly. Please take it back.
The product doesn’t dissolve as expected. I followed the online instructions since the package itself came without any directions. Unfortunately, I don’t see this being suitable as a gift.
These masks are both functional and practical. They stay conveniently around your neck when not in use, and the adjustable design ensures a snug fit without discomfort. No more ear irritation! I appreciate the quick delivery—I ordered black and white masks on Saturday, and they arrived Monday morning.
The concept of a finger brush for dogs’ teeth is great, but the bristles are too soft to be effective in cleaning.
This apple cider vinegar product seems to aid digestion, even though I don’t have significant issues. It’s a nice addition to my supplement routine, and the taste is pleasant. I’d recommend trying it for a week—you might notice a positive difference.
If you’re keen on shielding yourself from EM fields, this product might be for you. While applying it caused significant lagging on my laptop, I’ll acknowledge that it seems to work as described. Positives: it’s lightweight, odor-free, easy to shape, and peels off cleanly. Still, I’m removing it due to the performance issues on my PC.
I love this product! It tastes great, leaves no chemical aftertaste, and has kept me feeling healthy and energetic—only one illness in three years!
I’m a big fan of this brand! These tissues arrived just in time for cold season. They’re gentle on the nose, don’t dry it out, and are thick enough not to fall apart. Plus, the box design is quite appealing.
Very nice product—worth every penny.
The sponges are what you’d expect at a dollar store, but the steel wool seems durable and should last for months. The sponges might only hold up for about a month.
This mask fits perfectly over my eyelash extensions without damaging them. I’ll definitely be repurchasing!
I bought one of these organizers for each car, and they’ve been fantastic. Compact yet spacious enough for a full first aid kit and more. The dividers and pockets make it easy to keep everything organized. Highly recommended!
These gloves are a bit big for me but still manageable. They work well for both dishwashing and cleaning. The long sleeves and quality material make them a great choice.
Good fit and decent backing. While not as plush as some options, it’s still a great liner at this price.
These are absolutely perfect!
The flavor is amazing, but I wish the certification seal mentioned on the website was present on the product itself.
This urn is beautifully made, with a standout blue color that looks stunning. It’s well-constructed and has brought joy to my family in honoring our mum.
This sound machine offers 28 sounds, and while most are clear, a couple are slightly staticky. The timer and nightlight features are handy, and it’s well-priced at $23.39. The user-friendly controls are a bonus, but I’d prefer if an AC adapter were included.
Worked perfectly for my web needs.
The product works, but two buttons on each side aren’t enough. I wish it had three buttons per flap to secure better for both my toddler and newborn.
The product performs as described, but I missed the fact that it contains egg yolk, which I’m allergic to. Be sure to check the ingredients if you have allergies.
This iron is disappointing. It pours water unevenly instead of steaming properly. Even with distilled water, it doesn’t function as expected. I wouldn’t recommend this iron, even for $10.
An effortless way to get your daily fiber—no mixing required!
Fresh, clean scent and makes shower cleaning a breeze.
These mobility aids are wonderful for added support. They’re squeaky, but applying dry lubricant fixed that. Great for my peripheral neuropathy—much better than using a single cane.
These elderberry gummies are perfect for boosting immunity. They taste great, are easy for kids to chew, and helped us stay healthy through cold and flu season.
This scale is well-made, works perfectly, and looks great. It’s been an excellent tool for tracking weight as my partner and I focus on fitness goals.
The flavor wasn’t as unpleasant as I feared.
These mask extenders are essential for long-term mask use. They’re comfortable and adjustable, but might feel tight on larger heads. They worked well for me and prevented ear chafing.
These sponges clean exceptionally well without scratching, but they’re single-use and deteriorate quickly.
Unfortunately, these break after flossing just one or two teeth.
This product has good suction and thickness but may not be ideal for beginners. Overall, a solid purchase.
These drink packets are excellent for rehydration after a bike ride. They’re compact, flavorful, and not overly sweet.
Great product, thanks!
The item arrived on time, exactly as described, and was nicely packaged.
This blood pressure monitor is excellent—well-made, easy to use, and accurate. The voice prompts and dual user memory are helpful features. While it doesn’t include batteries or a charger, it’s a great product overall.
I tried this natural dental product, but it’s not for me. It lacks flavor, doesn’t leave my breath fresh, and feels crumbly while brushing.
This slim towel dispenser fits perfectly in my cupboard and was easy to install. It dispenses sturdy, absorbent two-ply towels that save money in the long run. A smart investment!
I mix this with my laundry detergent for an extra boost. It keeps clothes and sheets fresh and clean, even when dealing with sweat and oil.
I was hesitant, but this spa mat exceeded expectations! The powerful bubbles were relaxing, and the water stayed warm. A bit noisy and some suction cups didn’t stick, but those are minor issues. Highly recommend it!
This reusable gift bag is beautiful, with a soft material and a thick satin ribbon. It’s thin but effective, and the measurements were accurate. I’m very happy with it!
If you’re sensitive to stimulants, start with a lower dose of this pre-workout supplement. I found one scoop to be perfect—energizing without overdoing it. Adjust the dose to your needs, and you’ll love it.
I’ll need something else—this didn’t work for me.
These electrolyte packets were a lifesaver! They helped my husband recover quickly after surgery and spared us a trip to the hospital. Highly recommend them for emergencies.
This pill organizer is compact and visually appealing, but it’s overpriced for its size. It’s ideal if you only take a few pills, but wait for a price drop.
These wipes are convenient for camping or quick cleanups. However, they’re not high-quality enough to justify the price.
I couldn’t use this product due to my pacemaker, but my husband loves it for his back and legs. It made a great gift!
These drops provided instant relief from stinging and itching. Very satisfied.
A highly convenient and effective product!
This product made a very subtle difference for me, but I believe it could work better for others. It’s worth a try if you’re curious, as it won’t hurt to experiment.
The flavor is fantastic, but the price is way too high.
