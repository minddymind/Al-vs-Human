solidly built however i do wish the handle was slightly longer

the scent is perfect  better than axe and the reviews were spot on its hard to go wrong with a brand thats been around forever
ive had trouble with various shoes in the past but these inserts didnt meet my needs there were no guidelines for cutting them and they felt stiff and rough i wouldnt purchase these again

best sleep aid ive tried
i received this product around 45 days ago the setup process was smooth and connecting it to the network and tracker was easy however i am experiencing inconsistent results despite following all the steps correctly such as placing it on a hard surface keeping the location unchanged and weighing myself with dry bare feet i still get varying results when i weigh myself multiple times in intervals of one minute my weight fluctuates by 05 to 1 pound and body fat percentages vary by 1 has anyone else encountered similar issues
i enjoy trying different protein flavors to break away from the usual vanilla the piña colada flavor has quickly become a new favorite it strikes the perfect balance not being too sweet or artificial my preferred way to enjoy it is mixed with plain greek yogurt i blend in half to a full scoop and let it chill for a bit before eating this way it completely masks the taste of the whey powder leaving a sweet and highprotein lowsugar treat it dissolves easily in both yogurt and milk for shakes i didnt experience any bloating or digestive discomfort highly recommended for anyone looking to try a new flavor

fits perfectly and its heatresistantno issues handling hot items
this case is a clever design it includes dividers to keep items separated which prevents jewelry like chains and earrings from tangling however the thickness from the dividers is noticeable its wellmade but i think someone will soon create a more compact organizer that still keeps items separate i also wish it came in more vibrant colorssomething like neon green would make it easier to spot in a hotel safe or on a dresser i rely on reviews for smart purchases and aim to help others with my feedback if this was helpful let me know by voting thanks
all formulas are easy to use unlike other pens these arent overnight ones so youll need to time and remember when you start while the results arent dramatic they are noticeable which is still great

this product is a lifesaver i used to spend 100 on acupressure spa visits for neck pain relief after using this for the first time i was nearly brought to tears because it felt so effective it targets sore spots precisely and the heat feature adds extra comfort my only minor suggestion would be for the handles to be loops for easier adjustment between neck and back areas the construction is excellent with solid stitching and a pleasant red glow for the price its an incredible value and has significantly reduced my neck pain i use it before bed and my neck feels much better in the morning i just wish i had purchased this sooner

ive been using this for a while now a tablespoon on an empty stomach works quickly since kava is fatsoluble i take it with almond or coconut milk for the price its definitely worth it heres how i would write the reviews in my style while keeping the meaning intact
the scent fades within  minutes which was a bit disappointing i bought it for my new zealand wool dryer balls and while the smell is nice i think its a bit overpriced considering the quality

if youre looking for something healthy this is it i use the super chlorella powder in my smoothies with ingredients like organic frozen cherries apple carrot celery banana and sometimes even cabbage the taste of chlorella on its own isnt the best but blended into a smoothie its a great way to get my greens its organic rich in vitamins a and b12 and crackedcell for easier absorption no wheat or gluten either its the perfect way to start my day
i wanted to check my ph levels due to stomach issues and im so glad i tried these test strips the first day i tested both my saliva and urine and they were both around  indicating my system is acidic its helpful to monitor ph levels as an acidic system can lead to fatigue and headaches while an alkaline system can cause joint pain and insomnia these strips are easy to use and provide results in just  seconds the bottle contains  strips and includes a helpful chart and directions im now in the ideal ph range
this disney bag is so cute

ive been looking for an organic dandelion and milk thistle supplement and this one is perfect im sensitive to many things but i havent had any adverse reactions to this i dont take them every day but its nice to know im using a supplement thats free from pesticides and chemicals
this is the worst floss ive ever used its so thin that you can barely clean between two teeth before it breaks even doubling it up doesnt helpit still breaks its more suitable for hanging christmas decorations than for flossing your teeth
im impressedit actually works and relieves my pain
i use this to make muesli for breakfast and i love that its organic
the plastic seal was broken when i received this and the twist seal on the lid didnt line up with the grooves so the whole lid came off this caused about  of the bottle to leak and when i opened the box i could smell the lime the scent is pleasant though and i would have given this  stars if it hadnt leaked
bought these for my son and he loves them
best powder ever no more rash under my chest especially in hot weather i will always purchase and use this
this first aid kit is so wellorganized with everything you could need antibiotic ointment antibacterial wipes cold compress safety pins gauze and more it even includes a printed guide for first aid instructions i highly recommend keeping this kit on hand or using it when traveling
my son is a doodler and this was perfect for him
i wasnt sure what to expect as i usually take b12 in pill form the taste is good but my only issue is that the dropper is supposed to measure 1ml yet i can only get about 075ml
its fine the case closes securely which is great since i carry it in my bag where it gets jostled around with my books and laptop i initially worried the pills would mix but it wasnt a problem cleaning it is a little tricky because of the corners but thats to be expected with this type of case the black case isnt fully opaque and the  sign is mostly transparent so if you want to hide the contents this isnt the right choice
after struggling with waking up every night at exactly 3am i found an alternative medical doctor who recommended hepa trope for my liver after two days of using it i slept through the night without waking up at 3am ive been using it for a couple of months now and its made a huge difference the amazon price is much better than what the doctor charges
i use six diffusers in my home daily and ive always bought oils from the same company that was until i tried the oils from salty essential oils the lemon scent in my hall bathroom was amazing and the frankincense and bergamot also smelled fantastic the scents last even after the diffuser has turned off i love that each oil has a description of its benefits such as promoting sleep or relieving headaches what a pleasant surpriseim so glad i gave these a try
arrived on time easy to use and accurate a great product ill definitely order these again
exactly what i expected
this works incredibly well for smelly shoes if you follow the directions i washed my boots and they started smelling a couple of days later after using this for a few days the smell was gone its not a chemical product but it works surprisingly well and leaves no powder residue unlike other products
comfortable easy to use and provides great support
it does exactly what its supposed to
i can wear this tens unit while shopping the main device fits easily in my pocket and setup is quick i love the variety of modes especially the deep tissue option its great for relieving back pain when i pull a muscle the pads last a long time and its one of the better tens units ive tried
this cleaner works wonders on my pandora jewelry though it does smell like eggs as long as you rinse the jewelry afterward the smell disappears and the jewelry looks amazing
this did nothing for me
my favorite part of this is the button that pops open the lid its wellmade and durable
im impressed with how effective these liners are for their intended use they have a silky waterproof material on one side and a soft fleecy fabric on the other theyre perfect for low flow days which is where i feel most comfortable using them for light coverage or as a daily liner theyve worked well
overall this mop and bucket set is pretty solid the mop itself is fantastic the metal pole screws together really securely and the threaded sections are recessed which makes for a sturdy longlasting connection that wont loosen during use the mop head attaches using a snapbutton which is a good quality mechanism my only gripe is the point where the pole meets the mop headits made of plastic while its thick and durable i feel like a metal connection would have been sturdier since thats a potential weak spot the mop head covers are wellmade and attach firmly with velcro and you get two pads in the set theyre machine washable but i recommend hand washing them and letting them air dry flat to preserve their lifespan the bucket design is where things could improve its smaller than similar models which is a plus because its lighter when filled with water however it lacks some useful features like a drain hole at the bottom and its difficult to remove the top for cleaning the handle feels a little flimsy compared to other buckets ive used despite the bucket being a bit of a letdown this is still a great mop set its super easy to get the mop head into the bucket thanks to its springloaded feature that allows it to fold vertically the squeegee works well to wring out the water and having separate wet and dry sides to the bucket speeds up the process and ensures a better clean its not perfect but it offers good value for the price
this product is a great fit for our small rv its made really well too the only issue i ran into is that our headrest is one solid piece and getting it connected tightly is a bit of a challenge
these arent returnable so be sure to think this one through before buying i bought them to replace an old ace bandage but theyre way too short slippery and weak i ended up going back to my old ace bandage and now these are just going to be donated total waste of time and money
i ordered these vitamins while i was away to ensure theyd be waiting for me when i got home theyre recommended by health professionals for women so im hoping theyll live up to the hype
this posture corrector is a bit tricky to get on at first but once you get the hang of it it really does work its effective in providing relief from neck and shoulder pain and its fda approved too
i wore this on flights in january during flu season andmiracle of miraclesi stayed healthy no flu or uri this time first time in three years that ive flown without getting sick
at the start of the pandemic when toilet paper was hard to come by i ordered this bidet sprayer to reduce my tp use i also got these washable bamboo makeup removers which i keep in a cute little ceramic pot on the back of the toilet theyre great for drying off after using the bidet plus when used with a lowsuds feminine wash they help me stay fresh and minimize the need for frequent baths being retired and dealing with dry skin i really dont need to bathe more than once a week as long as i keep things clean down there i like that i can sit on the toilet while doing this reducing the risk of falling i have osteoporosis plus i hear some celebs are advocating for less frequent bathing so i guess im ahead of the trend the packs of makeup removers come with a mesh bag which is super convenient for washing them im really happy with this product and would give it an extra star if i could
we dont use anything else anymorethis product is the best its a little more expensive but its totally worth it it doesnt leave my hair sticky its light and it works wonders the only downside is the smell my daughter is sensitive to it and sometimes freaks out but i assure her its all good even though im often chasing her around
im an adult with incredibly dry and sensitive skin so i use baby lotion per my doctors recommendation this lotion almost worked for me but it doesnt provide the hydration i need it feels okay when first applied but within half an hour my skin is just as dry as before however i do love the sweet apple body wash from this lineits honestly the best body wash ive ever used sadly the lotion isnt right for me
the motif twist is a small portable breast pump thats lightweight and includes a onepiece flange with a comfort cushion it can be batteryoperated which is handy for onthego use while the pump itself is cute it doesnt come with accessories so youll need to buy a tote and cooler separately the pump is quiet and works well but the suction can be a bit loud its a closed pump meaning milk doesnt get into the tubing which is great for hygiene the parts are interchangeable with the motif curve and the comfort cushion makes pumping more comfortable than other models however getting replacement parts can be difficult and the pump is a bit limited in flange size options despite these issues its a solid portable pump that id recommend for anyone who can work with the available parts
shipping was incredibly fast and i actually received three of these thank goodness because one broke while i was figuring out how to use it and the other got deformed it makes a gorgeous bun but the product isnt sturdy enough for repeated use
i needed a new shaker bottle and this one has been great so far its leakproof which is awesome because i throw it in my gym bag without worrying about spills the blender ball works just as well as others ive used and i really like the nonslip grip on the sides and bottom it makes it easier to hold even when its all sweaty from condensation my only wish is that there was a ring or loop on the bottle for an even better grip
it works perfectly fine and for the price id definitely buy it again
this stuff tastes amazing and really helps me power through my workouts
the color is stunning and the flakes are large im in love with this product and if i ever run out ill definitely buy more
this copper magnetic bracelet is beautiful and after wearing it for just a day i havent felt any pain in my fingers which i sometimes struggle with ill update this review as i continue using it
the packaging is perfect for travel a little goes a long way so youll likely get more out of this pouch than expected its easy to dispense doesnt irritate my dry sensitive skin and the fragrance is mild and fades quicklyno migraine triggers which is a big plus the lotion itself blends into my skin easily and leaves me feeling moisturized but honestly the best part is the packaging its super convenient and hygienic especially because i dont need to dip my fingers into a jar every time
over the years ive tried several different supplements including a few free samples from bulk supplements i recently decided to add horsetail to my regimen after hearing about its benefits for healthy teeth and gums i wasnt impressed with bulk supplements versionit just didnt feel fresh after two weeks i couldnt really notice any difference so i decided to try a different brand and the difference was night and day the new one smells fresh and earthy and im already seeing better results bulk supplements version just doesnt cut it for me

i recently switched back to natural nails and needed some good files i was confident the  grit would work and thankfully the  grit did the job too while the  side is a bit rough and not ideal for shaping it works fine for shortening nails the  grit is exactly what i was looking for and its easy to tell the difference between the sides to avoid mistakes
the photos were misleading it only comes with one thick sheet not as expected
these earplugs are comfortable and block loud sounds while still allowing you to hear everything else i use them multiple days a week and have had no issues highly recommend them
these gloves are great theyre long enough to handle dishes and other household chores and you get two pairs in different colors so you wont mix up the kitchen and bathroom gloves they keep my hands clean and do the job really well
the plates are super small and flimsy and the cups are tiny too the napkins and banners are cute but overall the set was disappointing
these gloves are easily adjustable not too tight and resize with ease
the only reason this cane holder gets a single star is because there isnt an option for zero stars the design is poor it lacks instructions and the construction is subpar dont waste your money on this item
i bought these sleeves for my dad and theyve made a huge difference for his circulation ive used these for other body parts like my knees and elbows and theyve really helped with recovery and comfort i recommend them to everyone dealing with circulation issues theyre also the same material used by soldiers in cold environments to keep their feet warm without sweating the quality is excellent and ive shared them with others across the country whove had similar experiences im a big fan of this brand
this toothbrush is fantastic it helps get food out of tricky spots especially with my lower gums that have metal inserts i plan on buying more of these because they come from another country so delivery takes a while but theyre worth the wait
these brittle treats are a unique mix between candy and cookies theyre delicious though my favorite flavor is chocolate chip the only downside is that theyre so good i want to eat the entire bag at once
i absolutely love this brush with thick wavy hair blowdrying and straightening usually takes me forever but with this brush i cut the time down drastically it gets my hair straight without any burns and it even works on hair thats a little damp its honestly a gamechanger for my hair routine and i recommend it to anyone who struggles with timeconsuming hair fixes

eres the next batch of reviews
i tried these pills to curb my appetite and while its tough to remember to take them every day i gave them a fair shot they definitely helped reduce my appetite though the smell is so bad it makes you not want to eat anyway it also helped with detox and bathroom trips but its not something i could add to my regular routine still if youre looking to lose a few pounds or detox its worth a try
i love that this flat iron is cordless it heats up fast and is easy to pack the only downside is the smaller heating plate which im still getting used to for the occasional use like straightening my bangs the charge lasts long overall a solid flat iron
i love these oils but the price has gone up they arent greasy and work well on sensitive skin making them a great option for skin care
the color is pretty but the product unraveled after the second use disappointing
the plug doesnt fit properly into the wall which was frustrating
i mixed this with water and milk and it blended well my wife who is picky about these things liked it too its made in the usa which i appreciate the added fiber and vitamins are a nice bonus though the price is a bit high at almost two dollars per serving well keep using it for the fiber benefits
ridiculous one sheet didnt do anything you need at least  sheets to make a difference
ive been using clear care for years to clean my contacts and ive never had an eye infection however i deducted a star because the double pack only comes with one case and i think there should be two
very deceiving the product looks poorly painted with rubber glued to mediocre glass
well packaged arrived early great price and smells lovely

ive tried the premade version so i wasnt too surprised by the powdered version some reviews claim it tastes terrible but i had a different experience when blended the taste is almost identical to the premade version using a shaker cup doesnt blend it as well but it still works if you just need a quick satisfying shake to curb your hunger i use two scoops as a meal replacement and one scoop to stave off snacking its not as creamy as the premade version but it likely has fewer additives unfortunately ive experienced stomach discomfort so i cant use it as often taking an enzyme pill and a probiotic before helps with the gas
a month ago my blood pressure was  and i had heart issues i started taking a potassium and magnesium supplement and saw some improvement then i read the magnesium miracle by dr carolyn dean and switched to liquid magnesium i saw even better results and my blood pressure dropped to  my doctor reduced my blood pressure medication if you take this product and have high blood pressure consult your doctor as your meds might need adjustment i started slowly with small doses and gradually worked up to  teaspoon a day i also found that mixing it in coconut water helped calm my anxiety this magnesium doesnt have the typical laxative effect which is a plus overall my experience has been positive

this brush is twosided while i like the soft bristles on the back the head could be larger with more bristles the short handle and annoying rope loop also make it less convenient i dont think its worth the  price tag
i love this rope its much softer than most ropes which makes it comfortable and easy to tie knots its  feet long so you might need more if youre planning on using it for extended sessions the rope is durable but the ends can fray so you might want to burn them to prevent that the red color is also a nice touch

i use ziploc bags all the time and i love that this one features the seahawks logo its a perfect fit for my washington home and ideal for giftgiving
this product looks cool but its tricky to open and the meds tend to spill out sometimes
thank you
this works well in foods and as a supplement ive used it before and a little goes a long way
ive had this for a week now its still working but with cats its hard to tell i have a lovehate relationship with cats and one has been ruining my plants i wanted something more humane than a zapper mat or spray so i tried this it has a pleasant scent and doesnt smell like chemicals after a few nights of spraying my plants have remained untouched but im still not sure if its the spray or the cat just hasnt returned
these look better for men than women
these arent  effective but theyre more durable and convenient than homemade options they dont last forever but theyre still a good investment for the price
ive struggled with insomnia for over  years on vacation even in the quietest rooms its hard to sleep during a recent trip to atlantic city i used a silk sleep mask and earplugs and they made a huge difference the mask blocked out the light and the earplugs muted my husbands snoring helping me get some muchneeded rest theyre comfortable and im so glad i had them
this is very comforting though i wasnt into the music feature it arrived charged so i could use it right away but it does have an older usb port
this works well on most surfaces
after trying several facial scrubs im disappointed with this one unlike my favorite scrub which has plenty of exfoliating particles this one lacks enough scrubbies to remove dry skin effectively it doesnt work for my dry skin so i wont buy it again
im not sure what bilberry does exactly but we take it for eye health and night blindness especially as we age recommended by our eye doctor it contains lutein and zeaxanthin derived from marigold extracts
good product does what its supposed to do
i returned this quickly it smelled toxic and the cushion was too firm and raised me too high off the seat plus its pricey for what it offers
great for relieving upset stomachs and heartburn
used these inserts to reduce shoe volume in the toe box they were easy to mold and fit great afterward highly recommend
impressed with the clear sound quality it exceeded my expectations with a variety of sounds i wasnt expecting
this pad improved our old massage table though i wish it were thicker its a good value fits larger tables and weve only tried the cool side so far
works as expected just make sure to align the battery properly with the charger for correct charging
ive used an emjoi micro unit for years and wanted to try this one its quick efficient and does exactly as described one of my best purchases
disappointed with this product its too hard and uncomfortable especially as a neck roll not for me
these last about an hour of continuous use and theyre quite small but theyre overpriced for a chinese product
we tried this to keep feral cats out of our yard but it didnt work as advertised we followed the instructions and applied extra but the cats still used our yard as a bathroom
good price for a natural supplement fast shipping too
the fish oil is wellpackaged clear and the capsules taste great when they melt in your mouth
love it arrived on time and works great with no complaints
these herb combo pads arrived quickly and as described they work well for moxibustion treatment if you know how to use them and they come with helpful paper shields good value
these tissues are disappointing theyre thin not very soft and not worth the price stick with kleenex or store brands for better quality

perfect for larger pills a great product
bought this for my nephew whos dealing with depression and medical issues he loved it especially the black tourmaline which helps cleanse negative energy and promote healing
i use this for fibromyalgia pain relief it works well with a small amount and the strong smell fades quickly just remember to wash your hands afterward
the roller part fell off the stainless steel roller immediately not impressed with the quality and i prefer natural jade or rose quartz rollers
works as advertised ive been using it for six months with great results
bought this for my daughter and it has helped her greatly a great buy
no complaints love the toothpaste
i have foot pain and these inserts help prevent it they replace the need for a golf ball massage
sprayed this on my biking backpack it applied well and though my family noticed the smell it was barely noticeable to me havent used it yet but will update if it doesnt work
these are sharp and uncomfortable
this fish oil has been a game changer for my son with autism it improved his sleep digestion speech and behavior the flavor is pleasant and not fishy and i mix it with yogurt were loyal customers now
the gooad dog clippers work well and are surprisingly quiet great for skittish dogs and the extra attachments make it a great value
the whitening kit lightened my teeth but it didnt deliver miraculous results the instructions are unclear and the process can be uncomfortable its an okay product
exactly what i wantedjust right
anything with gerry gets five stars it arrived on time and in great condition
ive been using this glyconutrient supplement to support my immune system and blood sugar it seems to be working as my blood sugar is more stable and i havent gotten sick its like elephant repellantyou dont see the results but it works
i use this with my monthold baby for the nebulizer and it works wonderfully
the product seems wellbuilt and i have the version with extra padding however the massage strength is too weak for my likingits even less powerful than handheld devices even at the highest setting it didnt feel effective and the heat function didnt work for me either i wouldnt recommend using it while seated and it takes up quite a bit of space so youd have to move it around if there are others sitting nearby
the quality is poorits made of cheap plastic the head doesnt move only the handle does not worth the price
i returned this for a smaller half roll it just wasnt the right fit
one of the best flavors in the balance bar range super tastyalmost like a candy bar i almost regret finding these because theyre so delicious
great product works well and is easy to use highly recommend
i was impressed by its performance but ultimately decided to buy something else instead no big deal
it fits better than cheaper alternatives but its a bit pricey since this model has been discontinued
the pump didnt come with my package which didnt bother me since i have other ways to inflate it however for someone who doesnt have that ability this could be a major inconvenience this product works well if you can inflate it yourself but if you cant i wouldnt recommend it
i placed one in my small office and another in my living room to help with cigarette and pet odors after two months i havent noticed any improvement in the smell or air quality in either room unfortunately i cant return them now
based on the positive reviews i was hoping this would work better i have a herniated disc between l5 and s1 and the product is large and quite hard it ended up hurting my back so ill be donating it to a friend whose father is in a wheelchair
ill wait to see if it was worth the investment the product works but im still deciding about the cost
these socks are fantastic the fabric is soft smooth and feels great on my skin i love how bright and fun the designs aremuch better than the boring tan black or white ones ive seen before theyre a great option for compression socks especially since i struggle with leg swelling the only downside is that when my calves are really swollen the design stretches and loses its vibrancy this doesnt happen with all the pairs i bought but its an issue with some if you dont experience swelling or are thinner this likely wont be a problem it would be nice if the company offered different sizes to help with this
this product works well but dont rush the dosageit can make you feel worse if you increase too quickly start slow and let your body adjust use it with remyte for best results i still find it hard to believe the sellers claim that chloride is removed as it tastes exactly like magnesium chloride
the packaging is exceptionally well done the box is inside another box which ensures great protection the oil inside is light and tasteless and the glass bottle is beautifully designed this exceeded my expectations
absolutely fantastic i use it every day in the shower and it provides great relief for dry itchy skin
excellent product it mixes easily with water making it great for portability ive also added it to fresh strawberries and blackberries for a twist on lemonade its perfect for hot weather and ill definitely keep it in my regular rotation highly recommend
this could be a handy travel razor though i cant say how well it shavesi never got it to turn on i thought the battery might be dead but after charging it it still wouldnt work the shaver warmed up and the charge light came on but that was all the design is unique with the rotary heads in a line instead of the usual circular arrangement but it feels cheap and plastic if it had worked the small size and light weight would have made it a good travel option but since it didnt turn on i can only give it  star
the mounting bracket wouldnt tighten because the material is too weak i tried bending it to fit but it just bent back i had to drill and tap it to make it work the hooks for the basket were also too tight so i had to reshape them to make them functional
i ordered the wrong one but i can still use it
this is the best product ive foundjust like the ones in my big fat greek wedding i always say did you put some glycerin on it for pimples i put it on at night and by morning the swelling is down and its ready to pop i dont even dilute it with anything
im really happy with this despite some negative reviews i decided to try it and it worked great ive used it in a few projects including as an additive to epoxy glue and its brighter and longerlasting than many other watch hands ive used
this brush didnt work for my large cat its not flexible enough and too stiff my cat hated it
this is my third set of better sleep earplugs and i love them my husband has had his nose broken several times so his snoring is intense these earplugs help block out the noise i dont take the best care of themthey often get knocked around or mixed with toys by the cats or grandkidsbut theyre washable and last for  months before i replace them they really work so theyre a great bargain
i cant tolerate all peppermint products but these have a gentle taste that doesnt irritate my acid reflux or hiatal hernia theyre perfect for easing upset stomachs or nausea ill definitely keep these in my medicine chest and kitchen plus i love the tin
not bad overall ive tried bettertasting hydration powders like nuun but this one gets the job done the salt level is lower than others but the saltiness stands out more with this brand it works as expected and i feel just as good after my runs as with other brands i would buy again since its slightly cheaper and offers good value
i prefer to wash my face infrequently because overwashing makes my skin produce more oil but when i need to remove makeup or wash during a shower this wash is perfect it feels gentle and natural and i dont feel like its stripping my skin its a healthy and ecoconscious product
my husband loves this and highly recommends it
this is the only sturdy transparent travel case ive found
update after about  months of occasional use around  times the velcro closure on the band is worn out the straps keep separating even with minimal movement im not a big person so its disappointing that the velcro doesnt hold up if you wear this brace daily you may need to buy replacements despite this the brace works great for improving posture and relieving pain its wellengineered and effective id give it a star rating if i could the only negatives are the lack of instructions and discomfort from the straps overall though this product has been a gamechanger for my posture and pain relief highly recommended
the mask is easy to clean and has elastic to secure it to a childs head however it runs small and didnt fit my yearolds face also it has a strong chemical smell
so far this has worked well ive noticed the cats turning away from the area where i sprayed it the downside is that it needs to be sprayed every other day but if it continues to work ill be happy
great product would buy again
fits better than the original on my arm
its a bit bulky but it does the job
at first i thought this product was just okaysomething worth considering if youre willing to spend the money that was until i had a fallnothing major just one of those silly accidents as i approach  i was in a lot of pain thats when i thought about trying copper calf compression sleeves my calf had taken the brunt of the fall but surprisingly these sleeves worked wonders now im a true believer theyve helped me so much that i also got elbow and hand compression gloves this brand has definitely earned my trust
i really liked this product as did everyone who smelled it the only downside is that the bottle could be a bit larger and the shower gel scent didnt last long
this is one of the best whey isolate protein powders out there especially for those who are lactose intolerant the flavors are some of the best ive had and the chocolate flavor its the best chocolate ive tasted in protein powder form
this back brace is great my only issue is that i bought it for my yearold father and its a bit tricky for him to put on by himself its wellmade and comfortable even when tightened a lot it definitely helps with posture
i like that the days can be separated
it cleans just as they describe
i bought this to help with bruising after surgery it worked a bit but i didnt use it for longabout a weekand i also used ice so i cant say for sure how effective it was
fits fine around my car seat and should work with any bucket seat in a car or truck ill test it further and adjust the review if there are any issues so far it seems supportive i appreciate that theres no memory foam so no odor it was wellpacked in a large box so no issues with the products quality however the air freshener smell stuck to it and it didnt smell like lavender as expected i ended up returning it
very disappointed this didnt hold liquid the opening kept popping open i woke up twice with an empty brush i wouldnt recommend it and went back to using an oxo brush with a screwon dispenser
the review process on amazon has changed now when you read reviews for a product they sometimes arent related to the product youre actually looking at
its easy to breathe in and quite large its also much easier to talk in and washes well
this is pretty sweet but the flavor reminds me of an orange starburstdefinitely not something i want in a drink if youre okay with artificially sweetened drinks it might not bother you i recommend using cold water to drink it it helps cut down on the sweetness i took half a scoop which gives me about 125mg of caffeine similar to a cup of coffee i didnt feel jittery or anxious just a little more focused during my workout overall im not fond of the flavor but the effects are good so ill continue using it and just drink it quickly
these lens wipes work really well and were very happy with them great price for so many
really good i use it every dayits great for my health
i bought this to add to a smoothie recipe and it has fantastic flavor im sure its packed with nutrients id definitely recommend it to anyone who makes smoothies regularly i blend it with frozen cherries banana and orange juice and its spectacular will buy again
solves a common problem most people whove used an ace bandage for a while know that you often lose the clips dropping one and stepping on it can make it useless ive tried using safety pins but they dont hold the bandage evenly this pack of  clips is great theyre not the most durable so i replace them every few days but theyre much better than using safety pins they also come in handy for wider ace bandages which often dont come with enough clips im glad i bought them
good product i buy them all the time
this product shouldnt be sold hereits temperature sensitive and needs to be shipped with an ice pack during warmer months who knows how hot it gets in amazons warehouses id recommend buying it from your local practitioner to ensure it hasnt lost its potency after being exposed to heat definitely a waste of money if its not stored properly
these are super soft and nice but after just a few hours they flattened and became hard i know theyll eventually lose some softness but i expected a little more cushion
theres nothing like a full mesh body puff for the shower but these mitts come close the mesh is thin and sewn onto the glove and it has two finger holes for the thumb depending on how you wear it for a sudsy wash i use the mesh side and for exfoliating i turn it over it also has a loop for hanging it doesnt replace my favorite shower sponge but its a solid alternative plus you can use these for dishes if you dont want to use them for the shower at  its a little pricey at  per mitt but still worth it
i like this product but it only has one hot temperature although it has buttons to adjust the temperature of the brush they dont seem to do anything
the pills are fine and easy to take and i appreciate the quick shipping
my boyfriend needed new clippers and cordless seemed like the best option these clippers are amazing trust me

these worked well at first but they lost their effectiveness after a while not as effective as theyre supposed to be
this machine is amazing it comes with many different attachments and delivers exactly what i was looking for the price is great tooother places wanted  but this one is much cheaper and includes more its strong and totally worth the buy

i got these and while they were a great deal they have a bit of a strong smell at first which took some getting used to theyre somewhat soft but not as soft as i expected from tissue with lotion
these have the strength and feel of highend plastic cutlery theyre labeled compostable in industrial facilities and say you should check locally since many areas dont offer industrial composting these are not suitable for backyard composting however theyre made from renewable sources which is a bonus

the last time i encountered smelling salts was during my childhood when a friend in the neighborhood had a bottle we all tried it and i still remember how overpowering it was these westside barbell smelling salts are just as potent this time i used a technique i learned in chemistry classholding the bottle at a distance and wafting the air toward my nose rather than sticking my face right over it theyre powerful and effective smelling salts
on the first day i had a headache and my jaws were clenched i waited a few days before trying again taking just  of a capsule and stayed on that dose for a week with no side effects after a week i moved up to a full capsule and ive been amazed by the results my energy focus motivation and memory are all back to what they were in my 20s im  and had started to feel like my mind wasnt as sharp but optimind has brought me back to life its well worth the cost especially when you order in bulk even my husband who usually dismisses my supplements now takes one every day with optimind i feel so much more productivethings that used to seem overwhelming like cleaning the garage or shopping are now manageable

weve been using the germ guardian gg1000 pluggable small air purifier since 2016 and it still works great we use it in the bathroom and have never had an issue with it

this set includes 12 individually wrapped bath bombs with various fragrances such as orange lavender frankincense rosemary mint lemongrass vanilla seasalt kiwi rose coconut and papaya i tried the papaya scent upon dropping it in the water it fizzed out quickly without any noticeable suds and the fragrance was barely detectable despite smelling nice in the package the color stained my skin and towels but didnt affect the foot bath itself these bombs underperformed and at 1999 theyre not worth the price
i purchased these noodles online and was pleasantly surprised when my husband and son liked them even though they are used to more traditional pasta the noodles have a thin texture absorb the sauce well and dont take on its flavor as much as other noodles like shiritaki each bag contains four servings and they are high in fiber making them a good option for a healthy meal
for 11 its decent though i didnt use the adhesive it came with since it seemed unreliable instead i used regular doublesided tape which worked much better and saved time
i appreciate the kf94 masks for their comfortable fit especially since they suit my petite face well the ear loops are smaller than most which helps achieve a snug fit however the vshaped cutout at the top of the mask doesnt work as intended for me as it creates gaps on the sides allowing air to enter overall these masks are good for my needs but might not be ideal for larger faces

i was introduced to dmso through my sons running coach who uses it for muscle pain i now use it occasionally for knee pain after applying it leaves a sticky residue for 2030 minutes and the area becomes warm and itchy some users report a garliclike taste in their mouth and frequent use can lead to a garlic scent in your sweat while i find it effective for pain relief its important to apply it properly and with caution as it can penetrate the skin and carry chemicals into the body

as someone who regularly uses sleep masks ive tried numerous brands and styles but this one stands out as the most comfortable the soft lightly padded material feels gentle on my eyes and the lightblocking feature works perfectly when adjusted the straps metal buckle is placed away from my ear unlike most masks preventing discomfort while sleeping on my side its painfree and ideal for side sleepers im tempted to buy a few more as backups for when this one wears out
these are ineffective they dont fly at all and barely spin even when an adult tries to make them work so i cant see how they would be enjoyable for a child
due to health concerns i need to ensure im getting enough protein and this product has been a fantastic addition ive made a frozen mixture that i keep on hand and it boosts both the protein content and the flavor its now one of my favorites
im really enjoying the twixflavored protein the collagen powder adds a smooth texture though youll need a blender for best results the flavor is satisfying on its own but adding a bit of banana or peanut butter can make it feel more like a milkshake either way i think youll find it delicious

ive used the pouron version of this for years on my commercialtype gas stove its amazing what used to take hours now only takes minutes the key is not to use water because it deactivates the chemicals i learned this the hard way now that its available on amazon its a nobrainer for me five stars

i add this product to everything from smoothies to oatmeal even pumpkin custard for an extra protein boost i highly recommend the paleo egg white protein

i found this product difficult to use at first but i hope ill get used to it

the price caught my attention but after using it i noticed water leaking slowly from the side im not sure if its a defect or if its a common issue but other than that its cute and we love it
these might work fine for you but if i apply too much tension on the strap the mask slips off
this guide works great without tugging and the color is perfectits not too dark
this product failed to perform on any of the items i tried it with
to be honest it works for everything that magnesium is essential for it does the job especially given its higher dose since most of us are magnesium deficient a higher dose is definitely beneficial
the high price kept me from buying it for years but after finally putting it on the most used lamp im so glad i did it made a significant difference for my arthritic fingers now i can turn the lamp on and off without any pain definitely worth the investment

this lumbar support is a great addition to my computer chair

i really like this eyelash curler i use it before applying mascara and it makes my eyes look more open
i got this for a family member and since he asked for more i assume hes happy with it
i was excited about the roségold eyelash curler but it arrived in a cheap plastic box that was bent the product didnt look as highquality as the picture and i was disappointed with it
so to start i understand that isnt the most conventional use for the product but it really works the first picture is the start of my shingles flareup my dad typically uses this product for joint pain but he suggested that i use this on the shingles i got it quickly from amazon and slathered a thick layer of the gel onto the painful liquidfilled blisters and bumps i will admit that upon application it burns and tingles but not so bad that its unbearable after a few days the blisters started to dry out a good thing for shingles because it means its healing and after about a week of application to the area the blisters dropped considerably in size and the bumps were almost completely gone i will admit as others have that the only drawback i could see is that it is very drying i noticed that the skin around the bumps and blisters got flaky and dried out i wanted this product to dry the blisters so just be wary if youre using it for pain relief etc
this did things to an old rug i thought not remotely possible  including not animalrelated spots i extremely highly recommend
this weighted pencil holder is not a bad product the grip on it is large so if your kid is more comfortable with a bigger pencil to grip its got that covered the outer portion isnt squishy its sort of a sandy grip which isnt a bad thing either the trouble is that you need to attach this using a tiny allen wrench to tension the grip onto the pencil which means that you have to have the wrench out every time the pencil needs sharpening my boys mash their pencils into the paper resulting in many broken pencil tips the allen wrench never gets put away greatly increasing the likelihood that itll be lost there has to be a better way to make this grip adhere to the pencil but other than that its a great device for helping kids that need this kind of aid be advised this listing was not for the kit i only purchased as per the listing the deluxe grip third from the top its a bit pricey for what you get and ive found a better option so you might want to see if you can find this locally so you can have a look at it before you buy

no complaints about the formulation of this probiotic it hits the mark for both potency 25 billion cfus and strain diversity a total of 10 strains 8 lactobacillus and 2 bifidobacterium strains the specific strains are listed on the bottle but not the specific concentration of each it delivers the 25 billion cfus with a serving size of only 1 capsule 2 caps are the more common situation making this bottle of 30 caps a months supply the downside is the price there are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same or sometimes better potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a months supply while the formulation is solid the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars average equally good options are available that are a much better value
this was useful when i had it gave me an effective way of straightening my hair without burning my skin off lol heheh anyway now i just dont have as much of a problem with my hair being curly so i dont need this as much but i keep it in case i need to straighten my hair for an event or occasion because i dont want to go back to normal straighteners so glad this exists

not bad but i think being that my foot is small it rides up so i find myself pulling it down but when i do that it doesnt cover my fore toe but i will continue to use it because i need to see if it works better its only been 1 day so i will update later
i have trouble sleeping and magnesium seems to help this package of individually packaged doses makes it easy to consume magnesium in liquid versus tablet or capsule form it has the potential to be more potent as it gets into your bloodstream more quickly i also like the taste a bit sweet while i appreciate the convenience of having each dose premeasured for me the doses come in these small plastic vials to get out the entire liquid i found myself biting down on the plastic vial itself as if it were candy and indeed these vials remind me of the candy soda pop vials that kids swilled by biting off the wax top and then drinking the sugary liquid inside its kind of wasteful but i cant deny theyre convenient great for travel but not great for the environment
i have about 4 different kinds of medicine and this is perfect before i bought this i would dig through my purse looking for different bottles but now i just look for my little grey box and everything is right there it has never come open on its own which is also a plus
great workout capris they are a little thicker than expected and the material dries a little slower than other pairs i have in different brands but great for running easy to move in these capris breathable material there is a lot of stretch to these if anyone is trying to figure out their proper size i am 510 162 lbs waist 32 hip 39
you would think every pain relief cream is the same i guess that is what i thought but i was wrong in the beginning i would use bengay you can get it at every store and it works i like the smell of pain relief creams the menthol smell actually is relaxing in itself for me bengay works for us but then at the chiropractor i started using biofreeze i guess i should back up a little my husband has scoliosis so his back always hurts personally i have a neck injury including a spur a midback injury from a car wreck so i have a lot of scar tissue under my shoulder blades i have also just been diagnosed with arthritis in my foot i probably have it in my knees and elsewhere going to a rheumatologist in a few weeks anywayi guess what i am trying to say we have pain we are both pretty active dont like to take a lot of meds but like most do not like pain who does so biofreeze i like biofreeze you can get it in a big pump bottle it is more of a gel and spreads okay it just seems like i have to use a lot icyhot i had to buy that we were running out of biofreeze and the store didnt have bengay icyhot is okay it is hard to spread and it seems like you have to use a lot of product now reliefor i honestly like it i had a chance to try it for a discount in exchange for an honest review i am glad i did i like the consistency it is not a lotion not a gel it is a light blue liquid cream and spreads so nicely i used it on my husbands back and it spreads around so easy he said it didnt feel as hot as others he has tried but i had also just given him an alcoholic beverage and he was feeling pretty relaxed mei tried it on my neck and shoulder knee and foot i like it it brought relief it brought warmth it was easy to put on and absorbed well and is nongreasy i would like to look and see if they carry bigger sizes i would buy this again it is probably my favorite out of all the creams i have tried really so i recommend trying it and seeing for yourself
loved the product just dont think i will order that particular size again too big the adhesion and fit were perfect

ive been enjoying using this sonic face cleansing gadget i had no prior experience with facial cleansing brushes as i was put off by the spinning styles but i knew what to expect the silicone surface acts as the brush and the vibration behind it provides a gentle cleanse there are multiple vibration settings and it has a memory function to recall your last setting its important to remove makeup first with a cloth as the brush is best for cleansing not removing makeup the silicone bristles are soft and ive found it much gentler than a washcloth its more hygienic too while it doesnt create lather it still provides a clean feeling ive been using it for several nights and my skin looks fresh and clean after each use the device is comfortable to hold and i love the base that lets it drain properly overall its been a great addition to my skincare routine

i love these bags theyre sparkly with three types of glittersilver gold and rose gold the material is sturdier than typical gift bags and designed for reuse making them more environmentally friendly theyre small though so theyre better suited for swag bags or small gifts like jewelry the thank you tags are a nice touch but it would have been nice to have other tag options such as happy birthday or seasons greetings overall theyre great for gifting
this tongue scraper works really well without leaving a metallic taste i use it every morning and it helps me feel like my mouth is completely clean to start the day i dry it off after each use to prevent rust and so far its been working great as a fun note i keep it in the same cup as my toothbrush head and if i lift my toothbrush out incorrectly the magnet sticks to the scraper

its cute but it doesnt bend at the waist or tail only the arms this limitation makes it difficult to pose them realistically
at 999 this product offers great value the mask alone justifies the price however if the price were over 1299 i would rate it lower due to the included extras the sleep mask is incredibly soft and blocks out light very well thanks to its eye sockets and adjustable strap unfortunately the eye shade is uncomfortable and ineffective at blocking light and the earplugs are poor quality i would prefer just the mask for the price
my husband says it works wonderfully for his back
i regularly use soylent 20 but this dry version requires mixing with water the texture is slightly gritty even after shaking well and the flavor is more like pancake batter than the premixed 20 which reminds me of leftover milk from cheerios its not bad but its different i prefer the 20 for taste and convenience but can see this being useful for hiking or emergency supplies due to its long shelf life

the size is perfect and it effectively helps with muscle relaxation

moms podiatrist recommended this for her and it works just fine
i mainly use this on my shower curtain and to clean the floor with my batterypowered brush it works really well
the monoi scent is wonderful but its only noticeable if the air vents are blowing at full speed it doesnt act as a freshener in a closed vehicle for the price i wouldnt buy it again
these are meant to be disposable after multiple uses but i often forget and end up tossing them after just one use theyre thicker than paper towels but not as durable as rags so they seem to fall somewhere in between not ideal for the environment but if you need a reusable option these are decent

the canister looks great on my counter which is important to me the product inside provides a good 20g of protein but the chocolate flavor is a bit ruined by the excess monk fruit extract some people might like the sweetness but id prefer a more natural sweetener like organic sugar overall it makes a nice hot cocoa and i like the lack of plastic scoops and clear labeling

this floss tears easily especially if you try to reuse it by washing not great for that purpose

free product given for evaluation  review  this is a good quality amber glass bottle of pure moroccan rosewater the amber glass helps preserve it longer while the scent is a bit stronger than other brands ive used its still pleasant the spray feels a little heavier on my skin but it makes it feel soft compared to other rosewaters this one is slightly less delicate but its still a good option for toning
this battery was supposed to work for my waterpik sr 3000 toothbrush but even after replacing it the toothbrush didnt respond despite soldering the leads correctly the device wouldnt charge properly after 24 hours replacing the battery didnt solve the issue
these pads are fantastic for removing tough residue on cookware and soap scum in the shower they also work great on palm marks on banisters they wear out quickly but theyre the best ive found for cleaning almost any surface

this is a great small tablet thats easy to swallow and doesnt leave a nasty aftertaste its a nice addition to my vitamin regimen and i will continue purchasing it
this product is great for spring cleaning or major cleaning tasks it holds up well and is a better deal compared to other similar products it hasnt been perfect for mold but its still impressive overall
the zip lock works well and ill be buying more
it works well enough i bought it so i could vape in the car without annoying my wife mission accomplished

these files are more suited for buffing rather than fine sanding they perform effectively for buffing purposes but may not be as effective when it comes to shaping
the product doesnt seem as durable or robust as the original tv version it loses its shape more quickly though its priced well the original lasts much longer these will still be useful for a while and help with plantar fasciitis however ill likely stick with the originals moving forward if the original height is too much for you these could be a suitable alternative it seems like a different filler material in the pad id give the originals a solid 5 stars but these are more of a 4
the medium size worked well for my smaller arm its good quality and appears to be durable for the best results its best to use it ahead of time
i gifted this to my boyfriend as part of a beard grooming kit for christmas and hes absolutely thrilled he uses it every day with the beard balm i bought and his beard feels incredibly soft its been a huge improvement he enjoys the sensation and brushes his beard while we watch tv finding it very relaxing
the scrubby side is incredibly soft and my cats absolutely love it on their delicate faces and necks especially my older cat
my first experience with this product left my mouth feeling fresh and clean the mint flavor is mild and pleasant with no burning sensations in my mouth or lips the gel is thick and i had to squeeze the tube a bit harder than usual but after brushing for about two minutes and rinsing with just water my teeth felt bright and clean i appreciate that it doesnt leave a gritty aftertaste and it even brightened my teeth overall a great experience and i highly recommend it
great value for a 6pack  5 stars
the product is of high quality but the pump mechanism broke at the top after the first use its still functional but less so the lotion itself is rich and emollient without being greasy it has a subtle apple scent that fades quickly
these lightweight summer socks dont bind at the top and look great with their ribbed design they stretch well making them perfect for people with edema or sensitive skin my dads caregivers asked me to order more for himive tried several other brands and materials and these are the best
this is very handy for cleaning between toes and it works well i hope they make a longer handle version in the future i bought three and recommend it
very quiet yet effective definitely worth buying
i really like these towels each roll contains 50 cloths with a total of 150 cloths across the three rolls the exterior design is festive starting the roll can be tricky because the first piece is glued tightly but once i get it off its smooth sailing i use them to clean counters or parts of my cats litter boxes theyre strong and reusable the price feels a bit high at 1799 1999 minus 10 off but if they last long and can be reused many times they may be worth it the current price comes to about 12 cents per sheet i would have given 5 stars if they werent so expensive but this might not be an issue for everyone

this is the best product ive ever usedno exaggeration
ive been using these for over a year and at first i liked them however i began experiencing anxiety and shortness of breath which lasted about three months a few weeks ago i ran out of these vitamins and i didnt buy a new bottle since then my anxiety has significantly decreased i havent changed anything else so it seems the vitamins may have been the cause

i expected these to be glass bottles but they turned out to be plastic they look similar to the dark amber glass bottles i have and i even interpreted the 4pound shipping weight as an indication they were glass the product description only mentions the sprayers and dropper with no details about the plastic material im not comfortable using a plastic bottle for something like colloidal silver as i prefer glass unfortunately this product did not meet my expectations and ill be disposing of it the long shipping time and restocking fee were also disappointing

the fitbit aria scale has all the features youd expect from a modern scale but it doesnt do its primary job of providing consistent weight readings well if you step on the scale multiple times youll get different readings each time the syncing over wifi with your account is nice but the inconsistency in weight readings is a major drawback

the package includes a large soft mask and a small cloth pouch the mask fits comfortably and blocks out all light and even though i can open my eyes underneath it i cant see anything its very comfortable wellmade and soft the price of 1259 is a bit high for just one mask but if youre purchasing two the price is much more reasonable the blue color i received is darker than what is shown on the website
