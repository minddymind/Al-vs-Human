1. Unfortunately, I had to return it as it was uncomfortable to ride due to my weight. The return process was disappointing—a $400 charge I’ll be paying off for months. It’s made me hesitant to shop again.
2. It’s unusable for me as it’s much larger than expected. I underestimated how big 20mm would be.
3. After experiencing vision loss, I needed a comfortable eyepatch. This product feels silky smooth and accommodates swelling without discomfort. The strap is gentle yet secure. I highly recommend it over hard plastic alternatives.

345. Works as advertised but requires patience—nails soften overnight.
346. Best delivery system for medication—doesn’t sting and is highly effective.
347. Misleading photo implies multiple bandages, but only one is included—not a good value.

351. I used this product when I wasn’t feeling well, and within just two days, I felt significantly better! It’s also effective for supporting digestive health. The taste is pleasantly balanced—not too strong or bland.
352. Still in the testing phase, but I’ll provide a detailed follow-up review soon.
353. This brand is exceptional—trustworthy and reliable. The supplement performs exactly as advertised. I appreciate the vegetarian capsules, which are easy to swallow, and the fact that it’s manufactured in a certified U.S. facility. Highly recommend, and I’ll definitely repurchase.
354. Extremely satisfied with this product—no complaints at all.
355. Unfortunately, it lacks the power I was hoping for. Wish I could return it.
356. If you’re in the market for phytoceramides, look no further! I’ve tried several brands, but this one stands out as the best. My experience has shown that products from Utah tend to be of superior quality, and this one is no exception.
357. The instructions mention a “handle” multiple times but fail to clearly identify or illustrate it. Also, while it’s supposed to include two dental cases, mine only came with one. Still, the fit was adequate given the price.
358. Very poor quality. The material is itchy, and the craftsmanship is lacking. The item started falling apart almost immediately, and to make matters worse, it’s non-returnable. Strongly advise against purchasing.
359. Works wonderfully for partials and performs equally well on full dentures. It lasts longer than typical store-bought options.
360. Update: This adapter isn’t compatible with brass knuckle round-tip or Stiiizy cartridges but works perfectly for flat-head cartridges. It’s user-friendly, though positioning sometimes requires a bit of adjustment. It enhances filtration, making live resin smoother on the throat. A great addition for anyone looking to upgrade their cartridge-to-water pipe experience.
361. I’ve been using this for three weeks, and while it functions adequately, it’s not rust-proof as advertised. Given the misleading claims, I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller.
362. These are simple, effective, and compact. They work well with most masks that don’t have particularly thick ear loops. Bonus: they’re reusable when paired with disposable masks.
363. Smells wonderful, and the colors complement my bathroom decor perfectly.
364. It’s adjustable and easy to attach to mask ear loops. However, it tends to slide down toward my neck, which can be frustrating. While it alleviates ear strain compared to wearing the mask directly, it doesn’t meet my expectations entirely.
365. My legally blind mom needed an address book to organize her contacts, and this was perfect. It provides ample space for names, addresses, and phone numbers.
366. This is so convenient to use! The wide opening makes it easy to fill with water, and the simple design lets you adjust the temperature quickly. Worked flawlessly right out of the box.
367. While harnessing zero-point energy would revolutionize science, the claims surrounding these products lack credible evidence. In-depth research suggests their efficacy remains unproven, and the demonstrations provided often fail to address serious or visible conditions. Proceed with skepticism.
368. This is the only product that works effectively for my baby girl, alongside their cream. I’ve used it since she was five months old, and now, at 11 months, it continues to deliver excellent results.
369. Perfect for adding a touch of flair. The material is durable, and the jumbo safety pin ensures it stays securely fastened.
370. This was exactly as described. It fits my son’s PS Vita and games perfectly.
371. After several attempts, none of the units worked despite trying different vendors. Great concept, but execution is lacking.
372. Disappointed that the liquid version of Mangosteen is no longer readily available, as the capsules don’t seem as effective.
373. After a week of use, I noticed a significant boost in energy and focus, making it ideal for long workdays. The liquid formula absorbs more efficiently than pills, thanks to advanced liposomal technology. Highly recommend it for anyone needing vitamin B12.
374. I love how this product adds flavor to my water while including collagen. The texture was slightly thicker than I expected, but it blends well. Overall, a great addition to my daily routine.
375. Unfortunately, after months of use, my hair loss remains an issue. Wouldn’t recommend.
376. This is fantastic for keeping my floors clean and shiny. It’s easy to use and much more efficient than sweeping. A must-have!
377. These earmuffs are great! The sound quality is decent, and I like that the cord is detachable. They’re a budget-friendly alternative to pricier brands and fit comfortably.
378. My husband’s glasses no longer slip thanks to these! He even prefers wearing glasses over contacts now. Highly recommend.
379. Frustrated with the price hike on this item. It’s disappointing to see such inconsistency.
380. Very user-friendly and straightforward to operate.
381. Love it! This tool is perfect for my massage work and brings me joy.
382. Sturdy and exactly as shown. Easy to assemble and complemented my rose gold party theme beautifully.
383. A lovely retrospective collection. While not a collector’s item unless signed, it’s still enjoyable.
384. Affordable and effective heating pad. The design could be improved for durability, as mine broke during use. Still, a good option for the price.
385. Gentle and effective for sensitive skin. Works well with body scrubs. Highly recommend.
386. While it’s a cute bulldog design, it’s not suitable as a stress ball—it’s too rigid.
387. Exceptional quality and effortless to use.
388. While the style is appealing, the chain tends to flip over, and the length isn’t ideal. Returned it.
389. Promising so far—seems like a good purchase.
390. These inserts are fantastic and enhance comfort in all my shoes.
391. I can’t handle the chalky texture. Into the compost it goes.
392. These thongs fit snugly and provide firm support, ideal for special occasions. Sizing runs small, so consider ordering one size up.
393. Cleans well but lacks a stronger fragrance that I prefer.
394. This book is fantastic—great condition, thoughtful prompts, and adorable design. However, completing it requires significant time and effort.
395. Not as durable as the original version. Still, it’s an acceptable alternative for those who prefer less height.
396. My husband likes it—that’s all I know!
397. Purchased for my husband’s pain management, and it works wonders! It’s heavy enough for effective use and the strong setting suits our needs perfectly. Might get a backup!
398. A delightful romantic comedy with a great soundtrack. Highly recommend for fans of lighthearted entertainment.
399. Excellent product—couldn’t be happier!
400. Absolutely love it—thank you!
401. Works great  
402. This was a sturdy ice scraper. Mine previously had a broken handle. So I was pretty happy with a new one. This was great because not only does it scrape ice off my car, but it also extends. Mine before hadnt done that. Overall, Im quite content with my purchase.  
403. Very unsatisfied with product no type of suction and it keeps cutting off. I will be returning it.  
404. Cute cover, but as we found out - there are a lot of different Samsungs out there, so this didnt fit. Our fault. Find one for your specific model.  
405. Its just not what it says it is, and that is all. Sadly and disappointing.  
406. Bitter, bitter, bitter I still drank it in different ways, hot, cold, in different rooms, lol. I did not receive a relaxed feeling. I do not foresee me purchasing this product again.  
407. Could have sworn I could return this if I purchased through Amazon. Total waste of money Smells awful WASTE OF MONEY.  
408. I love these They are so much better than I anticipated  
409. These are great 7day pill boxes. They come apart to fill with pills. Once back together, the button in the middle spins by one day with each press. The little dispenser drawer flips down so you can just dump the pills in your hand. Very nice. Lightweight plastic but good quality. Its a little thicker than I expected so my jewelry part use wont work, but I now have colorcoded pill boxes for family travel.  
410. Best glutamine product Mixes well into your favorite drinks Very affordable and great after a workout  
411. Great product at a good price  
412. It is easy to use, and it works. I was thinking it is just another piece of but it really works.  
413. SO MUCH SMALLER than what the size chart said, so I dont know where these are made, but they should check their size chart because Im VERY DISAPPOINTED GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER.  
414. Works great Keep them in the car for after car washes  
415. The three stars are not for the pool itself, which is pretty awesome, but since the company that sells it, Plumstruck, deserves zero stars, I compromised and used three. Other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue, but since the description specifically mentions a ladder, I thought the problem was fixed. When Amazon and I both contacted Plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool, Plumstruck repeatedly ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included. Since the pool is useless, even dangerous without the ladder, this issue must be addressed by the ad. That being said, Amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price, so if the company would just change their wording, people could figure all of this out in advance. Amazon is investigating the company, so hopefully all of this will change. Some people mentioned a heater, but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description. I was actually worried it would only work with the heater and I didnt want to have to use a 220 outlet, so I was relieved that it doesnt have one. If I decide I need a heater later, I will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation. I will never order anything through Plumstruck again. They are a horrible company. If you can find this pool through someone else, I recommend it. It is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage, but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workout. I also want to add that Amazon sells a saltwater conversion system that my local pool store also sells for a lot more money that the pool representative says will work with this pool, so I will soon be able to convert it to saltwater.  
416. Perfect storage case to encase the massager and long plug  
417. These are billed as medium toothbrushes. They are super soft, like little kid toothbrushes. I dont even feel like they are cleaning my teeth. No bristle shedding observed tried two of the pack so far. The head and handle are a little rough, but I didnt experience any splinters. But if your mouth is so sensitive you need this level of softness in a bristle, the wood might be too much for you.  
418. I never thought Id order a broom online, but years ago I bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom I had ever used. I have never found another since then that even comes close. I even replaced the old handle when it broke so I could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones I could find locally. So, I came online to see if I could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after YEARS of hard use. And lo and behold... Amazon had one. I paid significantly more for this one than I did my original one and its worth every penny. This one is bigger... I originally had the 9. The reason I like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it. Id repurchase this several times over, happily. It has made me a broom snob, lol :)  
419. I dont actually know if these work or not, because they are so thick that my feet wont fit into any of my shoes if I put these into them first.  
420. These diapers, if you get the bundle packs off of honestcom, will cost you as much as the organic diapers bought off the shelf. The difference is that these diapers hold sooo well. My son was breastfed the first 6 months, and breastfed babies poo a lot and its always runny. Never had a leak. Organic diapers along with organic wipes and creams have been the only thing that has helped my son and his super sensitive skin. I highly recommend the whole Honest baby line.  
421. Stands up great on solid floors. It is also flexible, making it very easy to use. Gives the added stability needed in a way that’s not as bulky as most. I love it!  
422. Loved these! They were perfect for my wedding pies and my guests loved them!  
423. I love it. Smells so earthly. This stuff gives me so much energy!! I recommend  
424. Good masks. Fit well. Liked the assurance of the filters.  
425. Dont think that they are real propolis or worth it.  
426. I just saw that one of them is already expired. I purchased this on April 16, 2018. The box was expired on Jan 2018.  
427. Perfect size to grip. Its soft but not too soft. Easy to clean.  
428. Lot 792 has a funky mixture. Its different than the usual formula. I hope it is safe and as the label states The last shipments have had this lot so Im wondering if this is the last supply of this product since it seems to be out of stock most places  
429. A little heavy, but its great.  
430. Gets bugs off easy and the bike stayed looking clean Very few bugs stuck after using it.  
431. I really wanted this to work out, and I was originally excited when I first started using this. I was surprised after charging how quickly the battery died, and now it will not charge after only one use. My poor dog looks goofy because half their body was cut (fur was only a couple of inches and well brushed). I will be returning because I am very disappointed.  
432. Been using this for a while on my daughter and no rash at all she can use this product without reacting, thank God. It’s the only thing with a scent that she can use.  
433. Product is a little small, so if you order and want a snug fit, you might want to go up a size.  
434. Smells wonderful!!! This is our second bottle.  
435. Large amount. Works great for saltwater fly patterns. Only thing Id like to see is a pure white color. Other than that, its perfect.  
436. Collagen is a part of my daily routine, usually in coffee, since coffee is part of my daily routine. Each packet has 35 calories and 9g of protein, all from cow collagen peptides. Unflavored, so nothing to interfere or overly sweeten. Pricier than similar collagens, and the serving size is larger than some others as well. Still, these are convenient packets for on the go. The packets are thoughtfully designed, very easy to open. No scissors needed.  
437. Always disappointed when you find out they lie about their size lol. This is NOT 7 inches more like 3. This is definitely a mini massager.  
438. This battery is even better than the original batteries that came with my hearing amplifier So far lasting from 530 am to 7 pm. We’ll see how long it takes to start running down faster. Great buy.  
439. This stuff is the absolute bees knees I only couldnt give it 5 stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted, so about 13 of it was already spilled out. The product itself worked amazingly! My hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job. And even with gloves on, the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands, nails, and nails bed area in filth! I always seem to get black stains stuck to my skin and the dirt and grime doesnt want to come off without a lot of scrubbing, but when I tried this product, I just applied a small amount to my hands, scrubbed, and it cleaned my hands right up without a lot of effort! The best hand cleaner I’ve used in a long time, and I’ve used a ton of them. Its got a pleasant scent too. Please don’t send out damaged containers again, though!  
440. This seems like a nice product. However, as far as keeping it off my vanity - it is so large that it really takes up more space than expected. Still keeping it, though.
441: This small bottle has been a great help in easing my tension and nervousness. I appreciate that it's made from all-natural ingredients with no harmful chemicals or side effects. I'm a big fan of many Bach remedies, and this one is no exception.
442: The brush works well, though it's slightly shorter than expected. It was a bit messy at first with some fibers shedding, but overall, it's the best option for my needs. I needed something that could fit through a narrow bottleneck and preferred to avoid animal bristles for ethical reasons.
443: These are definitely my go-to masks! They fit my face perfectly and are incredibly comfortable. Highly recommend.
444: Unfortunately, these didn’t work for me. They kept slipping off my face, which made them uncomfortable to wear.
445: I had to return these as they weren’t usable in the shower. The box clearly stated "NOT WATERPROOF," which made them unsuitable for my needs.
446: This is, without a doubt, the best film Ving Rames has ever been a part of. His performance was extraordinary, totally out of the box compared to his usual roles. The way he portrayed a gay drag queen showed an incredible depth of empathy and understanding, deserving of recognition, even if this particular film doesn't qualify for an award.
447: Absolutely love it!
448: I bought this at Walmart for $2.64 for a 19.4 oz bottle. Great price!
449: Unfortunately, I can't use the cover for storing or travel as it doesn't fit securely, and it doesn’t sit properly on the base. The bamboo-like popsicle stick is also a bit of a letdown. Might return it.
450: I love the design of the pouring spout – it’s easy to pour quickly, and the attached measuring cup is very convenient.
451: After reading numerous frustrated reviews about digital bathroom scales, I can confidently say this one is an exception. It provides consistent readings, varying by no more than 0.2 lbs, and often stays exactly the same each time. It's a reliable scale and worth the investment!
452: This card feels premium, perfect for professional settings. I will continue buying them, and the sympathy cards are a great value too.
453: L-carnitine is an excellent supplement for overall health.
454: I was looking for latex insoles because I love the comfort of latex bed pillows and have used them in some Naot shoes before. These insoles were just as comfortable, but the size options were limited. My toes didn’t fit perfectly in my shoes, but the rest of my foot felt great. I would buy another pair.
455: Great product and fast shipping. Thanks so much!
456: I love this leave-in treatment! I’ve been using it for years, and it smells amazing.
457: Does exactly what it promises!
458: I had given up on curling lashes with old-fashioned curlers, but this rechargeable lash curler works wonders. It's easy to use, has four heat settings, and a cover to protect it when not in use. The best part? It’s rechargeable, so no batteries needed. I prefer curling my lashes before applying mascara to avoid clumping. At this price, it’s a steal!
459: I’ve used a Genumedi knee support for over 25 years and was thrilled to find a replacement. It offers the same comfort and high quality as the original. Very pleased with this purchase.
460: A perfect large-print Bible for my wife, who is Korean. It’s easy to read and great for anyone who can read Korean.
461: Great product, helps with boosting energy levels.
462: I’ve been using neroli hydrosol for years and was excited to try this supposedly organic version. Unfortunately, it had an overpowering scent, unlike the mild one I’m used to, and caused irritation on my skin. I doubt it's pure neroli.
463: This product does exactly what it’s supposed to. Very satisfied.
464: It arrived earlier than expected!
465: I bought this flameless candle expecting it to resemble a real candle, but the cord and plug ruined the illusion. It looks more like a weirdly lit lamp. The scent is nice when you're close, but the overall design is a letdown. Not worth the price.
466: The product works well, though the inside finish is a little rougher than I expected. Still, it’s a good buy for the price.
467: Simply the best out there!
468: I like this product.
469: This breath analyzer is not entirely precise, but it’s great for tracking alcohol levels over time. It’s small enough to keep in your pocket or car key.
470: At first, I didn’t like this toothpaste due to its fruity taste, but after using it for two months, I’m hooked. It cleans well and brightens teeth without the grit that other products sometimes leave. The only downside was the long wait for delivery, but it was worth it.
471: Purchased for my dog – works great.
472: My wife loves it!
473: Exactly what I wanted and received.
474: Very durable product, and I love that it doesn’t leave grease marks on the outside when food is stored.
475: I really like these socks. They feel silky and are great for my swollen ankles. I just wish they were available in more colors.
476: High-quality part, but it turned out to be too big for my application.
477: After using Drip Drop to replace regular water during my dehydration treatment, I was able to remove my PICC line and return to normal activities. I just wish it were more affordable.
478: As expected.
479: This product is uncomfortable, and I can’t fall asleep with it on.
480: I like the taste, but I’m not a fan of some of the ingredients.
481: There are only two bags in this order, not four as expected. They are very small, more like small and extra-small sizes. While well made and attractive, they aren’t worth the price.
482: Perfect product, just as expected. Would recommend.
483: These don’t work at all. I still see trails from whatever is digging in my yard, and one of them was even moved after just one night. A waste of money.
484: The tags are pretty, but keep in mind that you have to pay for returns.
485: This product works well and I’m satisfied with it.
486: It’s okay, but I thought it would be a little sturdier.
487: This brush feels great and glides easily through my fine hair. It’s also very comfortable to hold.
488: I bought these for facial pain relief, and they fit perfectly. I use flour sack cloths as covers, and they work wonders for my migraines. They have truly made a difference.
489: Nice and comfortable.
490: It was really convenient having everything in one package.
491: These are perfect for my elderly grandmother. She can easily reach her back with them.
492: I have a 6-year-old boy, so I use these all the time for him and for DIY projects around the house.
493: I lost 9 lbs in just 10 days—something I never thought would happen. I’m so pleased with the results and have already ordered more.
494: The material is great, and my cat loves it.
495: If you’re on the fence about this product, go for it! It really helped with my hormones, even with the hormone issues I’ve been dealing with.
496: I’m focusing on making healthier choices, and this product is part of that journey.
497: My holistic doctor recommended this to help absorb toxins. The method is to add 10-15 drops to hot water to neutralize harmful components in cilantro. I've been taking it alongside other detox products and herbs.
498: Dr. Mercola’s name guarantees quality, and I trust this filter wholeheartedly.
499: This kit is not top-tier quality, but it’s a good starting point for learning to tattoo. It includes everything you need to get started: two guns, needles, practice skin, and more. However, there are no instructions, so you’ll have to figure things out online. One of the guns arrived broken, and the other stops working randomly. While the quality isn’t great, this kit can be helpful for practicing on non-skin surfaces. But if you want to tattoo real skin, you’ll definitely need to upgrade.
500: The product was exactly as described.
501: The mat arrived without a protective plastic cover, only shipped in a thin box, but thankfully, it wasn’t damaged. Made in China, it appears to be well-constructed and durable. The bristles are firm yet gentle enough not to cause discomfort. However, the suction cups hold only partially, making it better suited for use on feet rather than the back.
502: This product has been a lifesaver for my toddler’s eczema! It’s incredibly moisturizing and seems to calm flare-ups effectively. It outperforms similar products like Aveeno. Highly recommend!
503: Fantastic.
504: Exactly as described! The size and look match the listing, and the suction works perfectly—staying in place unless intentionally removed. It shipped in a bubble mailer, and the quality is solid. Great product!
505: A delightful addition to my stationery collection! The panda-themed tape is charming and practical for letters, packages, or personal correspondence (though not ideal for business use). As a lifelong panda enthusiast, this tape brings me joy and adds a playful touch to my communication. The ability to cut individual pieces or use it as a roll makes it versatile. Highly recommended for animal lovers!
506: My son was experiencing foot pain with his baseball cleats, so I tried these arch supports as recommended by his pediatrician. They worked perfectly—no more discomfort. A great solution!
507: This set is ideal for summer! The glitter polish has a beautiful, dimensional sparkle, while the other shades are bright and highly pigmented. You only need one coat for excellent coverage.
508: After weeks of searching local grocery stores, I finally found this item. It works wonderfully, making cleaning tasks so much easier. Highly recommend it!
509: I’m new to this product, but so far, I’m impressed. I plan to keep ordering—so good!
510: If I could go back, I wouldn’t choose the white enamel Kohler sink. Cleaning it is tedious; you need specialized cleaners for stains and marks. It’s overpriced for something that can’t be maintained with simple soap and water.
511: These filters are a fantastic addition to reusable face masks. They provide an extra layer of safety and reassurance. Highly recommended!
512: Don’t overlook this movie—it’s amazing!
513: Thank you!
514: I love the refreshing feel of Venus Aqua 24 Deep Moisturizing Cream on my skin. The scent is also fantastic!
515: Initially worked okay, but now it won’t even turn on. When it did work, the current was felt more in my hand than at the intended area. Very disappointing.
516: Although it arrived later than expected, the eyeliner is decent for the price. It’s not very waterproof or smudge-proof, but it works in a pinch.
517: The door operates very slowly and inconsistently. For the price, I wouldn’t recommend it.
518: A great tool for adding fine details to woodworking projects.
519: This bag is lightweight yet spacious. I can pack it to its full capacity without issues!
520: This tonic has boosted my energy and made daily tasks around the house more manageable.
521: Great battery life and performance, although it’s slightly heavy.
522: Excellent!
523: This adorable eyeglass holder serves its purpose well, preventing scratches and making it easier to locate my glasses. The craftsmanship is impressive, and the design is both functional and stylish.
524: This recovery drink is a perfect balance of natural nutrition and delicious flavor. It’s hard to believe it’s so healthy!
525: This large pill organizer is a great value for anyone taking multiple daily medications. The smaller one is handy for travel or gifting.
526: Simple and easy to use.
527: I love these vibrant decorations—they’re perfect for entertaining and last a long time.
528: The item didn’t meet expectations; the chips were mostly pulverized despite being advertised as large. Very disappointing.
529: The bag quality is good, but I received adult pandas instead of baby ones, which didn’t suit my crafting project.
530: Super effective and tastes great!
531: The detergent performs okay but lacks the minty freshness I was hoping for.
532: This product is overly loud and ineffective. Save your money—it’s not worth it.
533: I liked the product.
534: Lightweight and convenient.
535: A reliable solution for noise reduction. Paired with earmuffs, it provides excellent results, especially for sleeping.
536: Cheap and ineffective—it doesn’t clean well or leave clothes fresh.
537: Well-made and versatile sizes. I bought another set for my partner, and she loves it too!
538: These soaps are stunning, with beautifully balanced scents. My favorite is lemongrass, but all the varieties are lovely.
539: This smells incredible—I love it!
540: A practical solution to prevent scratches and keep glasses in one place.
541: While not as comfortable as prescription frames, these are good to have around the house for backup use.
542: I searched everywhere for these batteries, but Amazon came to the rescue—quick and reliable as always!
543: PROS: The chair has a sleek appearance and feels solidly built. CONS: The leg massage is painful and unpleasant, relying on airbag compression rather than rollers. Even on the lowest setting, it was highly uncomfortable. It lacks features expected in its price range, such as memory settings. Recalibrating the massage heads for height and width every time is tedious. The shoulder and neck massage is weak and difficult to adjust comfortably. The faux leather material is standard but doesn’t add any premium feel. Overall, it feels underwhelming compared to other options in the $2,000–$3,000 range.
544: This face steamer is simple and effective. Fill it with water, switch it on, and wait 3–4 minutes for the steam. Once ready, it works beautifully. Setup and operation are straightforward.
545: I discovered this adhesive while on vacation in Australia and was impressed. It stayed firmly in place on my injured foot without leaving any sticky residue.
546: A fantastic alternative to heated socks—definitely worth the investment.
547: Unfortunately, I received the wrong item: white cheddar crisps instead of my intended choice. Exchanging didn’t feel worth the hassle.
548: I regret spending so much on this item. It broke completely at the hinge within three months—poor design and not compact. I recommend investing in a higher-quality option to avoid the frustration I experienced.
549: The item arrived early and made for a wonderful gift—very pleased!
550: Perfectly simple and functional cups, great for party favors.
551: These are adorable! My husband loves how they complement our RV decor.
552: This product delivers great results for making smokes and saves a lot of money.
553: Stylish and exactly what I was looking for—love it!
554: Unfortunately, this didn’t work for me. Either I’m an unsophisticated consumer or it’s unsuitable for my needs—duct tape might have been a better alternative.
555: Given as a gift and well-received! The recipient found it beautiful and was thrilled. Highly recommended for gifting.
556: While I couldn’t use this product due to my narrow feet, the company was kind enough to issue a full refund.
557: Not ideal for thick hair—it takes a long time and requires small sections. However, the curls are lovely if you have the patience.
558: An excellent product that works just as expected!
559: The soft, colorful toothbrushes provide a deep clean while being gentle. Perfect for families, picnics, or everyday use.
560: A good brush that gets the job done, though it won’t replace a flat iron entirely.
561: Delivers a smooth, close cut—exactly what I needed!
562: Three stars because I’m unsure whether the sizing issue was my error or the product’s. It didn’t fit as expected, especially on the extended front piece shown in the product photo.
563: Very satisfied with this purchase—would definitely buy again.
564: Nixoderm is amazing! It cleared my rashes in just a week. It’s been a family favorite for generations, dating back to my childhood in Jamaica.
565: I first bought this product in Australia and have been thrilled with the results. My nails, skin, and hair are healthier and grow faster. I highly recommend it over other products for hair, skin, and nails.
566: Perfect in every way—couldn’t ask for more.
567: These are well-made and comfortable—a great choice!
568: This facial cleansing brush is fantastic! I charged it once and have used it daily for a month. The charge holds well, and the included brush options cater to different needs. It’s been transformative for my oily skin, reducing clogged pores and leaving my face shiny and soft. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a durable and effective facial brush.
569: A bit too soft for my preference, but the toothbrush’s excellent features make up for it. I still use it regularly, so it must be doing something right!
570: Excellent quality—a product worth every penny.
571: A delicious and satisfying meal replacement option.
572: This aromatherapy necklace is stunning and functional. I love that the pads can be swapped for different colors or scents. Whether for personal use or in support of someone else, it’s a versatile and meaningful accessory.
573: Yellow readers are rare, but these are a gem! They fit well, the bamboo temples keep cords in place, and they don’t cause headaches. A fantastic find!
574: While it cancels some noise, this product didn’t meet my expectations.
575: My husband’s snoring was unbearable, but this snoring strap changed everything! It’s comfortable and effective, though it slides a bit during sleep. Overall, it’s a game-changer and worth considering if snoring is an issue in your household.
576: Simple and reliable—it does exactly what it promises.
577: The paper is charming and high-quality. Wrapping gifts with it was such an enjoyable experience.
578: I appreciate the variety of sizes—very practical and convenient!
579: Crispy with a delightful buckwheat flavor—truly satisfying.
580: As I mentioned earlier, this is an amazing deal! I started with this pack and later upgraded to the 100-pack (6,000 papers) when I ran out.
581: Works exactly as advertised.
582: While it kept me from rolling onto my back as intended, the directions were minimal and confusing. The strap is uncomfortable, rigid, and bulky—almost like sleeping on rocks. Strapping it across my chest wasn’t ideal as a woman, so I opted to wear it around my waist despite the directions advising against it. The waist placement worked fine, but I’ll replace the straps with thinner, more flexible ones. Although this was the only option I could find, it could be vastly improved with better design and clearer instructions. Inflating it was also a hassle.
583: This chin strap is a major upgrade! It’s strong, well-constructed, and simple to adjust and wear.
584: This writing guide has been a tremendous help for my dad and brother, who are losing their sight. It enables them to manage their finances independently, and I highly recommend it.
585: Easy to grip and versatile for both wet and dry use. It doesn’t take much effort to achieve a smooth finish, and the labeled design is a nice touch.
586: Unfortunately, my initial set arrived broken, and the replacement set broke as well. These are cheaply made and not worth the hassle.
587: The product itself is fine, but the packaging is excessive and wasteful. A simple sealed bag would suffice and save costs for both the company and customers. While I trust the product works, I’ll switch to a more affordable option as soon as one is available.
588: I first tried the liquid version of chanca piedra for fast relief and later switched to the pill form for convenience. Both worked equally well, but the pills are easier to manage since they require less frequent dosing. This product has been life-changing for managing kidney stones naturally without costly doctor visits.
589: This 10 lb. bag of Organic Whole Grain Hulled Barley is exactly what I expected. It’s decent as a breakfast option with potential blood sugar benefits, but preparation is time-consuming.
590: Absolutely delicious!
591: The hard, round component that fits over the knee was uncomfortable and ended up causing more pain than relief.
592: After a long search, I finally found this simple cup with a simple lid at a reasonable price. It’s perfect for making shakes without any unnecessary features.
593: The seam along the bottom of the sock makes it uncomfortable to wear, and I noticed the sizing runs large.
594: My granddaughter adores her doll! She plays with it constantly, changes its clothes, and truly enjoys this wonderful gift.
595: This massage chair is my personal escape. While it doesn’t replace a professional massage, it outperforms the options available locally. A worthwhile investment that leaves me feeling rejuvenated.
596: Thank you—it’s exactly what I needed!
597: This product never fails—I’ve successfully taken a deer every time I’ve used it. That said, it works best when deer are already in the area.
598: Delicious and filling, keeping me satisfied until my next meal.
599: A fantastic trimmer that effortlessly handles beards, mustaches, and even intricate hair designs.
600: After my son teased me about my smaller reading glasses, I switched to these, and they’re perfect! I love that each pair comes with a slim case.
601: Purchased these for my husband, and he’s very happy with them. The fact that they fold flat for easy storage in a drawer or under a chair is a great feature.
602: I expected this product to remove hair entirely, not just trim it down.
603: While results may vary, I found this product unpleasant and irritating to my sensitive teeth. The pen is harder to use than strips or trays because it’s difficult to get into tight spaces. Sensitivity became an issue almost immediately, making it a no-go for me.
604: I do think this product works. Years ago, I used it right after finishing a round of Crest Whitestrips, which didn’t show much effect on their own. With Celebrity Sexy Teeth, I saw quick and dramatic results. The name might seem questionable, but it truly delivered. Perhaps the combination of the two products made the difference.
605: Delivery was prompt, and the product matched the description perfectly.
606: Simply plug it in and enjoy a bubbling Jacuzzi-like experience in your tub. It can be a bit loud, but placing the canister outside the bathroom door helps. Ideal for small spaces and incredibly relaxing—hard to leave the tub!
607: A good idea in theory but unsafe in practice. The silicone tip detached and went down our dog’s throat on the second use. Thankfully, our dog is large and wasn’t harmed, but this could be dangerous for smaller pets. Not recommended.
608: Shipping was slow, but the quality of the image was good.
609: The product does not hold up as shown in the pictures—quite disappointing.
610: Beautifully crafted bags. I’ll definitely purchase them again.
611: Slightly smaller than expected, but still a good value overall.
612: I first found this product at HomeGoods for $11.99. After failing to locate it again, I paid double online, and it was worth every penny. The taste is pleasant, and I noticed improved joint flexibility within two days. I hope to find it in-store again, but I’m willing to pay more for the benefits.
613: My one-year-old grandson loves this little panda! He carries it everywhere, scribbles with it, and erases by pushing the nose. Such a cute and fun product.
614: A unique product with strong vibrations and several mode options. The tight rubber ring can stretch the skin when moved, but it adds to the experience.
615: Works only on hard surfaces due to the small rollers, which don’t lift properly on carpet.
616: With multiple pets, keeping the floors clean is a priority. My Swiffer does an okay job, but this mop and its reusable heads make my floors look spotless every time.
617: The koala cloth was lovely, but the leather cord had an overpowering chemical smell. Attempts to remove the smell made the leather stiff and unusable for now.
618: None of the instructions or details were in English, and the contents had a strong chemical odor.
619: A straightforward and effective solution—very easy to use.
620: The package only included five items instead of the advertised six, but they work well.
621: The taste was unbearable, and even mixing it with juice didn’t help. The aftertaste was equally unpleasant.
622: Exactly what I expected—always a reliable purchase that works perfectly.
623: Initially, I was upset because the product seemed like a cheap piece of styrofoam. However, after using it for back pain relief, I slept pain-free for the first time in weeks. It works as promised and deserves high praise.
624: If I could give zero stars, I would. This product is rigid, crinkles immediately, and is unusable for wrapping gifts. Avoid at all costs.
625: Using this device caused me immense pain. Despite the positive reviews, I can barely sit or stand after trying it.
626: As a professional nail technician, I love these nippers! They’re sharp, durable, and I’ll definitely repurchase regularly.
627: One of my go-to tools for use while watching TV on the couch.
628: The scent doesn’t resemble sandalwood, and the lack of a plastic seal makes me suspect it was tampered with. Extremely dissatisfied.
629: A great paint cleaner to use before waxing—it effectively removes dirt and swirl marks.
630: Replacing two smaller filters with this larger one was a smart choice. It’s easier to handle, and the spare ensures my furnace stays happy.
631: These are surprisingly sharp—handle with care!
632: This product worked wonders for my husband, who was losing his voice due to throat muscle atrophy. After one month, his voice has fully recovered, and it’s been a cost-effective alternative to therapy.
633: Love the color! The tip is loose and needs occasional tightening, but it’s manageable. However, there’s no safety shutoff feature, so be cautious to avoid accidents like the one we had when it burned the carpet.
634: The variety box included only two flavors instead of the advertised selection, which was disappointing. While the taste was okay, the sunflower flavor had a slightly stale, oxidized quality.
635: Bought this as a gag gift, but it turned out to be incredibly useful. The recipient uses it all the time and loves it!
636: A refreshing alternative to standard lemon cologne.
637: Fast shipping, no complaints.
638: Bought these for my mom, and she couldn’t be happier with them.
639: Sturdy and sharp—excellent quality!
640: Just as described, very satisfied.
641: The directions were only in Chinese, and the packaging looked cheap, like something from a dollar store. Very disappointed.
642: I was initially frustrated by the lack of product details but ended up delighted. It’s big enough for a large bulletin board and comes with a border and instructions for placement. The design is engaging for young children.
643: This product did not meet the manufacturer’s claims. While it provided minimal results, it didn’t live up to expectations. I wouldn’t recommend it.
644: My daughter has always struggled with swimmer’s ear, but this headband and ear plug set has been a game-changer. The silicone plugs are soft, moldable, and effective, while the band keeps them secure and prevents water entry. Fantastic product!
645: The floss is thin and harsh on gums, but I bought it for the reusable jar. I’ll use a different brand for refills.
646: These bags were a lifesaver during the holidays! Sturdy, cheerful, and available in various sizes, they made gift wrapping a breeze.
647: I wish this product was still available. The white coating is helpful for those sensitive to red dye.
648: I love water transfers, but these were inflexible and tricky to apply. They also transfer incorrectly and require flipping over. An okay product, but I wouldn’t repurchase.
649: Lightweight and comfortable sunglasses perfect for everyday use and outdoor activities like hiking, biking, or golf. Great lenses and frames.
650: I can’t sleep without this pillow! I don’t use it for my neck but between my elbows to keep my shoulders aligned. It prevents knots in my upper back—highly recommended.
651. This container is ideal for travel or everyday use! Whether it's medicine, earrings, or other small items, it provides an excellent way to keep them safe and organized.  
652. Just as described!  
653. Unfortunately, this did not meet my expectations. The suction power was too weak to effectively pump, and anything beyond level 4 caused discomfort. Despite trying for over 15 minutes, I only collected a small amount of milk. When attempting to pour it into a bottle, the suction part detached, spilling the milk everywhere. Very disappointing.  
654. Good quality product.  
655. These work perfectly and fit the brush exactly as needed.  
656. I’m giving this a shot, and since it contains mostly natural ingredients, I’m hopeful it won’t interact negatively with my other medications. Hot flashes and night sweats are a nightmare, and I’m really looking for something to help manage them. However, the word “promotes” in the product description feels a bit off. It would have been more reassuring if they used terms like “prevent” or “help ease.” I’ll see how it works after completing the full bottle.  
657. The odor is very strong. I need a few more weeks of use to provide a more thorough review.  
658. These forms are great! They look and feel nice, and the price is affordable. The quality is excellent, and I’m very satisfied with my purchase. The seller’s service was great too.  
659. Our dog has been using this for a year now, and it’s still going strong. We didn’t receive the soap, but we bought the On Guard soap separately, and it’s great. I’ll definitely purchase again.  
660. Works decently well, but be cautious if you have sensitive skin.  
661. This product doesn’t clump at all, which is fantastic. The flavor is amazing, and the Beta-Alanine kicks in gradually, which helps me feel it throughout my body, not just a quick burst. I would definitely repurchase.  
662. After searching several RV websites for replacement clips for our sliding doors, I finally found these. They're made from strong plastic but can become brittle over time. These clips worked well and helped keep the doors secure while traveling.  
663. I bought these for my nieces and nephews because I loved them as a kid in the 70s. The kids enjoy them too!  
664. Great product!  
665. This will not connect to a hose outdoors, so be aware of that.  
666. I go through gallons of this every year. I don’t leave home without it.  
667. This is all you need to clean anything and everything.  
668. I purchased this for my blind brother, so I can’t speak much about its functionality. However, he mentioned that while the volume could be louder, he still likes it and finds it helpful.  
669. Super cute product!  
670. My experience with Pink Zebra has been terrible. Not only did the items I ordered smell awful, but trying to return them has been an absolute nightmare. Customer service has been unresponsive, and I’m left with no resolution after nearly a week. I’ll never order from them again.  
671. This is exactly what I was searching for.  
672. They look a little nerdy, but they work wonderfully. I use them for driving and walking in the sun.  
673. Loved it!  
674. Very comfortable and keeps sandals from sliding around.  
675. High-quality brass brad—just what I needed.  
676. These energy pills are amazing! They help me stay focused and energized, and I’ve had no side effects. Great price for a product that works effectively.  
677. These capsules are smaller than others I’ve used, but that’s actually great because they fit perfectly in my pillbox. They work well for me.  
678. I have CKD and anemia, and these B12 capsules have been very helpful for my kidneys and hemoglobin levels.  
679. I bought these in XXL for myself and was very happy with them. I ordered a smaller size for my grandson, but the quality didn’t meet the same standards. The socks are still comfortable, but I’m not sure I’ll be purchasing from this seller again.  
680. I’ve been storing this in my skincare fridge and using it to apply serums in the morning. It feels amazing and helps reduce puffiness, especially on my jawline.  
681. This product truly works!  
682. Comfortable to wear with sandals—great addition to my wardrobe.  
683. Update: I initially really liked these sleep masks, but after using them for a while, the red one left black marks on my sheets, which won’t wash out. The earplugs are a nice touch, and I like that there’s no pressure on the eyelids. However, I had to adjust the nosepiece to make it more comfortable, and I’m concerned about the longevity of the mask.  
684. Unfortunately, this product didn’t help with my back pain. I would not recommend it.  
685. This BCAA drink works well as a hydration supplement. The flavor tastes more like a beverage than a supplement, which is a plus. If you want a stronger flavor, you might need to use more, but I recommend using less to make it last longer.  
686. Excellent product with great flavor.  
687. I love this laundry detergent! It cleans well and is eco-friendly. Plus, it smells wonderful. I’ve used several products from this company and have had a great experience every time.  
688. This product has really helped with my back and rib cage pain. The only issue I had was that one of the straps dug into my shoulder, but that might just be a personal issue.  
689. We love this product!  
690. I ordered this as an indoor mosquito repellent. It works well but not as effectively as the Vanilla #3. If you come across it, please let me know!  
691. These stockings are soft and comfortable. They stay in place all day, and they’ve been great after my sclerotherapy treatments.  
692. I love this SPF 30 lip balm! It’s smooth, not greasy, and the flavor is subtle. I’m glad I got the 24-pack because now I can apply it freely without worrying about running out. Great deal!  
693. This is perfect for my little minion!  
694. The fabric is very nice and easy to work with, plus it’s adorable.  
695. This product has an amazing smell! It’s wonderful for adding gloss to natural hair or braiding hair.  
696. It was easy to assemble and such a great purchase. It’s not only a gift box for my daughter’s present but also perfect for storing her toys, drawings, and cards.  
697. This is perfect for my son with ADHD and my son with autism!  
698. They do exactly what they claim to do.  
699. After removing my nails post-Covid, I found it hard to clean my scalp properly. This product works like a charm, massaging my scalp the way my nails used to.  
700. I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this cast iron cleaner. It’s easy to use, and I’ve had no issues cleaning my pans or baking trays. Highly recommend this cleaner.
701. While I really like this product, the goggles are slightly small for a 7-year-old.  
702. I have severe insomnia, and unfortunately, this product didn’t help me, even after taking more than the recommended dose. However, the company offered a 100% money-back guarantee, which I appreciate. So, 5 stars for the company, and 2 stars for the product itself—though it might work for others.  
703. This lash curler works wonderfully. It curls all lashes evenly and includes a light to help you see as you curl. The rubber changes color from red to white when it's ready to use. Keeping it clean ensures amazing results!  
704. Cleans thoroughly, smells great, and is safe for cloth use.  
705. We’ve been using these liners for our 3-month-old since birth, and they work great, even though he is a heavy wetter. They’re incredibly soft and fit perfectly into any cover, including our favorite, the Ramparooz covers, which don’t have snaps. These liners stay in place and do their job!  
706. This is a quality piece for the price. It’s perfect for my PA, especially since I don’t like the large diameter rings.  
707. This product works wonders for menstrual cramps and is incredibly effective. The only downside is that it’s quite expensive, and I tend to use a lot of it, so it doesn’t last as long. Nonetheless, I’m on my second bottle and plan to stick with this brand, as it’s much easier to ingest than other harsher options.  
708. This is perfect as a party favor!  
709. Ted’s Pain Gel has been surprisingly effective for pain and discomfort. To get the best results, follow the instructions to use it 3-4 times a day for the first week.  
710. A great replacement part for the Decor SeaSprint throttle pin. Just make sure to observe how the old pin is installed before removing it.  
711. This is very thin and too short for use on a thigh. Even on a calf, it doesn’t wrap well.  
712. These are super cute and really soft. They’d make a great #2 present to accompany a #1 gift or could even stand alone as a #1 gift. I bought three of these heart pillows and gave one to my best friend's daughter, who absolutely loves it!  
713. I love it! It works exactly as expected.  
714. I chose these because of their solid red and white colors, which is exactly what I wanted.  
715. The quality of this eye mask is average, and the craftsmanship isn’t outstanding, but it’s okay for temporary use.  
716. Works well! My wife used it to trim an ingrown toenail, and it did the job just fine. It’s very sharp and outperforms regular nail clippers.  
717. Great price and good quality—very satisfied!  
718. I like it a lot. It’s very convenient to use.  
719. Unfortunately, it didn’t work the way I had hoped.  
720. 🌞🌞🥲 These do not darken as shown in the pictures. Instead, they only get a slight gray tint in direct sunlight. I should have returned them, as they don’t function like sunglasses at all. Very disappointing, especially since they didn’t offer much protection from the harsh Texas sun! 🌞🌞😎😎😎  
721. We bought these for our guests at the wedding and reception, and they were perfect.  
722. This product works better than anything I’ve tried, and it keeps working. I’ve used other energy supplements that stopped working after a while, but I’m on my second bottle of this one. Definitely sticking with it.  
723. Not only was the product from a different brand, but the ad was misleading. It showed 9 boxes, but only one arrived, making this purchase overpriced. To top it off, the item is non-returnable.  
724. I bought this for my wife after she gave birth. The binder is well-made and fits perfectly, although it’s a bit stiff, but it should soften over time. It provides great support and works as intended. Definitely recommend for anyone needing an abdominal binder. (I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.)  
725. The distributor was easy to work with when I needed to return it, but the product seemed poorly manufactured. I ended up purchasing one from another site, although it was more expensive.  
726. I ordered these after seeing them on TikTok for cleaning. When they arrived, I was surprised at how much larger they were than expected. The kids are excited to use them for outdoor fun this summer!  
727. This is an excellent product. I bought it to help after knee and hip surgery, and I was impressed with the quality given its affordable price. It’s a great wheelchair and can even be used as a substitute for a walker. When you're up and about, you can use the seat to carry items like laundry or books. Highly recommend it.  
728. Unfortunately, this product stopped working after the first use.  
729. I don’t recommend this toothbrush. The heads fell off while brushing, there’s no timer, and no indicator light showing it’s charging. Waste of money!  
730. These tissues are fine, but I needed them to be the size mentioned in the description (20 x 26). The packaging, however, states they’re 20” x 20”.
731. This product exceeded expectations! My daughter found Rocyalox simple to use and is thrilled she no longer needs to rely on rubber bands. Highly recommend this product, five stars all the way!  
732. It works wonderfully with dentures.  
733. This is my first foam roller, and I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It's quite firm, which is expected, but it's smaller than I anticipated. I wish it were a bit bigger, but it still works well for stretching out my back. It took some getting used to, but overall, it's a solid product.  
734. Small metal tray, exactly what I needed. I had been searching for a deep tray for some time. The artwork is sharp and clear, no pixelation. After a month of use, the graphics haven't worn or chipped. Easy to clean with rubbing alcohol. I'll likely buy again, especially if they offer a larger size.  
735. Immediate relief! Fantastic product.  
736. I placed it on my desk on top of a notebook, and when I returned, it had left an oily stain on the paper. Not ideal.  
737. These were perfect tablecloths for our sports-themed party. They look like grass, complementing the decorations beautifully. They're a bit thin, so they're really meant for one-time use.  
738. Excellent quality.  
739. Perfect for parties, dinners, and more.  
740. I bought these thinking they would be similar to other shower shampoo brushes I've used before, but they're not. These have thicker teeth, making it harder to brush through hair, and the plastic isn't soft. When using in the shower, I tried clipping the T-handle to the showerhead, but it constantly slips off after a few seconds. I also noticed that one of the brushes deformed after prolonged exposure to my hair products, which was disappointing. I won't be buying these again.  
741. Absolutely terrible. The product looked and felt nothing like the picture. I had to double-check that I received the correct item. This has been my worst Amazon purchase, and I returned it immediately.  
742. This Vitamin C serum comes in a smooth, odorless, milky gel that applies effortlessly and absorbs quickly. It features a high-quality formula that rivals those found in premium spas. The serum reduces fine lines and wrinkles, tightens, and hydrates the skin, giving it a fresh, radiant appearance. It works as a deep cleanser, removing impurities while promoting collagen production. The hydrating properties help skin "breathe" by allowing oxygen to penetrate. I've tried many Vitamin C serums, but this one stands out for its gentle yet powerful effects. It's ideal for normal to oily skin types.  
743. These wipes turned out to be too thin and not of great quality. They're only useful if you specifically need kosher wipes.  
744. Complete waste of money. This pump has absolutely no suction power. Very disappointing.  
745. Exactly as pictured.  
746. Received this FootSmart Carepeutic Foot and Calf Massager with Infrared Heated Therapy as a Christmas gift in 2010. Unfortunately, there was an issue with the silver placard, which had come loose and was stuck on the side instead of being on the top as intended. While it was easily fixed, the product still works well for foot and calf relaxation.
747. While the idea behind this product is great, the material used does not hold up well. It feels flimsy and doesn't meet expectations for durability.
748. The product initially worked, but its power was weak from the start. It only functioned a few times before failing to recharge, which was disappointing since recharging was the key feature.
749. These compression socks are by far the most comfortable I've worn. With a variety of vibrant colors, they surpassed my expectations. I was so satisfied that I discarded all my old pairs. The price is excellent, and I’ve already ordered three more sets with plans to buy more in the future.
750. I really liked the design of this hookah, but unfortunately, it arrived damaged and sits crooked. Thankfully, I was able to get a refund and used glue to fix it. It still works, but the initial quality was a letdown.
751. The key I ordered worked perfectly for my toolbox that I had lost the original key to, so it solved my problem efficiently.
752. The two people I bought this for absolutely loved it. They had a great time using it and have no complaints about its quality or performance.
753. Initially, this brush seemed impressive in both appearance and feel. However, after use, it didn’t do much to clean pores as promised. It's a nice-looking brush but falls short in performance.
754. This little box is exactly what I needed. It was easy to assemble, and the lid closes securely. Simple yet effective design.
755. The quality is excellent. I am very satisfied with this purchase, and it definitely met my expectations in terms of sturdiness and reliability.
756. I was disappointed to find that the set included soccer and basketball leis, which weren’t mentioned in the description. I was hoping for Hawaiian leis exclusively and have decided to return the item.
757. I used these insoles in a pair of cheap slip-on shoes, and they worked wonders. Easy to trim, and they fit perfectly. They’re incredibly comfortable and have turned my once uncomfortable shoes into a much better pair. After a few hours of walking, they molded to my foot shape and have held up well.
758. This tool did exactly what it was advertised to do. I bought it for applying medicated lotion to my back, and it works well. The vinyl end is easy to clean, and the long handle makes it convenient for reaching my back. Great for those who need help applying medication to hard-to-reach spots.
759. These earplugs work well, and I no longer need to use makeshift options like balled-up tissues. The only drawback is the noise from the cord when it moves around, which can be distracting during quiet study sessions. I don’t mind it for other activities like yard work, though.
760. The product met my needs, but I was disappointed to find that many were broken, and the plastic material was not as expected. The packaging did not include the description details, so I will not be ordering again.
761. This device works effectively and has strong suction power. It’s easy to use and clean, and it helped with blackheads after consistent use. If you leave it in one spot too long, it can bruise, but otherwise, it’s powerful and does the job well.
762. My daughter loves this toothbrush. It’s the perfect size for her small mouth and makes brushing much more comfortable for her.
763. The taste is unpleasant, but I have to admit it helped me get pregnant! I just wish it came in tea bags rather than a powder form, as that would be more convenient.
764. After being on a ketogenic diet for two years, I found this Ketone Breath Meter to be the most accurate way to test my ketone levels. It’s easy to use and provides clear results. I can now better track whether certain foods throw me out of ketosis. It’s a great tool for anyone serious about keto.
765. This product does exactly what it claims. Simple and effective.
766. The packaging was disappointing, very generic and small. It’s not something I would feel comfortable giving as a gift.
767. These shoes caused me a lot of discomfort, to the point where I couldn’t stand for long. Unfortunately, returning them cost me more than I paid for them in the first place.
768. The product works just as expected. It performs well and meets my needs, no surprises.
769. I was specifically looking for a long chain (around 29-30 inches), and this one is perfect. I bought two, and they arrived in 11-12 days. The copper-colored beads still look great after a month of use. However, it is currently unavailable.
770. This mop is hands down the best I’ve ever owned. The exchangeable pads are so convenient, and it’s super easy to wring out. It’s been a few months now, and it’s still holding up well. The quality is top-notch.
771. This product is fantastic, and I highly recommend trying it! I had a small issue, but the customer service team resolved it quickly and efficiently.
772. This is a great option for my mom, who is legally blind. She can easily check the time, and I'm especially happy that I found it in Spanish, which makes it even more useful for her.
773. I love these so much that I bought six! They are the perfect size for all the medications I'll need on my 6-week vacation. Easy to pack and I really enjoy the fun patterns. I had a similar product before, which worked great, and I expect the same quality from these.
774. Unfortunately, these don't stick very well and they are not anti-slip as advertised.
775. These socks are incredibly comfortable. The compression is just right, and they also look fantastic.
776. I was thrilled to receive my order in just 2 days! I have digestive issues (IBS-C), and this Nopal Eye Prickly Pear puree really helps with inflammation and pain relief. It’s not too sweet, and I appreciate that it contains no added sugars. This is a fantastic product, and I think it’s better than the more expensive alternatives I’ve tried.
777. This product is more of a gel than an oil, so I wouldn’t recommend it for massage since it absorbs too quickly. Additionally, it doesn't have a strong chocolate scent, which I was expecting.
778. This set is perfect for caring for a newborn puppy. Though it's single-use, you can still boil them to sterilize. It's essential to measure properly and watch tutorials for safe tube feeding, but it’s definitely a lifesaver.
779. The taste wasn't great, and it didn’t work as well as I had hoped.
780. This lash curler has silicon teeth that help separate lashes, especially after mascara, giving a more natural look. It's affordable and comes with several replacements, which I appreciate.
781. This product fit perfectly as expected.
782. I wish it was clearer, and sometimes it slips off my vape. However, I dropped it once, and it protected my vape perfectly.
783. These brush heads are not as soft as I expected based on the description, which led me to think they would be gentle for sensitive teeth. However, they do fit properly.
784. Recommended by my doctor, and it works well for me.
785. I love the size and charging capabilities of this product! The sound quality is great, and I appreciate the multiple options available. The light changing feature is beautiful!
786. These bars are fantastic—low sugar, high protein, and full of probiotics! They keep me full, sometimes even to the point where I can’t finish the whole bar. My kids love the flavor too, and I prefer this one over the almond flavor. It's hard to find them in stores, though—I wish they were more widely available.
787. While the mint flavor is pleasant, this gum did nothing to curb my appetite, and it's a bit pricey. I would recommend saving your money.
788. These work well and do their job, although they’re a bit hard to breathe through. Honestly, this makes me feel like they’re effective, though!
789. I’ll be making my next purchase soon!
790. The construction is sturdy, and it seems like it will last a long time.
791. I recently discovered this brand of carbonated drinks at Whole Foods, and I’m really impressed. After stopping my consumption of sodas like Coke due to their high fructose corn syrup and empty calories, I wanted a healthier alternative. This brand offers smaller servings with fewer calories. For example, an 8-ounce serving of Q Kola contains just 70 calories, compared to Coke’s 93 calories per 8 ounces. The taste is complex, spicy, and refreshing, offering a similar experience to Coke with about 75% of the calories. Plus, the smaller bottles help keep calorie intake lower. I prefer Q Kola as a healthier, more reasonable option over Coke and other sugary drinks. Additionally, Q makes a sharp, spicy ginger ale that’s surprisingly sophisticated, although a little strong for me to drink straight. It’s a great alternative if you’re looking to cut back on soft drinks and want something with fewer calories.
792. I was disappointed to find that there is no ginseng in this product—only benzocaine, which I can buy cheaply elsewhere. Not worth the price.
793. I had great results with the PMD Arsenal Elite Inferno, so I decided to try the PMD Arsenal X Inferno. After placing two orders, I found out that the product doesn’t even exist despite being listed and pictured online. Very frustrating!
794. These insoles are exactly what I was looking for! They're thin yet supportive, perfect for wearing in my sneakers. Very comfortable.
795. Good product. I would recommend it.
796. The squirrel patrol needed a tail for their flag, and this one worked perfectly for the scouts. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a tail!
797. I bought these for a friend, and they absolutely love them. My friend says they work wonderfully.
798. I really like the design of this mask, and the fabric is comfortable. It has held up well to hand washing, though I haven’t tried machine washing it yet. I gave it 3 stars because the mask didn’t conform well to my face, and there were gaps that let allergens in. Since I can sew, I added a metal strip from a disposable surgical mask to improve the fit, and now it conforms much better. This should have been part of the original design.
799. The product was too short for my needs.
800. I've been using this product for years to keep my feet smooth, and it’s been consistently effective.
