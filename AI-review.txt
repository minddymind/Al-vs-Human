Here is a rephrased version of all 1000 reviews provided:

1. Unfortunately, I had to return it as it was uncomfortable to ride due to my weight. The return process was disappointing—a $400 charge I’ll be paying off for months. It’s made me hesitant to shop again.
2. It’s unusable for me as it’s much larger than expected. I underestimated how big 20mm would be.
3. After experiencing vision loss, I needed a comfortable eyepatch. This product feels silky smooth and accommodates swelling without discomfort. The strap is gentle yet secure. I highly recommend it over hard plastic alternatives.
4. I hoped this would ease the pain in my foot but instead, the elastic caused more discomfort. It’s a waste of money for me, unfortunately.
5. I’d love a corn bag with more compartments. Though shorter than expected, it’s easy to heat and very comfortable to use.
