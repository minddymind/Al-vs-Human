1. Unfortunately, I had to return it as it was uncomfortable to ride due to my weight. The return process was disappointing—a $400 charge I’ll be paying off for months. It’s made me hesitant to shop again.
2. It’s unusable for me as it’s much larger than expected. I underestimated how big 20mm would be.
3. After experiencing vision loss, I needed a comfortable eyepatch. This product feels silky smooth and accommodates swelling without discomfort. The strap is gentle yet secure. I highly recommend it over hard plastic alternatives.

345. Works as advertised but requires patience—nails soften overnight.
346. Best delivery system for medication—doesn’t sting and is highly effective.
347. Misleading photo implies multiple bandages, but only one is included—not a good value.

351. I used this product when I wasn’t feeling well, and within just two days, I felt significantly better! It’s also effective for supporting digestive health. The taste is pleasantly balanced—not too strong or bland.
352. Still in the testing phase, but I’ll provide a detailed follow-up review soon.
353. This brand is exceptional—trustworthy and reliable. The supplement performs exactly as advertised. I appreciate the vegetarian capsules, which are easy to swallow, and the fact that it’s manufactured in a certified U.S. facility. Highly recommend, and I’ll definitely repurchase.
354. Extremely satisfied with this product—no complaints at all.
355. Unfortunately, it lacks the power I was hoping for. Wish I could return it.
356. If you’re in the market for phytoceramides, look no further! I’ve tried several brands, but this one stands out as the best. My experience has shown that products from Utah tend to be of superior quality, and this one is no exception.
357. The instructions mention a “handle” multiple times but fail to clearly identify or illustrate it. Also, while it’s supposed to include two dental cases, mine only came with one. Still, the fit was adequate given the price.
358. Very poor quality. The material is itchy, and the craftsmanship is lacking. The item started falling apart almost immediately, and to make matters worse, it’s non-returnable. Strongly advise against purchasing.
359. Works wonderfully for partials and performs equally well on full dentures. It lasts longer than typical store-bought options.
360. Update: This adapter isn’t compatible with brass knuckle round-tip or Stiiizy cartridges but works perfectly for flat-head cartridges. It’s user-friendly, though positioning sometimes requires a bit of adjustment. It enhances filtration, making live resin smoother on the throat. A great addition for anyone looking to upgrade their cartridge-to-water pipe experience.
361. I’ve been using this for three weeks, and while it functions adequately, it’s not rust-proof as advertised. Given the misleading claims, I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller.
362. These are simple, effective, and compact. They work well with most masks that don’t have particularly thick ear loops. Bonus: they’re reusable when paired with disposable masks.
363. Smells wonderful, and the colors complement my bathroom decor perfectly.
364. It’s adjustable and easy to attach to mask ear loops. However, it tends to slide down toward my neck, which can be frustrating. While it alleviates ear strain compared to wearing the mask directly, it doesn’t meet my expectations entirely.
365. My legally blind mom needed an address book to organize her contacts, and this was perfect. It provides ample space for names, addresses, and phone numbers.
366. This is so convenient to use! The wide opening makes it easy to fill with water, and the simple design lets you adjust the temperature quickly. Worked flawlessly right out of the box.
367. While harnessing zero-point energy would revolutionize science, the claims surrounding these products lack credible evidence. In-depth research suggests their efficacy remains unproven, and the demonstrations provided often fail to address serious or visible conditions. Proceed with skepticism.
368. This is the only product that works effectively for my baby girl, alongside their cream. I’ve used it since she was five months old, and now, at 11 months, it continues to deliver excellent results.
369. Perfect for adding a touch of flair. The material is durable, and the jumbo safety pin ensures it stays securely fastened.
370. This was exactly as described. It fits my son’s PS Vita and games perfectly.
371. After several attempts, none of the units worked despite trying different vendors. Great concept, but execution is lacking.
372. Disappointed that the liquid version of Mangosteen is no longer readily available, as the capsules don’t seem as effective.
373. After a week of use, I noticed a significant boost in energy and focus, making it ideal for long workdays. The liquid formula absorbs more efficiently than pills, thanks to advanced liposomal technology. Highly recommend it for anyone needing vitamin B12.
374. I love how this product adds flavor to my water while including collagen. The texture was slightly thicker than I expected, but it blends well. Overall, a great addition to my daily routine.
375. Unfortunately, after months of use, my hair loss remains an issue. Wouldn’t recommend.
376. This is fantastic for keeping my floors clean and shiny. It’s easy to use and much more efficient than sweeping. A must-have!
377. These earmuffs are great! The sound quality is decent, and I like that the cord is detachable. They’re a budget-friendly alternative to pricier brands and fit comfortably.
378. My husband’s glasses no longer slip thanks to these! He even prefers wearing glasses over contacts now. Highly recommend.
379. Frustrated with the price hike on this item. It’s disappointing to see such inconsistency.
380. Very user-friendly and straightforward to operate.
381. Love it! This tool is perfect for my massage work and brings me joy.
382. Sturdy and exactly as shown. Easy to assemble and complemented my rose gold party theme beautifully.
383. A lovely retrospective collection. While not a collector’s item unless signed, it’s still enjoyable.
384. Affordable and effective heating pad. The design could be improved for durability, as mine broke during use. Still, a good option for the price.
385. Gentle and effective for sensitive skin. Works well with body scrubs. Highly recommend.
386. While it’s a cute bulldog design, it’s not suitable as a stress ball—it’s too rigid.
387. Exceptional quality and effortless to use.
388. While the style is appealing, the chain tends to flip over, and the length isn’t ideal. Returned it.
389. Promising so far—seems like a good purchase.
390. These inserts are fantastic and enhance comfort in all my shoes.
391. I can’t handle the chalky texture. Into the compost it goes.
392. These thongs fit snugly and provide firm support, ideal for special occasions. Sizing runs small, so consider ordering one size up.
393. Cleans well but lacks a stronger fragrance that I prefer.
394. This book is fantastic—great condition, thoughtful prompts, and adorable design. However, completing it requires significant time and effort.
395. Not as durable as the original version. Still, it’s an acceptable alternative for those who prefer less height.
396. My husband likes it—that’s all I know!
397. Purchased for my husband’s pain management, and it works wonders! It’s heavy enough for effective use and the strong setting suits our needs perfectly. Might get a backup!
398. A delightful romantic comedy with a great soundtrack. Highly recommend for fans of lighthearted entertainment.
399. Excellent product—couldn’t be happier!
400. Absolutely love it—thank you!
401. Works great  
402. This was a sturdy ice scraper. Mine previously had a broken handle. So I was pretty happy with a new one. This was great because not only does it scrape ice off my car, but it also extends. Mine before hadnt done that. Overall, Im quite content with my purchase.  
403. Very unsatisfied with product no type of suction and it keeps cutting off. I will be returning it.  
404. Cute cover, but as we found out - there are a lot of different Samsungs out there, so this didnt fit. Our fault. Find one for your specific model.  
405. Its just not what it says it is, and that is all. Sadly and disappointing.  
406. Bitter, bitter, bitter I still drank it in different ways, hot, cold, in different rooms, lol. I did not receive a relaxed feeling. I do not foresee me purchasing this product again.  
407. Could have sworn I could return this if I purchased through Amazon. Total waste of money Smells awful WASTE OF MONEY.  
408. I love these They are so much better than I anticipated  
409. These are great 7day pill boxes. They come apart to fill with pills. Once back together, the button in the middle spins by one day with each press. The little dispenser drawer flips down so you can just dump the pills in your hand. Very nice. Lightweight plastic but good quality. Its a little thicker than I expected so my jewelry part use wont work, but I now have colorcoded pill boxes for family travel.  
410. Best glutamine product Mixes well into your favorite drinks Very affordable and great after a workout  
411. Great product at a good price  
412. It is easy to use, and it works. I was thinking it is just another piece of but it really works.  
413. SO MUCH SMALLER than what the size chart said, so I dont know where these are made, but they should check their size chart because Im VERY DISAPPOINTED GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER.  
414. Works great Keep them in the car for after car washes  
415. The three stars are not for the pool itself, which is pretty awesome, but since the company that sells it, Plumstruck, deserves zero stars, I compromised and used three. Other reviews have mentioned the ladder issue, but since the description specifically mentions a ladder, I thought the problem was fixed. When Amazon and I both contacted Plumstruck about the fact that there was no ladder included with the pool, Plumstruck repeatedly ignored my comments about their false advertising and just sent me the same letter again saying that they were sorry but the ladder is not included. Since the pool is useless, even dangerous without the ladder, this issue must be addressed by the ad. That being said, Amazon does have comparable ladders available for a reasonable price, so if the company would just change their wording, people could figure all of this out in advance. Amazon is investigating the company, so hopefully all of this will change. Some people mentioned a heater, but there is no heater with the pool and it is not mentioned in the description. I was actually worried it would only work with the heater and I didnt want to have to use a 220 outlet, so I was relieved that it doesnt have one. If I decide I need a heater later, I will go to my local pool supply and show them a picture of the pool and get their recommendation. I will never order anything through Plumstruck again. They are a horrible company. If you can find this pool through someone else, I recommend it. It is small enough to fit comfortably in the garage, but deep enough to get in a full aerobic workout. I also want to add that Amazon sells a saltwater conversion system that my local pool store also sells for a lot more money that the pool representative says will work with this pool, so I will soon be able to convert it to saltwater.  
416. Perfect storage case to encase the massager and long plug  
417. These are billed as medium toothbrushes. They are super soft, like little kid toothbrushes. I dont even feel like they are cleaning my teeth. No bristle shedding observed tried two of the pack so far. The head and handle are a little rough, but I didnt experience any splinters. But if your mouth is so sensitive you need this level of softness in a bristle, the wood might be too much for you.  
418. I never thought Id order a broom online, but years ago I bought this brand for a great price at our local hardware store and it was the best broom I had ever used. I have never found another since then that even comes close. I even replaced the old handle when it broke so I could keep using it instead of buying any of the new ones I could find locally. So, I came online to see if I could find one since my old one was finally getting to the beyond happy stage after YEARS of hard use. And lo and behold... Amazon had one. I paid significantly more for this one than I did my original one and its worth every penny. This one is bigger... I originally had the 9. The reason I like it is that the bristles are not too stiff but flexible enough to actually sweep debris without flinging it across the floor and the ends are frayed and dense enough to actually sweep finer debris instead of passing over it. Id repurchase this several times over, happily. It has made me a broom snob, lol :)  
419. I dont actually know if these work or not, because they are so thick that my feet wont fit into any of my shoes if I put these into them first.  
420. These diapers, if you get the bundle packs off of honestcom, will cost you as much as the organic diapers bought off the shelf. The difference is that these diapers hold sooo well. My son was breastfed the first 6 months, and breastfed babies poo a lot and its always runny. Never had a leak. Organic diapers along with organic wipes and creams have been the only thing that has helped my son and his super sensitive skin. I highly recommend the whole Honest baby line.  
421. Stands up great on solid floors. It is also flexible, making it very easy to use. Gives the added stability needed in a way that’s not as bulky as most. I love it!  
422. Loved these! They were perfect for my wedding pies and my guests loved them!  
423. I love it. Smells so earthly. This stuff gives me so much energy!! I recommend  
424. Good masks. Fit well. Liked the assurance of the filters.  
425. Dont think that they are real propolis or worth it.  
426. I just saw that one of them is already expired. I purchased this on April 16, 2018. The box was expired on Jan 2018.  
427. Perfect size to grip. Its soft but not too soft. Easy to clean.  
428. Lot 792 has a funky mixture. Its different than the usual formula. I hope it is safe and as the label states The last shipments have had this lot so Im wondering if this is the last supply of this product since it seems to be out of stock most places  
429. A little heavy, but its great.  
430. Gets bugs off easy and the bike stayed looking clean Very few bugs stuck after using it.  
431. I really wanted this to work out, and I was originally excited when I first started using this. I was surprised after charging how quickly the battery died, and now it will not charge after only one use. My poor dog looks goofy because half their body was cut (fur was only a couple of inches and well brushed). I will be returning because I am very disappointed.  
432. Been using this for a while on my daughter and no rash at all she can use this product without reacting, thank God. It’s the only thing with a scent that she can use.  
433. Product is a little small, so if you order and want a snug fit, you might want to go up a size.  
434. Smells wonderful!!! This is our second bottle.  
435. Large amount. Works great for saltwater fly patterns. Only thing Id like to see is a pure white color. Other than that, its perfect.  
436. Collagen is a part of my daily routine, usually in coffee, since coffee is part of my daily routine. Each packet has 35 calories and 9g of protein, all from cow collagen peptides. Unflavored, so nothing to interfere or overly sweeten. Pricier than similar collagens, and the serving size is larger than some others as well. Still, these are convenient packets for on the go. The packets are thoughtfully designed, very easy to open. No scissors needed.  
437. Always disappointed when you find out they lie about their size lol. This is NOT 7 inches more like 3. This is definitely a mini massager.  
438. This battery is even better than the original batteries that came with my hearing amplifier So far lasting from 530 am to 7 pm. We’ll see how long it takes to start running down faster. Great buy.  
439. This stuff is the absolute bees knees I only couldnt give it 5 stars because the product came in damaged and the cap was busted, so about 13 of it was already spilled out. The product itself worked amazingly! My hands are dirty and greasy from handling thousands of tires in a day at my job. And even with gloves on, the dirt and grease still seeps through and covers my hands, nails, and nails bed area in filth! I always seem to get black stains stuck to my skin and the dirt and grime doesnt want to come off without a lot of scrubbing, but when I tried this product, I just applied a small amount to my hands, scrubbed, and it cleaned my hands right up without a lot of effort! The best hand cleaner I’ve used in a long time, and I’ve used a ton of them. Its got a pleasant scent too. Please don’t send out damaged containers again, though!  
440. This seems like a nice product. However, as far as keeping it off my vanity - it is so large that it really takes up more space than expected. Still keeping it, though.
441: This small bottle has been a great help in easing my tension and nervousness. I appreciate that it's made from all-natural ingredients with no harmful chemicals or side effects. I'm a big fan of many Bach remedies, and this one is no exception.
442: The brush works well, though it's slightly shorter than expected. It was a bit messy at first with some fibers shedding, but overall, it's the best option for my needs. I needed something that could fit through a narrow bottleneck and preferred to avoid animal bristles for ethical reasons.
443: These are definitely my go-to masks! They fit my face perfectly and are incredibly comfortable. Highly recommend.
444: Unfortunately, these didn’t work for me. They kept slipping off my face, which made them uncomfortable to wear.
445: I had to return these as they weren’t usable in the shower. The box clearly stated "NOT WATERPROOF," which made them unsuitable for my needs.
446: This is, without a doubt, the best film Ving Rames has ever been a part of. His performance was extraordinary, totally out of the box compared to his usual roles. The way he portrayed a gay drag queen showed an incredible depth of empathy and understanding, deserving of recognition, even if this particular film doesn't qualify for an award.
447: Absolutely love it!
448: I bought this at Walmart for $2.64 for a 19.4 oz bottle. Great price!
449: Unfortunately, I can't use the cover for storing or travel as it doesn't fit securely, and it doesn’t sit properly on the base. The bamboo-like popsicle stick is also a bit of a letdown. Might return it.
450: I love the design of the pouring spout – it’s easy to pour quickly, and the attached measuring cup is very convenient.
451: After reading numerous frustrated reviews about digital bathroom scales, I can confidently say this one is an exception. It provides consistent readings, varying by no more than 0.2 lbs, and often stays exactly the same each time. It's a reliable scale and worth the investment!
452: This card feels premium, perfect for professional settings. I will continue buying them, and the sympathy cards are a great value too.
453: L-carnitine is an excellent supplement for overall health.
454: I was looking for latex insoles because I love the comfort of latex bed pillows and have used them in some Naot shoes before. These insoles were just as comfortable, but the size options were limited. My toes didn’t fit perfectly in my shoes, but the rest of my foot felt great. I would buy another pair.
455: Great product and fast shipping. Thanks so much!
456: I love this leave-in treatment! I’ve been using it for years, and it smells amazing.
457: Does exactly what it promises!
458: I had given up on curling lashes with old-fashioned curlers, but this rechargeable lash curler works wonders. It's easy to use, has four heat settings, and a cover to protect it when not in use. The best part? It’s rechargeable, so no batteries needed. I prefer curling my lashes before applying mascara to avoid clumping. At this price, it’s a steal!
459: I’ve used a Genumedi knee support for over 25 years and was thrilled to find a replacement. It offers the same comfort and high quality as the original. Very pleased with this purchase.
460: A perfect large-print Bible for my wife, who is Korean. It’s easy to read and great for anyone who can read Korean.
461: Great product, helps with boosting energy levels.
462: I’ve been using neroli hydrosol for years and was excited to try this supposedly organic version. Unfortunately, it had an overpowering scent, unlike the mild one I’m used to, and caused irritation on my skin. I doubt it's pure neroli.
463: This product does exactly what it’s supposed to. Very satisfied.
464: It arrived earlier than expected!
465: I bought this flameless candle expecting it to resemble a real candle, but the cord and plug ruined the illusion. It looks more like a weirdly lit lamp. The scent is nice when you're close, but the overall design is a letdown. Not worth the price.
466: The product works well, though the inside finish is a little rougher than I expected. Still, it’s a good buy for the price.
467: Simply the best out there!
468: I like this product.
469: This breath analyzer is not entirely precise, but it’s great for tracking alcohol levels over time. It’s small enough to keep in your pocket or car key.
470: At first, I didn’t like this toothpaste due to its fruity taste, but after using it for two months, I’m hooked. It cleans well and brightens teeth without the grit that other products sometimes leave. The only downside was the long wait for delivery, but it was worth it.
471: Purchased for my dog – works great.
472: My wife loves it!
473: Exactly what I wanted and received.
474: Very durable product, and I love that it doesn’t leave grease marks on the outside when food is stored.
475: I really like these socks. They feel silky and are great for my swollen ankles. I just wish they were available in more colors.
476: High-quality part, but it turned out to be too big for my application.
477: After using Drip Drop to replace regular water during my dehydration treatment, I was able to remove my PICC line and return to normal activities. I just wish it were more affordable.
478: As expected.
479: This product is uncomfortable, and I can’t fall asleep with it on.
480: I like the taste, but I’m not a fan of some of the ingredients.
481: There are only two bags in this order, not four as expected. They are very small, more like small and extra-small sizes. While well made and attractive, they aren’t worth the price.
482: Perfect product, just as expected. Would recommend.
483: These don’t work at all. I still see trails from whatever is digging in my yard, and one of them was even moved after just one night. A waste of money.
484: The tags are pretty, but keep in mind that you have to pay for returns.
485: This product works well and I’m satisfied with it.
486: It’s okay, but I thought it would be a little sturdier.
487: This brush feels great and glides easily through my fine hair. It’s also very comfortable to hold.
488: I bought these for facial pain relief, and they fit perfectly. I use flour sack cloths as covers, and they work wonders for my migraines. They have truly made a difference.
489: Nice and comfortable.
490: It was really convenient having everything in one package.
491: These are perfect for my elderly grandmother. She can easily reach her back with them.
492: I have a 6-year-old boy, so I use these all the time for him and for DIY projects around the house.
493: I lost 9 lbs in just 10 days—something I never thought would happen. I’m so pleased with the results and have already ordered more.
494: The material is great, and my cat loves it.
495: If you’re on the fence about this product, go for it! It really helped with my hormones, even with the hormone issues I’ve been dealing with.
496: I’m focusing on making healthier choices, and this product is part of that journey.
497: My holistic doctor recommended this to help absorb toxins. The method is to add 10-15 drops to hot water to neutralize harmful components in cilantro. I've been taking it alongside other detox products and herbs.
498: Dr. Mercola’s name guarantees quality, and I trust this filter wholeheartedly.
499: This kit is not top-tier quality, but it’s a good starting point for learning to tattoo. It includes everything you need to get started: two guns, needles, practice skin, and more. However, there are no instructions, so you’ll have to figure things out online. One of the guns arrived broken, and the other stops working randomly. While the quality isn’t great, this kit can be helpful for practicing on non-skin surfaces. But if you want to tattoo real skin, you’ll definitely need to upgrade.
500: The product was exactly as described.
